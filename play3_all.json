My goal for this truck is to design and make a chassis that is much agiler and capable on the rocks, but that can still rip around a trail and have fun with friends when the time comes.

These will make our chassis plates. Secondly, we will need some screws to hold it all together, so get 8 1'' long steel screws and 8 2\" long steel screws. These screws are available at you local hobby store, and you will need matching hex drivers to put them in. In case you want to build your own RC crawler, here is the parts list;\n-Two Axial Wraith complete axles with links included, available from e-bay among other places\n-An Axial Wraith centre transmission with the motor plate and gear cover with axles. you may have to buy the axles separately, but the axles used on the Traxxas slash work great, once you drill the bottom out.\n- a set of electronics, ie a brushed or brushless speed control, a motor, a servo (the bigger the better), a transmitter and receiver set and a lipo OR nickel metal hydride battery\n-A set of four shocks, with long travel (the axial ones are good). plastic or aluminium body, it doesn't really matter for our purposes\n- Four bead lock wheels and four rock crawling tires\n-All assembly screws, which should come with the set of axles, transmission and extra parts.

A sanding block is optional but recommended. Drill bits that are slightly smaller diameter as the shaft of our screws, but leaves room for the threads of the screw to bite into the plastic of our chassis to hold it together will also be required. Finally, we will also need hex drivers (1.5mm, 2mm, 2.5mm) to disassemble the original truck and assemble our chassis. A drill is good since the plastic is pretty tough, and we can save time and our wrists by putting the screws in most of the way with the drill.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5Y/CU12/IHTEVXJC/F5YCU12IHTEVXJC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: The Tools"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Now comes the design of the chassis itself. do design the chassis, we first need to look at what makes a successful rock crawler chassis. after many hours of looking on the internet, I have narrowed it down to two things; the overall GC (lower to the ground is better) and the amount of grip and flexibility the chassis has, in terms of keeping the wheels on the ground. This Includes having the most ground clearance possible. Now this is simple for a motor on axle crawler (for example, the Axial XR-10) where the motors are on the axles so there are no driveshafts in te way. however, we are working with a shaft driven design with only one motor. Almost all competition rock crawlers have a chassis that is centred on keeping the weight low to the ground, and that is hat we will base our chassis design off of. We will design a chassis that has enough ground clearance for our needs, as well as a low centre of gravity to keep the weight low.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 4: The Theory"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "With our goal and theories in mind, we can start the design. My personal idea was to have the ability to use full stick packs, such as a 5000mah 2 cell lipo in my crawler for longer run times, while still being able to use a smaller battery out front to help with more challenging sections and competition courses. I found out that the only way to mount the battery lower in the chassis but still use a large battery was to mount the battery in front of the spur/pinion gear cover, but resting on the transmission case, as shown in the pictures. This posed a problem, however. It meant that when I ran the motor in the forward \"normal\" direction, the wheels were turning backwards. In my case, I simply took apart the axles and reassembled them upside down (flipped over). However, this could be avoided by simply wiring the motor backwards, with the positive to the negative and so on. This will not damage the motor, and will just reverse the rotation of the motor. Be aware, however, that this may require different driveshafts to make work. The Traxxas plastic driveshafts work well, but the bottom needs to be drilled out to for the axle and transmission yolks to fit. To mount a smaller 2200mah 2 cell lipo in the front, like those used in a 1/16 scale Traxxas car/truck, I found a 1\" wide piece of a brass flat bar at my local hobby store and cut it to 6\". I then mounted my servo to one side and left the other side for the battery. It was a quick fix but seems to work very well for what I need. I then made a 4\" long link with some steel tubing and threaded rod, as well as some ball ends to complete the front battery tray.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0R/ZK9G/IHTEVWLW/F0RZK9GIHTEVWLW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F77/PLG2/IHTEVWLV/F77PLG2IHTEVWLV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: The Design"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Included here are a photo of the plans for the chassis of the crawler, as well as the other pieces used in construction.

Worth mentioning that the holes drilled in the middle of the two holes used to hold the chassis the motor mount plate are not all the way through, just enough so that the pegs can seat in nicely.

Although I was happy with my first try, I was starting to get seriously frustrated with how many 9v batteries it was going through. The pump I used (same in in this \u2018ible) is for a windscreen washer and runs on 12v\u2019s. Running it on 9v\u2019s worked ok but as soon as the voltage reduced, it would slow down and start to sputter.\nThis time I went with 2 Li-ion batteries. Each battery is 3.7v, making 7.4v for 2 of them together. Even though the voltage doesn\u2019t come to 12v, the amperage more than makes up for it. The biggest benefit I have found though is the pump is tonnes more powerful and the batteries last a hell lot longer.\nInitially I installed a step-up voltage regulator to bring the power up to 12v. Throughout the \u2018ible you\u2019ll see images of the regulator. The reason why I wanted to add one was 2 fold; first, I thought bringing the voltage to 12v would mean more power for the pump. Second, the charging module that I brought would only charge 1 battery at a time or 2 in series. I wired-up the batteries so that they were in series and would charge as 3.7v. I ran into problems though with the voltage output to the pump. When I measured the voltage from the regulator it read 12v but when I pulled the trigger and measured the voltage to the motor it only read 3.5v. For some reason the pump was only drawing power from 1 battery. It was probably the way that I re-wired the battery holder to turn it into a series one. This idea I believe would work but I\u2019ll think I\u2019ll leave it for version 3\u2026\nThe way that I got around charging 2 batteries was I added 2 female sockets, one for each battery. It means that you have to charge twice (not ideal) but as charging is infrequent, it doesn\u2019t really matter.\nEnough of me rambling \u2013 let\u2019s get on with the Instructable.", "title": "Nerf Hack - Battery Powered Water Pistol V2", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Nerf-Hack-Battery-Powered-Water-Pistol-V2/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Watch the Video..."}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Bits\n1.

It is fun to play with and to shoot homemade darts into apples. The only downside was the difficulty of assembly. So I developed another version of this same concept that is easier to assemble.\nToday I introduce this Awesome PVC Revolver Marshmallow Gun. It is made entirely out of PVC pipe and PVC cement. As with the last revolver, you turn the barrels by hand to align the pipes for shooting. The faster you turn the barrels, the faster you can shoot.\n[Watch Video]\nThe barrels are easy to load from the side of the gun. Just rotate the barrels as you load each one. And you are ready to fire.\nThe best thing about this blowgun being entirely made out of PVC is the ability to clean it. After shooting several marshmallows, the gun can become sticky with residue. If this happens, just remove the handle and blow pipe at the elbows and wash the residue with warm water. Then set the blowgun on the counter to dry.\nSo let me show you how I built this blowgun.\nMain Barrel\nWith the exception of the handle, I used all 1/2-inch pipe and fittings.\nI first cut 2 pipes, one about 15 inches and one about 8 inches. On the short pipe, I put a mark about 3 inches inward. This allows the main barrel to stick out further as on a real revolver. I then used some PVC cement to attach the 2 pipes together.\nBe careful with PVC cement, it has very strong vapors and should be used outside.\nRotating Barrels\nI next cut 6 pipes to 3 inches long pieces. I then carefully cemented the pipes together around an extra pipe making sure not to get any cement on the extra pipe. I had to wait a few minutes between adding each pipe to give the cement enough time to dry in place. After the cement has fully cured over night, you should be able spin the barrels.\nThe barrels then needed to be filed down smooth and level so the tolerances of the barrels can be tightly assembled. I used a grinding wheel to speed up this process, but a file will work. Make sure to use a breathing mask when grinding and filing.\nIt is now time to slide the revolving barrels over the 15 inch pipe. I then made a mark at the end of the barrels on the top of the center pipe. I then measured the location of where the T-connector would fit and made another mark on the center barrel. The area between these 2 marks needed to slightly flattened so the T-connector outlet would be at the same height as the revolving barrels.\nI also pressed in a short section of pipe into the T-connector on the outlet side, so the holes in the rotating barrels would be the same size to help prevent air loss.\nI then cemented the connector in place with the side outlet facing up. I also added some cement to the sides of the T-connector to add some additional strength. After it fully dried, I used a saw to cut the center pipe even with the T-connector and touched it up with a file.\nHandle\nWith a short section of pipe in the back of the T-connector, I added a 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch adaptor. This allowed me to add some larger 3/4 inch pipe and connectors for a bigger handle. I then attached a 45-degree elbow and 4 inch pipe and an end cap.\nBlow Tube\nOn the top of the T-connector, I added a short pipe, a 45-degree elbow, a 4 inch pipe, and a coupling. All of these are 1/2-inch pipe and fittings.\nThe blowgun is now ready to shoot. Just load up some marshmallows and fire them as fast as you can turn the barrel.\nModified Gun\nThis design can also be modified to eliminate the blowgun ability and make it more of a Cosplay type of gun. It reminds me a lot of the 44 Magnum made famous in the movies.\nInstead of grinding the center pipe flat and adding the T-connector, the adaptor can be added to a shorter center pipe. This way the barrels can still spin for that fun factor.\nPaint\nWith the project now complete, you can paint it any color you wish. Make sure to only paint the outside of the barrels or it may not shoot correctly.\nIt is now time to go impress your friends.", "title": "PVC Revolver Marshmallow Gun Blowgun DIY", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/PVC-Revolver-Marshmallow-Gun-Blowgun-DIY/", "steps": [], "channel": "Toys"}, {"category": "Play", "description": "Here\u2019s a project still in prototyping stages, but it\u2019s a simple one, and maybe appropriate for this time of year, so I\u2019m sharing it now.

In Kessel Run, you play a scruffy-looking smuggler claiming trade routes across the universe, using a ragtag assortment of freighters and attack ships stolen or won in gambling deals, to protect your routes from other mercenaries and villainous scum.\n(While Kessel Run is way cooler than Ticket to Ride, bear in mind that lawyers are not cool, and they will come down on you like Vader if you attempt to sell something like this, using intellectual property from two lucrative entertainment franchises.)\nThis version is a prototype I made to test a few basic principles; at some point I\u2019d like to make a better version that addresses its shortcomings.", "title": "Kessel Run Board Game", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Kessel-Run-Board-Game/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "You\u2019ll need:\nA board of some sort - I used 6mm MDF\nPaint and varnish (I used acrylic)\nA labelling machine, or some other way of marking the place names on the map\nSomething to make the ships out of - I used strips of wood cut down with a circular saw Beading would work better, but is expensive.\nCard, to make the playing cards\nYou\u2019ll also need access to the internet to download the rules, if you don\u2019t know them already, and to download an image of the map you want to copy.\nI used image assets from the Ticket To Ride iPad app to extract route information.

A web search for universe or galaxy will turn up some image inspiration.\nThen, using thick (undiluted) white acrylic and an old toothbrush, flick speckles of white across the board to create star fields. The trick is to use a very dry brush (very little paint), and try to avoid being too directional, but build up the field over several passes from different angles.\nNext, create much bigger stars where your route nodes are (the cities from the Ticket to Ride universe), plus a few more medium stars around the map, where the galaxies look like they need some attention. Use white acrylic to make the stars, then use blue, orange or purple to create fringes around them that match the galaxy colours.\nNow it's time to create your routes. Paint rectangular blocks of colour between each node, sticking to the route lengths on the original map.

For each city on the TTR map, make a note of the corresponding place on your new map.\nNow, make a text file containing all the routes on the Ticket to Ride route card, and the points for each route.

Chess is a game played and enjoyed by all ages, young and old. It is a great game to challenge your mind or just relax with a friend.\nI have always enjoyed to play chess. It relaxes me as well as adds some friendly competition between my friends and I. This is what inspired me to create this project. I wanted to have a custom chess board that was designed, sized, and constructed to how I wanted it. I wanted it to show my personality as well as show something I was interested in. This chess board uses a laser engraver to create a custom design that is the centerpiece of the whole board.\nThe board itself is pretty simple. The top piece of acrylic, which will have a circle design engraved into it, will sit on top. The black squares (or in my case blue) will go underneath that. A border around the middle of the board will serve to house LEDs that will illuminate the board. All of this will be explained throughout the instructables.\nThis instructables will walk you through how I went about designing and constructing the chess board.

This allowed me to see the full scale of the board to make sure I liked it. I had two major pieces that affected my designing. I had the paper that was a full scale model of the board, as described above, and I also had my technical drawing that had all my measurements and specifications. I highly recommend doing both of these in order to make sure the board comes out the way it is supposed to (or how you want it). Both can be seen in the pictures.\nThe general specifications for the board are as follows:\nWhole board: 12 in. x 12 in.\nDiameter of inner circle design: 10 in.\nChess Squares: 1.375 in.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLV/EIJL/IG82YQZZ/FLVEIJLIG82YQZZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKL/PZNK/IG82YR03/FKLPZNKIG82YR03.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Drafting the Design"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The first thing that has to be done is to find the image that you want engraved into the board. The easiest thing to do is use a vector image, which uses points and lines to create the image. You can find the image you want as a vector online or just use a simple image-vector converter which can also be found online. Once you have you image, you will have to use your choice of software to edit it. The software has to be comparable with the laser engraving software. From the start, you should size the image to fit the specifications listed in the previous step.\nThe next part is going to be different depending on the image that you get. The parts of the images that you want engraved need to be black. This is where you will have to play around with the image to get it ready to be compatible with the laser engraving software.\nOnce you have your picture all set up, you are ready to engrave it. You should be sure that your material is either bigger than 12 in. x 12 in. or it is already cut to those dimensions. Along with engraving the image, you also have to set up the correct board dimensions to be cut and the bolt holes to be cut. It is important that you set the 12 in. x 12 in. boarder to be cut out by the laser. This ensures that everything is the right size. Next, you need to cut the 8 bolt holes (2 on each corner). Each will be 3/4 in from the side and centered. The bolt size can be to your discretion, but I used #8-32 bolts, which are about 11/64 in. When you cut the holes, you need to cut them one size up in order to ensure that the bolt will go through and the hole is not too small.\nAfter it is cut and engraved, make sure you keep it safe and nice when your working on the other parts of the project. Keep the paper on in order to protect the clear acrylic, which was scratch very easily. Be sure to also keep the extra 12 in. by 12 in. piece for that will be used in the last step. At some point, you will need to cut the same bolt holes that you did in the top piece (2 on each corner, 3/4 in. from the side and centered), as you did before. This bottom piece will act as a base that everything will sit on. You will attach it in the last step.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSJ/MRDR/IFGNUR2F/FSJMRDRIFGNUR2F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBH/G3IE/IFWTZ5JT/FBHG3IEIFWTZ5JT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Q/D49S/IFWTZ5M1/F1QD49SIFWTZ5M1.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Creating and Engraving Center Design"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The boarder is a very important part of the project because it connects the top acrylic piece (with the design) to the bottom acrylic piece, as well as everything in the middle. The borders borders are made out of 1/2 in. square wooden dowels. The measurements are as follows:\n(2) 11 in.\n(2) 12 in.\nThe above part is pretty simple, just make sure the measurements are correct. This will ensure that everything looks good when it is fitted together. The next thing that needs to be done is to drill the holes that the bolts will go through. The goal of this part is too make sure that the holes line up with the holes that are already cut into the top acrylic piece. Use those holes are you guild holes. You should put the dowel pieces around the outside of the acrylic piece, just like you would if you were actually attaching them. They should line up perfectly to wear they create a perfect boarder on the outside, with none of the boarder hanging off the end (use the picture in the next step as a guide). If there is some excess at the ends, you can sand them down in needed. You should clamp all these pieces right onto the acrylic piece, keeping the border in tact. You can then turn the whole thing over and trace, though the acrylic piece, where you need to drill. This will ensure that when the boarder is present that the bolts will be able to go through both sets of holes perfectly. Before I started drilling, I put a number (1,2,3,4) on each dowel, and then put the same numbers on the side of the square acrylic piece that corresponded with that specific dowel. This will help line things up after you drill. The holes need to be drilled to about 11/64 in., which is one size bigger than the bolts.\nAfter the above steps are completed, you are all set to see if you did everything correctly. You can put your screws threw the board and then put the boarder on. Be sure that each piece is in the original spot that you had it in when you traced through the whole. If you switch two pieces around, it might not come out correctly. Once you put all the pieces on and see that they all fit good, you can move onto the next step!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2N/A684/IG82YR0B/F2NA684IG82YR0B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLP/HUPP/IGB22E22/FLPHUPPIGB22E22.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Developing the Boarder"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The LEDs will be wired into the boarder piece that is below the image (that is, if you are looking at the project from the top, it will be the piece closest to you). This will prove a really cool and clean array of light shining under the square pieces and the laser engraved design.\nYou can start by drilling six holes.These will have to line up centered in the middle six squares on the bottom row. This can be shown in the third picture. The holes will be measured at the following points:\n2 1/2 in.\n4 in.\n5 1/4 in.\n6 1/2 in.\n8 in.\n9 1/2 in.\nI used 5 mm LEDs for this project and a drill bit which is slightly bigger than the LEDs themselves, in order to make sure that they fit.\nOnce you finish this, you can start wiring the LEDs. I wired them in two separate circuits, both in series. This was in order to make sure that all LEDs got the right amount of voltage to stay clean and bright. These were just two simple circuits with two 9 volt batteries.

The blue that I used was an opaque blue, which means that it was not transparent. I then used clear acrylic for the other pieces. Each square is 1.375 in by 1.375 in. This measurement has to be exact because it will ensure that all the square fit perfectly, as shown in the third picture. Once you cut all these out exact, I would suggest that you lay them out and make sure that they fit good and look good. You can easily sand the edge of one of the square if one is slightly to big. To finish, just peal all the paper off the acrylic and lay the pieces out. Finally, you need to cut out a 10 in. x 10 in. piece of acrylic that will lay onto of all the pieces to keep them in place and down. I used a 1/4 in piece, but you can use whatever size you want. They will still be glued later on regardless. Just lay all the pieces down in the correct chess format (alternating colors) and wipe everything down with a clean cloth.

All the individual squares should be peal and laid out, with a piece of clear acrylic laying on top to keep them all together. You should also assembly each side of the boarder in their correct spot, with the on with the LEDs lined up below the design. The next part is critical to make sure everything stays in place. When you lay everything out, use a caulk gun with silicon caulk in it. As seen in the pictures, you should caulk a little dot on all the corners. Also, you should put a dot under all the blue tiles. The reason to do this is because you will not be able to see the caulk when you flip the board over. Overall, you are caulking and attaching the border to the acrylic piece that is holding the individual squares down. Allow time for everything to dry (at least 24 hours).\nYou should wipe everything down and put the 12 in. by 12 in. piece that you saved and cut holes in during the 3rd step. Just attach sit this on top of the project and make sure the bolts go through the holes. Finally, attach the nuts. You are then able to flip the project over and see how it looks!

While solving one shows others how creative you are, it is also a great way to pass time, de-stress, or take your mind off other things.\nLearning to solve a Rubik\u2019s Cube requires patience and persistence. You will not be able to learn how to solve the cube by following the instructions only once; it will require reading through multiple times. I recommend reviewing a few steps and learn to master them before moving on. You will also want to memorize the algorithms listed in parts 5-7 and the notations listed in the Terminology and Notation section.\nAlthough your Rubik\u2019s Cube will not be in the exact position as mine, you can follow the general steps below to help you learn to solve your cube. Finally, I can\u2019t stress enough, that if you are serious about learning to solve the Rubik\u2019s Cube you will want to pay attention to how pieces move around the cube when you are making turns. Understanding the outcome of your moves will help you grasp how to put pieces where you want them.\nHow to Use These Instructions: This method of solving the Rubik\u2019s Cube will be outlined in seven parts. Each part contains a series of steps and turns, which will result in a very identifiable outcome to complete each part. At the beginning of each part, I will include a brief description of the desired outcome for the part. Within the steps, I will list the turns I made on my Rubik\u2019s Cube to compete the step. I will also include images of how my Rubik\u2019s Cube looks when making each turn. Although you will not be making the exact turns I make for most of the steps, you will be able learn how to get pieces to move where you want them to.\nThis method of solving the Rubik\u2019s Cube allows me to solve it in about two minutes (others can solve it faster).\nParts:\nPart 1 - Create a 2x2 Block (Steps 1-6)\nPart 2 - Add to the 2x2 Block to Create a 3x2 Block (Steps 7-10)\nPart 3 - Fixing the Inverted Edges (Step 11)\nPart 4 - Finish the Bottom Two Layers (Steps 12-13)\nPart 5 - Place the Remaining Corners in the Correct Places (Steps 14-15)\nPart 6 - Twist the Top Corners (Steps 16-18)\nPart 7 - Place the Remaining Edges (Steps 19-20)\nRubik\u2019s Cube Basics and Concepts: A traditional Rubik\u2019s Cube (3x3) has six faces (sides) and three types of pieces. It is important to understand that the center pieces never move in relation to the other center pieces. For example, the white center piece is always opposite the yellow centerpiece. Please note that if the Rubik\u2019s Cube comes apart, you should always put it back together solved, or you will likely put it back together in an unsolvable state.\nTerminology and Notation:\nFace \u2013 A side of the cube. There are six faces and may be referred to by its position as you are looking at it or by its center piece.\nCenter Piece \u2013 A one-color piece in the center of a face.\nEdge Piece \u2013 A two-color piece between corner pieces. There are 12 edge pieces on a Rubik\u2019s Cube.\nCorner Piece \u2013 A three-color piece. There are 8 corner pieces on a Rubik\u2019s Cube.\nLayer \u2013 A 3x1 set of pieces that can be turned on the Rubik\u2019s Cube.\nTop Layer (T) \u2013 As you are looking at the Rubik\u2019s Cube, it is the layer on the top of the cube.\nBottom Layer (b) \u2013 As you are looking at the Rubik\u2019s Cube, it is the layer on the bottom of the cube.\nFront Layer (F) \u2013 As you are looking at the Rubik\u2019s Cube, it is the layer you are looking at.\nBack Layer (B) \u2013 As you are looking at the Rubik\u2019s Cube, it is the layer opposite the layer you are looking at.\nRight Layer (R) \u2013 As you are looking at the Rubik\u2019s Cube, it is the layer on the right side of the cube.\nLeft Layer (L) \u2013 As you are looking at the Rubik\u2019s Cube, it is the layer on the left side of the cube.\nTurn \u2013 A \u00bc rotation of a layer in a clockwise direction.

Understanding it would be easier to make the larger design smaller than the other way around, I looked to the proven MetaVulcan as a starting point for the new design. To increase wing loading whilst improving airframe strength, the aircraft was designed with a new type of airfoil fold which was developed for it during the aircraft's genesis (originally, the prototype had the same platform but lacked these folds, hurting it). With the new configuration, the aircraft proved itself quite impressive.

This is a fun toy to have and fairly easy to assemble.\nI first pulled the connections apart where the blow pipe attaches to the T-connector. The T-connector is now getting replaced with a 4-way connector. This will allow our reloading clips to connect quickly. I will show how to make those in a moment.\nBefore putting the 4-way in place, I first had to roll up some paper and wedge it in the pipe at the front of the stock. This is to prevent any pellets from rolling backwards into the stock.\nI next measured the length from the front edge of the blow pipe to the end of the barrel. This is about 17 inches\nTo make this gun work with airsoft pellets, I needed a much smaller tube inside of the PVC. The simplest way is to use a 5/16 inch metal brake line. These can be picked up at your local auto parts store for a few dollars.\nThe 17 inch measurement would make the brake line even with the end of the PVC but I will be adding a coupling to the end of the barrel so I used a small pipe cutter to trim the brake line to 18 inches.\nThe brake line needs to be centered in the PVC, so I wrapped it with some paper at the inlet side which will center it and prevent pellets from finding there way down the side of the barrel. I then carefully wedged the brake line in place from the back. The front of the barrel also needs to be centered by wrapping and wedging some paper between it and the PVC.\nI thought about using some glue or expanding foam to hold the brake line in place inside the PVC, but that would make it much harder to clean or repair in the future. I love the option for disassembly so I kept it simple.\nI then added the coupling on the end of the barrel for that added flare. If you wish, the coupling can be drilled along its sides for an even meaner appearance.\nI then reassembled the gun with the 4-way. With this added connection, I wanted to utilize some quick change clips for fast reloading while in battle.\nThe pocket-sized clips are very simple and can each hold around 150 pellets. For each clip you will need 2 end caps, a 45 degree elbow, a 4-inch pipe, and a 1.5 inch pipe.\nI do recommend gluing the all of the connections on the clips except for the pipe that connects to the gun. This will prevent the connections from separating and causing a loss of pellets and time while on the field.\nTo load a clip, have the shorter pipe facing up and remove the end cap. Then carefully slide it into the 4-way connector and twist it upward. The pellets will slide down the tube into the chamber and are ready to be fired. Now just give a long hard blow into the mouth piece and a stream of pellets will fly out of the barrel.\nIf the pellets appear to jam inside of the clip or chamber, a quick hard shake should dislodge any jams and allow for continued firing.\nNow you can paint your gun any color you would like.\nThis is an awesome and yet simple way to impress your friends in your backyard and on the airsoft field.\nIf you enjoyed this project, click the LIKE button and give us a comment telling us your thoughts.\nWe try to put out a video every week, so remember to subscribe so you won\u2019t miss out on future projects.\nHave fun and be safe playing.", "title": "Airsoft Machine Gun Sniper Rifle DIY PVC Blowgun", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Airsoft-Machine-Gun-Sniper-Rifle-DIY-PVC-Blowgun/", "steps": [], "channel": "Airsoft"}, {"category": "Play", "description": "This Halloween, my girlfriend and I decided to try a \"Steampunk\" theme, and after seeing how alternatively terrible/expensive pre-made \"steampunk\" costumes were, I decided to try and put something together myself.\nThis is the first Instructable I've ever made, so I hope it's not terrible!\n\nOf course, the first thing any steampunk adventurer/time-traveler/airship-captain needs is a handy side-arm!\nI'm not very good at crafts, and the only thing I \"Steampunked\" (and I use the term loosely) was an old computer for an art project back in high-school.... but I decided to give it a shot anyway!\nI had seen several really great instructables on how to steampunk different Nerf guns, and was set on doing the \"Hammershot,\" because I though it looked the most old-fashioned. Unfortunately, the local store didn't carry the Hammershot, and since this was the first \"crafty\" thing I've really done, I figured I should start small... Enter the \"Doublestrike!\"\nA small Nerf gun that looks a little like a revolver, and operates like a derringer, the Doublestrike is an ideal gun to start with, in my opinion, because it already looks a little old-school, and it's pretty cheap. You can usually find one for around $10.\nIt was ideal for experimenting with, so that's what I did. It's not really a \"mod,\" but more of a glorified paint-job. However, while it's not perfect, it's a first attempt, and really easy to do.\nSupplies:\n- Nerf Doublestrike\n- Rustoleum \"Hammered\" metallic spray-paints. (These are great because they come out textured, and cover up surface oddities. I used their copper, silver, and black colors.)\n- \"Found Objects\" gears. (usually run about $5-$10, these are carried by most craft stores in the jewelry or scrap-booking section.)\n- Copper wire (just had it in my garage)\n- Sandpaper, painter's tape, and a strong adhesive (I just used Krazy Glue)", "title": "Steampunk DoubleStrike Nerf Gun", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Steampunk-DoubleStrike-Nerf-Gun/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "First things first, to properly paint it, we need to take it apart and get it ready.\nAnother reason I discovered the Double-strike is a great \"first-try\" gun, is because the internals are almost completely self-contained, which makes assembly/dis-assembly really easy.\nIMPORTANT: Something I did NOT do, but wish I had, was to take a picture of the guts before you remove them. Make sure you have marked how everything goes together, or you'll be like me and scrabbling on Google for a half-hour trying to figure out how the torsion spring for the trigger fits back in.\nThe first thing I did after taking it apart was deciding exactly what I wanted/needed to paint. Eventually, I decided to leave the handle alone, since the \"wrapped\" look was pretty much what I wanted already, although it is something that could easily be stained or repainted for a weathered look.\nThen I sanded everything I planned on having painted. This has two functions:\n- It makes the plastic surface more receptive to the paint, and decreases the chance of paint flaking/peeling.\n- Sanding down the logos and raised \"Nerf\" emblems makes them pretty much disappear underneath the paint.\nFinally, I taped up the pieces that were going to be painted.

The nice thing about Rustoleum's \"Hammered\" spray-paint is that it doesn't need any sort of primer.\nThe barrel/hammer/trigger section got a base-coat of silver. This was trickier, as each side had to be done separately, and it never seemed to dry quite properly (a problem if you're impatient like me).\nIt's a good idea to put a paper-clip or something similar through the tiny pin-hole on the trigger, as this is important for the trigger's spring function, and it keeps it from being painted shut. Plus, you can just paint the trigger in one go, holding up by the paper clip and letting it air-dry.\nAfter the base, metallic coats (it may require two or three to get the job done properly) I used the hammered-black spray paint on both the silver and copper sections, gently wiping it with a rag immediately after application. This gave the gun a cool, weathered/scored look, and filled in the cracks and crevices, making it look a little more textured.

I've completed it like 9 months ago, made some modifications today. I named it Altay, took approximately 8 months to complete. Actually I'm very proud of this tank and like it a lot...\n\nIt is a remote controlled knex tank that can move (like a tank), turn its turret horizontally, shoot, reload and shoot again multiple times. I've used mainly knex parts and some rc components... I made a prototype to gain some experience before the main thing...\n\nHere is the list:\n\n\n\n\u2022 ~3000 knex parts\n\u2022 6 modified 6v knex motors\n\u2022 1 servo for trigger\n\u2022 4 ESC (electronic speed control)\n\u2022 6 channel radio transmitter & receiver ( 5 of them is used)\n\u2022 2S (7.4 Volt) LiPo battery\n\u2022 Amper and voltmeter\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n5 Channels:\n\n\n\n1. Left track ( Two motors )\n2. Right track ( Two motors )\n3. Turret rotation horizontal ( left - right) ( One motor )\n4. Ram pin puller ( One motor )\n5. Trigger ( Servo )\n\n\nI planned the 6th channel for vertical turret motion but due to the complexity, I decided not to do it for the time being.\n\nIt has a unique magazine, it uses \"clip with hole\" as ammo.\n\nIn order to increase power and overcome the extra weight of the body and turret, I used dual motors for each track. All motors are 6v dual speed motors and all of them are set at low rpm - high torque mode. I made extra cable connection between the motors and their corresponding esc's so that they can be remotely controlled.\n\nI also modified the motors to hold on the rods more tightly. This is necessary as the motors are equipped with a system that holds the rods loosely in order to protect the motors. This system is over protective and easily lets the rod slip in the slightest need of extra force. Since my tank is heavy and needs high power to move motors were continuously slipping the rods before the modification.\n\nI designed a special gear mechanism that puts the ram pin puller motor in to an idle (neutral) gear so that when the ram pin is pulled all the way back, even if I don't stop the motor from the remote it won't continue to try to pull the ram pin and break things apart...\n\nTrigger mechanism is pulled by a servo.\n\nLet's take a closer look now...", "title": "Altay K'nex Tank", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Altay-Knex-Tank/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "What a magnificent thing you are... :)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FP1/SH61/IEID6O0G/FP1SH61IEID6O0G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRN/VS1H/IEID6O08/FRNVS1HIEID6O08.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFI/FWYL/IEID6NZS/FFIFWYLIEID6NZS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKB/F2ZV/IEID6NZQ/FKBF2ZVIEID6NZQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2A/IIGQ/IEID6NZK/F2AIIGQIEID6NZK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKA/255Y/IEID6NZJ/FKA255YIEID6NZJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9Z/5PSZ/IEID6NZD/F9Z5PSZIEID6NZD.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: View From All Sides"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I've ordered 6 channel receiver & transmitter and other rc equipment from hobbyking .

This is a plastic part that is somewhat flexible and expands a little bit when you push the rod through the hole. I guess this mechanism also serves as a safety precaution that protects the motor by slipping the rod when it's too hard to turn the rod.\nWhile this is nice it also causes the motor to under perform. Under heavy loads, even if the motor has enough power it doesn't turn the rod because of this mechanism. We can hear a clicking sound when this happens.\nThis was a great obstacle for my RC Tank - Altay. There was another requirement for my RC Tank project, preparing the motors to be remote controlled. So I dismantled all the motors and made these two modifications.\nFirst the easy part, making the motor RC ready. Cut some plastic as seen on pictures two make way for the power cable. When we have the power cable soldered it will be ready to be plugged to an ESC for remote control. AFAIK all k'nex motors are brushed motors not the fancy brushless ones. SO when you are picking an ESC it must be brushed motor ESC with the correct voltage parameters.\nThis is the HobbyKing X-Car 45A Brushed Car ESC which is brushed, 2 cell lipo (~7.4 V OK for 6v motor) with reverse capability. This is almost only ESC I found on internet that can be used for this application. There are two options about where to solder the cable:\n1- Directly to the motor.\n2- To the battery department.\nSoldering to the battery department has an advantage of not bypassing the forward reverse switch of motor. So after you've done the RC modification you still have a switch to reverse the motor rotation. So I soldered to the battery department. One more side note, if you have multiple motors to modify solder all red/black cables the same way so once you set all the motors to forward position from the switch they all turn the same direction.\nTo get to the battery department soldering points you must remove another plastic panel that is used to divide the battery compartment in to two.\nI used XT60 connectors at the other end by the way.\nHeavy duty mod:\nYou must take out the gear that holds to the rod. Separate all the parts of that gear set. Take a good look, take notes or take photos before you dismantle the parts, you will have to assemble it all the way back.\nAt the end of dismantling there will be a plastic part that holds the rod. This circular part is not full circle, one side is cut to give it flexibility. There is also a spring around it to keep it tight. The condition of this spring determines how easy the motor will slip and make the clicking sound.\nInside K'nex 6v Motor\nWe will hunt down this flexibility with this modification. But since the flexibility will be gone so will the possibility attach or detach rods. So we will put the circular part on the rod we are going to use (black rigid rods in my case) and make the modification with the rod already attach and we will never try to take this rod out again.\nThe core idea is to make this circular part so tight that it holds the rod and doesn't let it slip. Wrap the circular part with adhesive tape ~10 rounds. Cut the extra pieces so that it can still attach to the other parts. Put on the spring back. Assemble all the parts back. Take care of the rc cable and the blue switch mechanism while closing the motor. Blue switch is the mechanical speed selector that changes the position of middle gear.\nNote: In the video and some pictures you may see some white band pieces around the circular part, this is from the previous modification which has worn out in time.\nThere is also another point where you can *leak* power : the Interlocking clip. If you have motor in good condition - that doesn't slip - and a heavy load then your Interlocking clip may slip the rod and if this starts to happen it wears out the Interlocking clip and if it's worn out it will happen more. You can see the difference between two Interlocking clips one is in good condition, other is dead. Solutions is once again to wrap it with adhesive tape.\nAfter the modification:\nAltay ready to move", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0E/R77C/IGQW4GPM/F0ER77CIGQW4GPM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSA/AUIV/IGPGQQSO/FSAAUIVIGPGQQSO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F83/O9C9/IGPGQRTL/F83O9C9IGPGQRTL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNZ/23PI/IGPGQQTT/FNZ23PIIGPGQQTT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTB/NG0Y/IGPGQRTV/FTBNG0YIGPGQRTV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW4/0X7V/IGPGQRTW/FW40X7VIGPGQRTW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F93/DBOL/IGPGQRUQ/F93DBOLIGPGQRUQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE0/7DJI/IGPGQRUR/FE07DJIIGPGQRUR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO5/59U3/IGPGQRUU/FO559U3IGPGQRUU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO5/RC9S/IGPGQRTX/FO5RC9SIGPGQRTX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK0/4WS4/IGPGQRUT/FK04WS4IGPGQRUT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRS/2EV4/IGPGQRUB/FRS2EV4IGPGQRUB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZX/N98P/IGPGQRUV/FZXN98PIGPGQRUV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9F/SDZT/IGPGQQNU/F9FSDZTIGPGQQNU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: K'nex Motor Heavy Duty & RC Modification"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "I've recorded a FPS view video before:\nI've introduced my tank before on teknoseyir.com :\nWill add some more videos soon...", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 6: Last Words"}], "channel": "K'NEX"}, {"category": "Play", "description": "So I decided to create a Halloween themed prank where a pencil cup mysteriously moves by itself or even flies off of a table next to an unsuspecting co-worker.

(Magda Gerber, who founded RIE - the parenting philosophy to which we mostly subscribe - was Emmi Pikler's student.) In practice this means that parents and caregivers don't put the child into any position they can't get into by themselves - often a hard thing to do as a parent when you want to make sure your child meets the next official milestone 'on time.' It also means giving kids the opportunity to learn how their bodies can move (and climb) \u2013 hence the Pikler Triangle.\nMy 15 month-old daughter has attended a RIE playgroup for nine months now, and the Triangle is one of her favorite toys there so I knew I had to make one. I\u2019m a member of some RIE-related Facebook groups and see requests every once in a while for instructions on how to build one so I took some photos as I went. I\u2019m assuming that a lot of people making kids\u2019 toys might not have a woodworking background (I\u2019m somewhat of a novice myself) so my instructions are fairly detailed. The folding action definitely makes it more complicated; if you don\u2019t need it to fold then you can just screw the Pivot Pieces onto the rails wherever you like and be done with it. Do let me know if anything isn\u2019t clear and please post pictures of your finished projects!\nIf you're interested in Emmi Pikler's and Magda Gerber's approaches to parenting, you'll probably enjoy my podcast which you can find at www.yourparentingmojo.com - it examines scientific research related to child development through a lens of respectful parenting.", "title": "How to Make a Foldable Pikler Triangle (climbing Frame)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-make-a-collapsible-Pikler-Triangle-climbing/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Materials\n1. 12 feet of 2\u201dx3\u201d lumber - I used clear grain Douglas Fir.

You likely lost a bit of length when you were sanding so put the first X 1\u201d below whichever end you decided was the top, and let the rest fall out every 5\u201d from there.

Ideally the dowels will lift easily in and out but a tight fit is OK as long as the dowel does go all the way to the bottom of the hole on the dry fitting as the glue will lube things up.\nYou have two options here.\nOption A:\nFor my prototype I came up with what I thought was a pretty nifty method to screw the dowels into the side rails. I think that\u2019s probably actually overkill as most of the Triangles I\u2019ve seen since are just glued, so my official method is glueing only. But if you want the extra security \u2013 maybe you have very heavy kids? \u2013 use my screw method. Take a 1/8\u201d drill bit and drill straight through the middle of the holes that you made for each dowel, using the divot that the forstner bit made as your guide. Drill all the holes now (don\u2019t try to fit dowels in some and then drill the rest later). Now put a dowel into each hole and tip the whole lot over so the unit is standing on the dowels on the floor and the side rail faces up. Here\u2019s the nifty part: the hole you just drilled becomes a little doweling jig and allows you to drill a pilot hole straight down into the dowel with no further equipment or support needed. I drilled 26 of those things and didn\u2019t pop out the side of the dowel once. Neat, huh? Pilot all of the holes, and then screw a screw into each pilot on both ladders hole EXCEPT the top TWO holes on each side rail of the long ladder.\nOfficial Option B:\nAs described in Option A, drill a pilot hole through the divot left by the forstner bit in the two holes at the top of each of your long side rails ONLY (so, four holes total). You\u2019ll use these holes to attach the long ladders to the Pivot Pieces.\nPut a small amount of wood glue into each of the holes on one long side rail. Use your finger to spread the glue up the sides of the hole, which will help provide lubrication in case any of your dowels are a tight fit. Place a dowel in each hole and hammer each one with a rubber mallet to seat them. Working quickly, glue each of the holes on the other side rail of the same length. Make sure the tops of your side rails are facing the same way. Place the second side rail over the dowels, coaxing them into the holes. When they\u2019re all positioned correctly, bang on the side rail with a rubber mallet to seat the dowels.\nWhichever method you used, complete the short ladder in the same way, except that you screw into all holes if you used the screw method. Put a mark for the bolt about half way between the top of the top dowel and the top of each of the short side rails (that\u2019s a lot of tops).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FO2/Z4HU/IFO96D1J/FO2Z4HUIFO96D1J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7E/51GA/IFO96D1M/F7E51GAIFO96D1M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCO/1UEE/IFO96G35/FCO1UEEIFO96G35.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Assembling the Ladders"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Cut out and assemble the Pivot Piece template, ensuring that the check lines all measure 1\u201d.

Do the contours of the Pivot Piece follow the side rail? Does it look like the hole markers are centered over the dowels? Trim as needed (but make sure it REALLY is needed before you trim).

Slide some spacers (left wood from cutting out the Pivot Pieces) \u2013 one under the Pivot Piece and two under the side rail of the ladder.\nNow slide the short ladder between the two Pivot Pieces, adjusting so the side rail is parallel to the side of the Pivot Piece, and the top rails on each ladder are 5\u201d apart on center (i.e. from dowel center to dowel center, not dowel edge to dowel edge). Drill a hole with a 21/64 bit (11/32 will do if you have that instead) for the bolt through the ladder side rail and also through the pivot piece at the marked spot. Ease the drill bit in gently toward the end to avoid splintering on the Pivot Piece. (Stop when you feel air followed by concrete...)\nFlip the unit over and countersink the hole on the pivot piece side only (no need to countersink the side rail). Slip a bolt into the hole and install a locking nut. You want the locking nut to stop 1/16\u201d or so from the side rail so it holds the pieces firmly but doesn\u2019t restrict the swinging action. Now line up the second side of the short ladder in the same way that you did the first and make another bolt hole and install the second bolt.\nScrew Placement\nPlace the Triangle back on the floor in its \u2018braced\u2019 position and pick a point below the second rail *where you\u2019ll still hit the Pivot Piece when you drill through* and drill a hole with a 9/32 bit through the side rail and Pivot Piece. Exact placement is not critical as long as you go through the Pivot Piece at some point, but I put mine half way between the top two rails. Again, ease the bit in gently to avoid splintering on the Pivot Piece. If you do get splinters (as I did) you'll have to trim them with a chisel as you won't countersink this hole. Now take a 11/32 bit and enlarge the hole in the side rail to a depth of ~3/4\u201d to accommodate the tee nut. Exact depth is not critical but make it somewhere between the depth of the tee nut and the width of the side rail.

I will keep adding bits here and there when I notice they're missing but otherwise, if you have a decent know how then you should be fine with tis Instructable.\nThe reason I did this project was, firstly, because I had an XBox 360 which I didn't use much. Secondly, because the fans were way too loud so I needed an alternative cooling system. And thirdly, why not? It's true, the XBox 360 is outdated by 10 years now, and is in no way better than an average gaming PC. But it's something I did for my own learning experience, and again, why not?!\nSince I was in school I have wanted to water cool my PC, but I just never had the resources for it. At one point I did a homemade water block: YouTube Video - Homemade waterblock\nIt didn't look great but the overall concept was pretty simple and I made it for cheap. Best thing was it never leaked, although I didn't use it in my pc for a long time. I upgraded not long after and bought a maintenance free water-loop and now have a top spec PC with a maintenance free water cooler.\nAnyway moving on, I managed to buy an XSPC XBox 360 waterblock for cheap (less than \u00a315)! Otherwise, they are \u00a360, or they were the last time I checked. This was one of the reasons I chose to watercool the XBox 360, with the main reason being that the fans were way too loud. Also, it's the only thing I didn't mind getting messed up since I didn't really use it much (but I do now)! I had added the Talismoon Whisper fan, and another side fan but together, they were still too loud.\nFirstly, I wanted to have an open frame design which was inspired by this: MAXXPlanck V2 - Wall Mounted PC\nI cannot take credit for the originality of the wall-mounting style as it has been done before!\nFinal Product Video: LINK\nOverall Concept\nThe idea is to lay out all the parts in an open style and have the acrylic underneath to apply an edge-lit effect. Firstly you want to strip the XBox 360, so you can modify the parts later on such as the RF moduIe and the DVD drive cables. I started by gathering all the required parts, designing and checking fitting on Publisher (my favourite tool), and checking placement of parts. Once I was happy with that I marked them out on the wood then cut out the slots for the LED strips. Wrapped it all in carbon fibre, fixed the LED strips in. Then I cut the acrylic mounts, bevelled the edges, mounted them on, fixed the components on top. Then the control panel was created and all cables attached. Testing took place in between most steps to ensure no problems would arise later on. Final step was to connect the pipes and fill up the reservoir which was a bit more difficult than I thought it would have been!\nAttached is a Publisher file which contains my original design idea, and the board layout - where I need to cut holes etc. The control panel design is also there for your reference - feel free to modify as you wish!

Please don't hate me, but Google will show you a whole library of them!\nOnce you have the parts, you need to get the water pump, motherboard, radiator, DVD drive, and hard drive, and lay them out on the board to check the largest distance required. The wood I used was 60cm x 60cm, so when I was creating the design I aimed to work with this size and tried to make everything fit in. After doing this you will have a rough idea of your design, then you can continue to complete the design.\nYou can refer to my design if you want to copy it exactly, although it may need a bit of adjustment based on your parts and sizes. Always double check!\nOnce the design is complete, you can mark out where cables need to go in and out of a component, so you can route them behind the board for a neat look. You will be cutting out a rectangular hole for the cables such as the SATA HDD cable and power, the DVD drive, and also for the fans and pump since they are molex connectors. The wood I had cut was slightly small for the XBox power cable, so I didn't bother to hide the cable behind the board - instead it just hangs over the top but it's nothing major!\nOnce you have this confirmed and everything marked out, you are ready to cut it out. WAIT. Not ready just yet! Double check everything, because once you cut it out, it will be very hard to hide if it's in the wrong place or offset.\nNow you can cut it out ;)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWK/I7JA/IE181GZH/FWKI7JAIE181GZH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVU/R29H/IE181GZG/FVUR29HIE181GZG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8R/M8BS/IE181GZW/F8RM8BSIE181GZW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXN/T64U/IE181GZX/FXNT64UIE181GZX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Stripping the XBox 360 and Marking Out Components Placement"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "You need to cut the slots for the LED strips now, as this is the first step. I chose to have them go diagonally across the acrylic, so as to cover the most surface area which will hopefully give an evenly lit edge. The slots should be just a big larger than the individual strips so there is no tight fitting. I drilled large holes at each end of the slots that needed cutting out, and used a jigsaw to cut down the whole length. For the smaller holes, I used a smaller drill bit, and you can use a Dremel or sandpaper to smooth it out.\nOnce the slots have been cut, you want to wrap the whole thing in carbon fibre. Since it is a large piece, getting someone to help you may be a good idea. I started with the board facing up and out - I had a sheet of carbon fibre cut around 10cm larger than that board, lengthwise and widthwise, so I could wrap it around the 2\"x2\" and the edges. You want to firstly place the wrap on the front, working your way out and removing bubbles. Use of a heatgun will assist with stretching it around the edges and hopefully giving good adhesion. Once the front was applied properly and I was happy it was flat, I turned the frame on its front, then worked on the back around the edges and the frame. The 5th picture shows how I cut slits so I could wrap it neatly.\nOnce you have successfully applied the wrap, you need to cut inside the slots so the wrap can be stuck inside the slots, leaving space for the LED strips to shine through - simply cut a slit through the centre of the slot for almost the entire length, leaving approximately 5mm on each end - this is where you will cut a slit from the end of the middle slit to the corners, so you can press the wrap in using the heatgun. Repeat this for the other slots! Then you will be ready to connect the LED strips. I hope I explained that properly!\nI chose to individually cut each LED strip to the size of the appropriate slot but that required soldering 4 cables between each slot - if you want to save time you can simple run a whole length of the LED strip between all slots, so it's one long piece. This will certainly save you a couple of hours of time!

If you have access to a laser cutter or CNC, then that's fantastic! You will get precise, and perfect cuts. Unfortunately I did not have access to the former, so I scored where I needed to cut and then used a hacksaw with a 32TPI blade. The cuts were fairly straight!\nFor this I used 5mm acrylic since that is what I had - ideally you want to use 10mm acrylic as the bevelled edges will look much better!\nLay out the acrylic sheet and mark out ONE piece at a time, as you will lose some material when cutting, so if you mark everything out together and cut them together, the pieces will actually be a bit smaller than you wanted them to be. Using a metal ruler, score a few times along the line you would like to cut out then use the fine tooth hacksaw blade to cut along the score - the score should give you a good guideline. Repeat this for the remaining pieces.\nAfter having cut the pieces, you need to bevel them. I tried to use sandpaper first but I wasn't getting even results. So I resorted to using the router with a bevel cutter. I experimented with scrap acrylic, and figured the best adjustment. As you can see my DIY table router was held in place with some wood and clamps! Again if you have access to a table router then do use it! Run the edges against it to get an even cut across the whole length.\nTo do a DIY table router:\nChange the bit to the one shown in the picture. You will need two clamps like shown in the picture, and a piece of 2\"x2\". First you want to clamp the 2\"x2\" to the workbench, and then clamp the router to the 2\"x2\". Ensure that it does not move easily before you continue! I take no responsibility for any injury caused to you: you do this at your own risk. PLEASE wear safety goggles as the acrylic bits that fly off are hot, and sharp. Also I would recommend wearing ear protection as it is very loud.\nOnce you have done all the edges you can clean them up using fine sandpaper.\nThe next step is quite important to maximise the amount of light going through the acrylic to the edges. You need to place the acrylic pieces on the board with the LEDs turned on to a bright colour such as white or blue. When you are happy with the position of them relative to the board, draw a straight line tracing the LED strip on the acrylic. You will be cutting a 'V' slit on the underside of the acrylic so as to allow all the light to go through to the edges. Unfortunately I was unable to find a 'V' shaped router bit fine enough, so my lines came out rounded, reducing the amount of light going through.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIP/SL9H/IE181PC3/FIPSL9HIE181PC3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F23/XPSQ/IE181PC8/F23XPSQIE181PC8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNQ/TSKU/IE181PC6/FNQTSKUIE181PC6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F58/S099/IE181PC1/F58S099IE181PC1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP5/S04N/IE181PC7/FP5S04NIE181PC7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWM/4E3Y/IE181PBY/FWM4E3YIE181PBY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Cutting the Acrylic Backplates"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "I chose to wrap the HDD and the DVD drive in carbon fibre too, but you don't have to if you don't want to.

I was considering wrapping the HDD and DVD drive in red carbon fibre but figured it'd be too much.\nAttached is again, a Publisher file, which has a template for the HDD sticker - you print this out, and cut around a piece of carbon fibre so the sticker is the same shape as the label.\nThe DVD drive a bit tricky to wrap - I was left with a small crease in the centre, because the disc part rises up and has a bevelled edge sort of.

Luckily I was able to find some M3 bolts around 10mm long, so attaching the fans to the radiator was a simple process. The bolts were just long enough to tighten properly, but not touch the radiator fans.\nIt should be obvious but we want the the fans blowing down on the radiator so the fans should face outwards. A friend of mine said that having the fans pulling air would be more effective - I'm not sure how true this is but maybe someone can elaborate about this. To use this method you would need to drill some air intake holes through the acrylic backplate and the main backboard for the radiator.

We use very similar methods for most parts. The bolts go from the back, through the acrylic, and into the component. This means we remove the hard work of mounting the acrylic on the board, and then mounting the component on to the acrylic.\nSpecifically, for the radiator I simply used long bolts which were fitted from the back. Place the radiator on the acrylic as you would like it, and mark out the radiator mounting holes on the acrylic. Then you want to drill holes in the acrylic the same size as the bolts we'll be using (M3 x 25mm), and then place the acrylic on the backboard, mark out the holes for the bolts and drill through the backboard. The bolts were to secure the radiator, and the acrylic just sits in between so when you tighten the bolts it sits flush and flat. The bolts will come in from the back of the backboard, as the radiator has mounting holes at the back - the bolts simply screw into them. Be careful not to over tighten them and end up damaging the fins.\nFor the motherboard, we will be securing the metal backplate directly into the wood, and again the acrylic sits in between so you need to mark out the mounting holes on the acrylic and drill holes in the acrylic. But firstly you need to trim down the metal cage into a backplate. As you can see in the last 3 pictures, I marked out the line which I need to cut against, so I can remove the metal wall, leaving me with a flat metal backplate. This backplate is required for heatsinking the components at the bottom of the motherboard - the thermal pads should be touching this. When finally mounting the motherboard, you put the acrylic in between the metal backplate and the backboard, mark out the mounting holes and drill through the acrylic. You then want to line up the acrylic on the backboard, and drill the holes only a little bit into the backboard so the bolts can tighten into the wood when you secure the motherboard as well. Then the motherboard sits on top of the metal backplate and screws directly through the acrylic and into the wooden backboard.\nFor the hard drive, we use the same method - mark out the mounting holes on the acrylic, drill through the acrylic and then line it up on the backboard, and drill through the backboard. You then bolt into the bottom of the hard drive from the back of the board, using the appropriate size bolts (M3 x 25mm is what I used but I had to add some washers to remove some length so the hard drive would sit flush and tighten properly but not over tighten).\nAgain for the DVD drive, since I left the 4 posts on the DVD drive, I marked them out on the acrylic, drilled though the acrylic and then marked it out on the backboard. I then drilled smaller holes than the wood screws thorugh the backboard, and used slim wood screws to directly screw them in from the back into the 4 posts of the DVD drive. Again the acrylic sits in between the board and the DVD drive.\nThe reservoir was simply two screws for each mounting bracket - align the brackets where you want them to go and mark it out on the backboard, then use small wood screws to screw directly into the backboard.\nFinally the hardest one. I used the sticky anti-vibration pad to secure the pump to the acrylic however the acrylic itself, I screwed into the wood first. When doing this, you want to drill two holes through the middle area of the acrylic, countersink them so the wood screw is flush, and then apply the pad. I didn't trust the pad only, so I used the two rubber mounts that come with the pump, and as you can see in the picture, I just screwed them on outside the acrylic. Maybe I could have done it differently since there is overhang on the acrylic, but it was difficult to keep the rubber mounts in place before screwing them in. And I should have thought of this before!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLX/DXFX/IE181JIO/FLXDXFXIE181JIO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSP/SYYU/IE181J2S/FSPSYYUIE181J2S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7H/BE17/IE181JIZ/F7HBE17IE181JIZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXD/EIQJ/IE181J3D/FXDEIQJIE181J3D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVP/Y73T/IE181JJ8/FVPY73TIE181JJ8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJK/KVJV/IFO98XYS/FJKKVJVIFO98XYS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHL/JRUG/IFO98Y1S/FHLJRUGIFO98Y1S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWU/DYY5/IFO98Y0X/FWUDYY5IFO98Y0X.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Placing the Parts on the Acrylic and Mounting Them"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Since the XBox 360 motherboard will be placed further away from the other components than usual, we need to extend the cables. Once I had placed the components on the main backboard, I measured the lengths between the motherboard and the RF module, DVD drive SATA and power, and finally the hard drive SATA and power. I purchased a 50cm SATA cable for the DVD drive which was long enough to reach the motherboard, and simply bought a SATA and power extension for the hard drive. The DVD drive however, I was required to extend the cables individually, so I cut out 10 x 50cm lengths of black 24AWG cable (roughly same thickness as the DVD drive power cable individual wires). I then cut the connector in half and stripped both sides of the ends of the wires, and the newly cut wires as well. Then using the diagram, I soldered them accordingly.\nSATA and Power extension: LINK\nPLEASE NOTE: DO NOT GET THE PINOUTS INCORRECT OR YOU ARE ALMOST GUARANTEED TO FRY YOUR DRIVE. THIS HAS UNFORTUNATELY HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE AND IT'S A PAIN...\nFor the RF module, I unsoldered the connector and then soldered wires from the connector directly to the board.

Attached is the design for this power panel. You then want to determine the depth, which I believe I found to be around 7cm so cut two more side panels, screw or glue them on to the first piece of MDF to create a U shape. When mounting the control panel, you will screw the side panels from the back through the backboard, or you can glue it on to the front. I then wrapped it all in carbon fibre to match it with the rest of the project. Again, to aid with wrapping you want to use a heat gun especially since these holes are smaller and trickier.\nAs you can see in the first picture, I designed the player LEDs on Publisher, then printed them out and engraved the design on to small pieces of acrylic roughly 15mm x 15mm x 5mm thick. I then attached an SMD LED to the side of all the pieces which are all connected from the RF board's ring of light outputs. Please see the pinout for the RF board - I unsoldered the LEDs on the board and soldered the player LEDs to them. Instead of the ring of light, we now have 4 player LEDs which light up. Also the power LED is connected to the acrylic piece with my name on - when the XBox 360 powers up, my name lights up with red on the left side. When power is connected, the standby voltage lights up the right side of the acrylic. So when it is fully switched on, one side is red and the other is blue.\nWhen attaching these bits of acrylic to the control panel, I figured out where I want them placed and drilled small holes for the wires to go through. Then a dab of hot glue held them in place perfectly fine without ruining the look.\nThe eject, power and sync buttons were also extended directly from the motherboard and are now a momentary push switch. For this you can use a multimeter to check for continuity as you press the buttons so you can determine which two points to need to solder wires to connect to the new buttons.\nThe LCD is the control panel for the fans - it can individually control the 3 fans, and gives you their speed, and it can also show temperature but I didn't connect the temperature sensors. This was purchased from eBay, and it makes the control panel look a bit more like a real control panel. This has a molex power connector requiring 5V as well for the input which we will talk about in the next step.\nThe USB ports were extended from the motherboard to this control panel, using a simple 1m long USB A-male to A-female cable for each port. The RF module was glued to the back of the control panel so it is all hidden when the panel is mounted.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSX/OIX4/IE181J5Y/FSXOIX4IE181J5Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGW/NX7N/IE181J5G/FGWNX7NIE181J5G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUM/8AVR/IE181J56/FUM8AVRIE181J56.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F64/G0FG/IE181J67/F64G0FGIE181J67.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSS/3AZ9/IFPMLSWS/FSS3AZ9IFPMLSWS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9A/0MTX/IE181JOW/F9A0MTXIE181JOW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAP/X4CN/IE181J6T/FAPX4CNIE181J6T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXT/8F0C/IE181J6N/FXT8F0CIE181J6N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHH/IUU9/IE181J77/FHHIUU9IE181J77.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Working on the Control Panel"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "The LCD control panel required 5V as well as 12V to operate so I modified a molex plug to incorporate a 5V regulator - this was a very neat job I thought, since it just plugs into anywhere in the molex chain and provides 5V thereof.\nYou want the 12v to go into the input pin [1] of the 5V regulator (LM7805) and have the 5V output pin [3] go to the red cable on the molex connector. Between the input pin [1] and the middle ground pin [2], and the output pin [3] and middle pin [2], you want to put a capacitor - I can't remember what I used but I think I had 220uF (microfarads) on both. This is to smooth the voltage out. Please refer to the diagrams in the pictures. I would recommend attaching a heatsink to the voltage regulator as we don't want any issues later on.\nSo this 5v adapter should we call it, can be plugged into any molex connector since the output should go throughout the chain. From memory I think the power chain works like this:\nXBox 360 PSU --> Xbox 360 Motherboard\n12v Aux input --> LED strips --> Pump --> 5V adapter --> Fan controller\nI plugged the 5v adapter into the last molex connector, just where the fan controller connects. The adapter was able to provide 5V throughout the entire molex chain.\nFurthermore, I didn't want to have two separate mains power cables so I spliced the XBox 360 cable and another IEC kettle plug for the auxilliary 12V, and combined them into a single IEC kettle socket. This way, I only need one IEC kettle plug to power the entire system.You can also secure the XBox 360 PSU and the auxiliary PSU behind the backboard to hide them away, and also mount the IEC kettle socket at your desired location on the backboard so you only have to plug in the one cable.

As I mentioned before, the reservoir is simple to install - you get two mounting brackets with it, and they require one or two screws each. Mark the location of the brackets on the backboard, and use wood screws to fix them in. I used hose clips on almost all connections, except the compression fitting ones on the waterblock. Where I found the tubing difficult to push over the fitting, I used a lighter to heat it up and make it pliable and then it pushed over easily.\nDon't forgot to put the hose clip over the tubing before pushing the tubing on!\nFinally, I filled up the reservoir slowly, turning the pump on and off so it could fill up all the air gaps in the whole loop. I used WatercoolingUK's red thermochill coolant which also has antibacterial properties, and corrosion inhibitors. This was ideal because the waterblock is copper and the radiator is aluminium. I had to fill the reservoir slowly in many different positions, from flat to sideways to upside down - it was a real pain and the first time I filled a water loop.\nI checked for leaks by leaving it running for around 4 hours, and placed tissues around the connectors. There was a slight leak on the waterblock but I tighten the compression fitting a bit more and it was gone.

Some woods where taken from the territory (olive, waldnut, cherry, castanie). That allowed us to choose the direction of the cut and store the slices of wood in a dry and ventilated warehouse.\n-Handle\nThe handle is built respecting the exact dimensions of an acoustic violin and preserves the same references for the hand. It is usually made of oak, mogan, buche... The top has different forms depending on the kind of resonator it is built for. We particularly like the form of a crown pit. The total length is about 63cm. There is a reference attached to the left side of the handle to counterbalance the shoulder rest on the right side. Fingerboards preserve the original size and are usually made of padauk or olive. Generally we place a diamond shaped wood knot in the middle of the fingerboard. This peculiarity is typical of the olive wood.\n-Shoulder rest\nThe shoulder rest can be embedded between the handle and the string holder. It's a single piece designed to sit on the breast and the shoulder. One can extract it to reduce the lateral size of the violin during the transportation. Shoulder rests are extremely customizabile according to the posture of the violinst. They are designed/dimensioned to balance the total weight of the violin and to shift the center of mass towards the body to release the load on the left arm.\n-Resonator\nAt first, we have tried different kind of resonators made of bamboo segments, coconuts, pumpkins or more complex forms obtained by using wood slices.

I managed to remove most with a stanly knife and smoothed out the edges with a dremel.\n2. Keep on adding the battery into the cavity until it fits comfortably in the section.\n3. To hold the battery in place, I used the plastic rnod that came with the gun and slightly modified it so I could slip in in and out of the groove in the handle\nSecond idea - Cocking Section\n1. Most Nerf guns have a cocking section which you pull back to cock the gun. This can be a great place too store the battery.\n2. Unscrew the section and see iif t battery will fit. You might have to mod the inside a little in order for the battery to fit. in the gun I chose the battery fitted in perfectly.\nI kind of thought though that it would be a pain to have to undo the 4 screws each time I wanted to change the battery so I decided to use the 3rd option.\nThird idea - 9V Battery Case For Guitar\nI had one of these sitting around from another project and decided to use it.

The intake tube needs to be attached to the water container. This will need to be higher than the actual pump as it needs to be gravity fed into the pump.\n4. When adding the outlet section you'll need to have something attached to the end of the tube which forces the water to go through a small hole. This will give the water some distance the same as a normal water pistol. I used a small lid and pushed a nail through the top which when attached to the outlet, ensured the water came out in a thin stream.

I didn't want a set which mimicked traditional carved wood, I wanted shapes proud to be made of concrete.

I found 100 ball pit balls for just $6.50 including shipping -- though when I just checked to link here the price has gone up and they're now $13.50. Oh well. Still reasonable though, when you consider the amount of fun you'll have with them...\nLooking around the bottles at a deli I quickly found my king and queen: there is no shortage of feminine bottle shapes, but Pom makes a wonderful matronly queen. As for the king, when you turn many bottles upside down the bottom looks just like a crown. I chose \"Sparkling Ice\" because I liked the straight sides. The drink itself was not to my taste (though my teen liked it) but I did enjoy the 12 oz bottles of Pom (green tea & pomegranate pictured here, or a delicious coconut blend). It's a good thing too, because at close to $3/bottle the Queen was the most expensive piece.\nMy first thought for the rooks was a roll of toilet paper, but instead I used a plastic fluorescent tube cover I had lying around to avoid the interior marks of the cardboard tube. These required some preparation, which I will describe in step 3.\nSince all these molds get destroyed after one use, you'll need to collect at least one per piece.\nThe trickiest pieces were the knight and bishops. I couldn't find any ready-made cheap molds which felt right, so instead I drew some 3D shapes to match the general esthetics of the set.

They are formatted on US standard letter size paper, but you can print them on A4 as well.\nI first tried making these molds with card stock. They looked great, as you can see in the first 2 pictures, and, after being wrapped in duck tape, they could hold the concrete -- however the weight and moisture of the concrete distorted the mold which became a bit more rounded than I wanted. It was too fragile for me to really bang around to get rid of the bubbles, and even though the tabs were on the outside, the wet paper became soft, and the tabs became plainly visible in the final cast. Building a support structure with legos didn't help either, so instead I made the final mold with a sheet of styrene.\nStyrene is great: it's relatively cheap, you can print on it (though I didn't test that), it's easy to cut with an X-acto knife, and it held its shape beautifully for this application. After the first pour I was even able to clean up the mold and reuse it for the black pieces. Styrene's big problem is that it does not fold -- it just breaks. So when I prepared my molds I cut all the way through the styrene on the cut lines, then very gently, I cut only part way through the fold lines (on the mountain fold lines). While I slowly bent the sides I reinforced the folds with some packaging tape to keep them from breaking off. I also avoided folding any more than a 90\u00b0 angle -- that way I was able to keep the molds together and perfectly aligned.\nWhen the time came to take off the mold I just cut the tape along a few key edges and gently peeled the styrene shell open like a shrimp.\nNote for laser cutter contest: a laser cutter really would have come in handy for this step, allowing me to make completely rigid, reusable molds...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9Y/LK4V/IF7IVOXR/F9YLK4VIF7IVOXR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0Q/3G3S/IF7IVOYA/F0Q3G3SIF7IVOYA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRC/GYB3/IF7IVPJO/FRCGYB3IF7IVPJO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7I/OV0E/IF7IVQDN/F7IOV0EIF7IVQDN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2C/VOX3/IF7IVQDE/F2CVOX3IF7IVQDE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNO/QE66/IF7IVP2N/FNOQE66IF7IVP2N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F01/8NU8/IF7IVP2O/F018NU8IF7IVP2O.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Make the Bishop and Knight Mold"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Rooks\nI used the plastic cover of a fluorescent tube for the rooks, but toilet paper rolls would work just as well. You'll see the the mark from the roll, and the texture on the concrete's surface won't be so glossy, but if you attach a bottom and cover the whole thing with duck tape it should work just as well. Whether you are using paper or plastic, use plenty of tape to attach the bottom, you want the mold to be as watertight as possible. Even though it will hold your concrete, if water leaks out after you pour you will get little weak spots with a less attractive finish (see final picture).\nKing\nPrepare the king mold by cutting off the top of your bottle. You will use the bottom part to fashion the king. Since you'll want to fill your mold to the rim, cut a straight line around the bottle at your desired height for the king. My trick for doing this is to hold a pen at the correct height (using some sort of prop to hold it steady) then, on a flat surface, to turn the bottle all the way around -- then cut it along the line with a box cutter or a pair of sharp scissors.\nQueen\nA 12oz bottle of Pom juice makes a great queen; she's a little on the buxom, heavy side, but the bottle neck looks particularly crown-like, especially with the addition of a marble. To prepare the queen you just need to saw off the very top, right above the \"crown\" and below the screw cap area.\nPawns\nBall pit balls are very easy to cut; just make a small hole on one end, large enough to spoon in your concrete. Also keep an egg carton on hand to hold the balls after they've been filled with concrete.

You don't need anywhere that much for this project, but I wanted concrete for other experiments and projects too so I went whole hog. Big mistake. That thing's a bear to carry.\nThe second hardest thing was using and keeping my gloves on for the relatively fine work needed to fill these small molds -- but you REALLY need to use gloves, and if you're working inside, you REALLY need to wear a mask as well. Portland cement, the key ingredient of all forms of concrete (including stucco and grout) can be ground so fine that it can pass through a sieve which holds water... Mixed with water it turns hard as stone, plus it is so alkaline that it can burn your skin. Even minor contact will make your skin feel itchy and dry.\nStop a moment and imagine what happens inside your lungs when you breathe in that fine cloud of cement dust... then wear protection.\nBesides that, mixing concrete is very easy and enjoyable. Get a pre-mixed bag so you don't need to worry about getting the right proportions of portland cement and aggregates (sand and small gravel). Add just enough cold water so that all the cement is completely wet... then add a tiny bit more water to make the texture less clumpy and easier to pour. It will be harder to get all the bubbles out of a drier mix, but you don't want it to be too wet and runny either. Don't worry too much about getting it just exactly, precisely wet. You're not building a bridge, and mixes with varying degrees of moisture will give good results.\nStart with the white (i.e. plain cement) chess pieces. Get all your molds ready before mixing the concrete: the knights will need something to hold them up (I used plastic cups) and just to be safe I also supported the bishops. Mix the concrete in you bucket between each piece -- this will help prevent it from hardening before you're done, especially if you got a quick curing cement mix. As you're filling the mold shake it and gently bang it around to get rid of bubbles and to make sure the mold is completely filled. Even with clear bottles it's hard to see, so bang, shake and jiggle away. Once the mold is full to the brim, flatten the top with your trowel and lay it on a flat, level surface to dry. Unfortunately the table I was working on was NOT level, which is why my rooks look like miniature towers of Pisa -- nothing a grinder can't fix, but it's much easier if you get it right from the start.\nI decided I wanted my queen to have an extra jewel on her crown -- so after filling her up (more like stuffing her, actually, to be sure all those curves would be smooth and round) I topped her with a white marble. Don't worry if the marble gets dirty, that will come off. Just push it down firmly. When you bang the Queen a little after that to get rid of the final bubbles, the marble will sink to its final position.

Even fast setting mixes still take weeks to fully cure and reach their optimum strength. It is best to leave the pieces in their molds for as long as you can contain your curiosity or else bad things can happen. You piece might be set and hard to the touch after a few hours, but at this point it is still very fragile, it can crumble easily if you take off the mold. Also cement needs moisture to cure, so keeping the pieces inside your molds will prevent evaporation: it will cure faster and end up stronger. If you really can't help yourself, or if you want to re-use the bishop and knight molds to pour your black set, wait at least 24 hours, then be very careful and gentle. After you've removed the mold (don't tug, instead cut off the tape and gently peel it off) place the piece in a plastic bag, maybe add a moist paper towel (but don't let it touch the piece directly) tie a knot and leave it alone.\nThe pawns, being round, aren't as fragile as the bishop and knight, so they're safer to handle after 24 hours, but don't even THINK of touching the queen for at least 48 hours, longer if you can stand the wait. The problem with her isn't so much her shape, which is fairly solid, it's the fact that Pom bottles are much thicker and stronger than all the other molds I used. I didn't wait long enough to take off the black queen's plastic dress, and in the process of struggling with a knife, razor blade and pliers she got badly chipped.

The opposing sides won't be black and white, just two subtle shades of grey textures, which can be a nice option if it corresponds to your worldview. It also has the advantage of smoothing over some defects (specifically bubbles) though it won't completely hide unwanted bumps. Still, it looks kind of cool and ancient.\nIf you opt for the pigment, buy the stuff specifically designed for cement at a hardware store and follow the directions on the box. The pigment should be mixed first with your water, which will distribute it evenly.\nKeep in mind that concrete tends to become lighter over time -- but this goes for the plain concrete as well as the colored mix -- so even though these pieces won't look quite as glossy black and beautiful as they did fresh out of the mold, your black set will still be easy to differentiate from the plain concrete.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F4D/J1EJ/IF7IVP2I/F4DJ1EJIF7IVP2I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBE/5K35/IF7IQTPR/FBE5K35IF7IQTPR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F76/GPCD/IF7IWCQJ/F76GPCDIF7IWCQJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGC/VID2/IF7IVP24/FGCVID2IF7IVP24.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F57/5SFC/IF7IVP1Z/F575SFCIF7IVP1Z.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: The Dark Side"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "After they have cured you can grind and buff the pieces to your heart's content.

When you dilute one part Weldbond with 5 parts water it can be painted on concrete to seal it. It doesn't smell bad, it's easy to use, it will penetrate rough irregular surfaces, and the results were great even though I applied it before the cement was fully cured.

It's just plywood after all. To make it look better, I decided to add hardwood around it.

If the width of the strip is W and the side of the plywood board is L, cut the 4 strips to a length of L + 2W + a little bit just in case. The thickness should be a bit more than 5/8\" because we have to accommodate room for the cork pad.\nWith a mitre saw, cut the end of the 4 strips to a 45 degree angle. Place them around the plywood and make sure that the dimensions are right. If the angle is not right, attach the 4 strips together and sand them together until you reach a true 45 degree.\nOnce the angle is right, cut a slot on the inside of the strips. I used the table saw to cut them all at the same place. The blade thickness turned out to be 1/8\". I cut small triangles of plywood and fitted them in the slots.\nMake the same slot in the corners of the plywood. Assemble all the parts like on the photo.

Assemble the platforms by putting a middle layer on top of a bottom layer, and connecting the outer blue rods to the outside of the middle layer.

This is probably the most important part of the Instructable, and easily the most frustrating. When I was first figuring out the levitator, I spent easily a hour on this part. Also expect many pinched fingers and flying magnets! These things are incredibly strong. First, you should have 16 magnets. Separate them all into piles of two magnets. That should be 8 piles. Hint, if you are having trouble pulling the magnets apart, here is a tip. First, don't try to pull them straight apart. It doesn't work. They are too strong. What you have to do is slide them against each other. Another tip, keep the piles of magnets far apart. These things will literally fly through the air toward each other and pinch you pretty hard\nOnce you have them separated into your 8 piles, you will need to determine their polarity. To determine polarity, simply put the face of a magnet near the compass. Its that simple! If the face is a \"north\" facing polarity, the south pole of the compass will point toward it, and the north pole away. That's because opposites attract, and like repel. If it is \"south\" polarity, the north point of the compass will point toward it, and the south away. Mark which polarity the face of the magnet is. This is important. Once you are done with this, move on.

You are going to work against the laws of repellance and attraction, and win!\nFirst, retrieve your platforms from wherever you put them. Then grab one of your magnet pairs that you just finished marking. Next, choose a side of the magnet. North or South. The following step is very important. Now, decide whether the side you chose is going to be face up, or down. Remember which direction you chose. Lets say you chose to put South side down. Put a tip of the magnet into a notch of one of the white connectors (one of the ones with the white bridge overtop) and put the opposite tip in between the blue rods. Then \"break\" the bridge, and slide one of the white pieces with a green rod sticking out of it down all the way. The green rod should be covering the magnet. Now for the hard part. Take another magnet, and find the South side (still using my example), and orient it with South facing down. Next find the side opposite the magnet you just put in. Put the tip of the magnet into the blue rods, and push down so that the other corner is in the white connector slot. This should have been difficult to do, the magnets don't like this, the law of \"like repels like\" says so. It will probably take several tries. I found putting a rod down through the center hole will help keep the magnets from sticking to each other. When you have both sets down, push the other side of the white connector down, with green rod covering the magnet you just put in.\nNow for the last two sets. First, rotate the platform so the side without a bridge is facing you. The center connector should still be higher than the other pieces. Next, slide the corner of a magnet underneath that white connector, and place the other corner onto the connector slot on the other white connector. It should be holding itself in place by the magnetic forces, if it isn't, make sure the south side is facing down. Do the same with the other side. Again, this should take several tries. Now shove down on the white disk, and it will force the two magnets under it into position. BOOM!

I started looking around and was further inspired by this:\nI built something similar using Chameleon PI.\nSo given this success I started scouring around for broken 80's computers and game consoles. The game consoles are surprisingly rugged and the first few I bought I was able to fix so I onsold them! However I finally found one that had a case that was in very good condition but with a board that I could not get going. So this project was born!\nThere are many people doing similar things and initially I just wanted to stick a PI into the case and plug in some USB controllers. People in the past have done just that and have cut holes in the case for various reasons and pulled out the DB9 connectors and put in female USB connectors.\nHowever as I sat there looking at the case I started thinking could I do this a bit better. The case already has an opening on the bottom which is high enough to expose the four USB and ethernet ports if I mounted it just right. What about the original controllers could I interface those to the Pi somehow? I looked around the net and as far as I could tell people have done various parts of what I wanted to do but not the whole thing together. So maybe this will be a new take on this idea!\nMy goal is to have a Megadrive that from the outside looks unchanged from the original as far as possible (the only difference you can see is the power connector and the HDMI connector. When working it should work exactly as it did when new, the power LED will work and both controllers (including six button versions) will work seamlessly. Those controllers though will also work well with Retropie and the emulators. As a bonus you will be able to plug in a cartridge for aesthetic value (it wont actually work though!).", "title": "Sega MegaPi", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Sega-MegaPi/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Components:\nBroken Sega Megadrive 2\nRaspberry Pi 2\nArduino Pro Micro\nMale Female HDMI Cable\n90 Degree Male to Female USB\nFemale to Female Jumper Cables\nHeat Shrink Tubing\nVarious Colour Hook Up Wire\nPanel Mount DC Socket\nMicro USB to USB Cable\n19mm Cable Tie Mounts\n2x Micro Momentary Push Switches\n2x 10k Ohm Resistors\n2x 1k Ohm Resistors\n4mm perspex cut up as spacers\nTools:\nScrewdriver\nSoldering Iron\nDremel (or equivalent!)\nWire cutters\nDrill", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: What I Used"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The first part is easy.

I used some perpex I had to make spacers and glued them down before drilling holes and securing the Pi with screws.\nOnce that was in I reinstalled the cartridge slot (which was hard as to get off the board!) using the original spacers so it will be close to the original height (minus the thickness of the motherboard).\nNext I installed the panel socket which fit neatly into place.\nLastly for this phase I plugged in the HDMI cable. This was a snug fit given where I placed the PI and necessitated some close shaving of the section of motherboard which I retained for the DB9 connectors. On the female end of the connector I shaved 1-2mm off all the way around so it has a little step which will fit through the side of the case. Using a small file I gently cut the existing round hole out to make it rectangular and slipped the connector through so that it is flush with the outside of the case. I glued a small block of plastic under the connector for support and then used silicon to hold it in place.

I used the same colour for corresponding pins of each connector which sped up the process of attaching them all to the Arduino.\nIf you look closely at the right hand side you can see the HDMI cable is a tight fit. I had to remove a screw and cut back some of the board to get that all to work. It could not be any tighter but in the end came together perfectly.\nAlso I preserved the LED and ran power from a 5V GPIO pin and GND to the LED and the surface mounted resistor that is right beside it. Result is a power LED which works exactly like the original!\nAll eighteen wires then need to be soldered neatly to the Arduino Pro Micro. I used a cable tie mount to hold it in its final place.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTW/IC3G/I9YBVZJG/FTWIC3GI9YBVZJG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBA/G8Q2/IA0WD3Y6/FBAG8Q2IA0WD3Y6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: DB9 Connectors"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Upfront this is all the work of Jon Thysell. I have used his sketch for the Leonardo except I am using a Pro Micro.\nThis just worked out of the box without any problems. It is awesome! However I have tried it with the six button controllers you can buy on eBay at the moment and it does not work in six button mode. There is obviously some timing issue there. If you aren't fussed about the six buttons or you have different controllers to the cheap ones currently on offer then no problems (those eBay controllers are cheap - short cord, light weight, crappy button feel!)\nSoftware wise though it does seem to work great. Just load up the sketch and solder on the wires according to what is described in the sketch starting on line 43 although I modified it slightly as there is different pin numbering with the Micro:\n// Controller DB9 Pin to Button Flag Mappings\n// First column is the controller index, second column \n// is the Arduino pin that the controller's DB9 pin is\n// attached to \ninput inputMap[] = {   \n{ 0,  2,  UP,    UP,     Z    }, // P0 DB9 Pin 1   \n{ 0,  3,  DOWN,  DOWN,   Y    }, // P0 DB9 Pin 2   \n{ 0,  4,  ON,    LEFT,   X    }, // P0 DB9 Pin 3   \n{ 0,  5,  ON,    RIGHT,  MODE }, // P0 DB9 Pin 4  \n{ 0,  6,  A,     B,      0    }, // P0 DB9 Pin 6   \n{ 0,  7,  START, C,      0    }, // P0 DB9 Pin 9  \n{ 1,  A3, UP,    UP,     Z    }, // P1 DB9 Pin 1   \n{ 1,  A2, DOWN,  DOWN,   Y    }, // P1 DB9 Pin 2   \n{ 1,  A1, ON,    LEFT,   X    }, // P1 DB9 Pin 3   \n{ 1,  A0, ON,    RIGHT,  MODE }, // P1 DB9 Pin 4   \n{ 1,  15, A,     B,      0    }, // P1 DB9 Pin 6   \n{ 1,  14, START, C,      0    }  // P1 DB9 Pin 9 \n};\nYou also need to solder the remaining wires as follows:\nP0 and P1 DB9 Pin 5 to VCC\nP0 DB9 Pin 7 to Arduino Pin 8\nP1 DB9 Pin 7 to Arduino Pin 9 (See lines 31 and 32 of the sketch)\nP0 and P1 DB9 Pin 8 to GND\nDetails about the DB9 pin configuration is here.\nOnce you have this done then the Arduino appears as a keyboard and for each button press a particular keystroke is sent. The sketch supports 3 and 6 button controllers and does this automatically. It is probably better to use a 6 button controller as it then allows those extra buttons to be used when you are playing other emulators. The only button which is effectively missing is SELECT. However, I have used the RESET button to provide this functionality by adding the following code to the sketch:\nvoid readExtraButtons()\n{\n    buttonState1 = digitalRead(buttonPin1);\n    buttonState2 = digitalRead(buttonPin2);\n    \n    if (buttonState1 == LOW && buttonState1 != oldButtonState1) {\n      Keyboard.print('w');  // Could use this as a SELECT key\n      delayMicroseconds(1000);\n    }\n    oldButtonState1 = buttonState1;\n    \n    if (buttonState2 == LOW && buttonState2 != oldButtonState2) { // Cycle through six button modes\n       if (sixButtonMode[0] == false && sixButtonMode[1] == false)\n         sixButtonMode[0] = true;\n        else if (sixButtonMode[0] == true && sixButtonMode[1] == false) {\n          sixButtonMode[0] = false;\n          sixButtonMode[1] = true;\n        }\n        else if (sixButtonMode[0] == false && sixButtonMode[1] == true)\n          sixButtonMode[0] = true;\n         else {\n           sixButtonMode[0] = false;\n           sixButtonMode[1] = false;\n         }\n     Keyboard.print(sixButtonMode[0]);\n     Keyboard.println(sixButtonMode[1]);\n     } \n     oldButtonState2 = buttonState2;\n}\nThe long press cycles through six button mode which I added to try and help with the problems I was having trying to get the cheap eBay controller to work. You could omit that or use the long press to send a different key stroke. This function is called from loop()\nI did have some issues trying to figure out how to interface correctly with the emulator. Retropie itself needed very little tinkering to get it all up and running. The best guide for setting it up I found here. The issue I had though was that guide assumes you have USB controllers that appear to the PI as a Joystick/Joypad/Gamepad. In my case the controllers actually appear as a keyboard and there is very little information about setting up a keyboard to work with the game emulators. When I say very little I mean i couldn't find anything!\nIn the end I nutted it out by noticing that there was an example retroarch.cfg file which has a section titled KEYBOARD INPUT. By using that as a template and then referring to the button setup diagrams on the Retropie setup wiki I came up with the following initial lines for my own retroarch.cfg file:\n# For the Megadrive controller using keyboard outputs we need to know that the megadrive mapping\n# is odd. See <a href=\"https://github.com/petrockblog/RetroPie-Setup/wik...\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <a rel=\"nofollow\"> <a rel=\"nofollow\"> <a rel=\"nofollow\">  https://github.com/petrockblog/RetroPie-Setup/wik...>>>>\n# Controller A - Retroarch Y\n# Controller B - Retroarch B\n# Controller C - Retroarch A\n# Controller X - Retroarch Left Button\n# Controller Y - Retroarch X\n# Controller Z - Retroarch Right Button\n# Controller Start - Retroarch Start\n\ninput_player1_a = c\ninput_player1_b = x\ninput_player1_y = z\ninput_player1_x = s\ninput_player1_l = a\ninput_player1_r = d\ninput_player1_start = enter\ninput_player1_select = w\ninput_player1_up = up\ninput_player1_down = down\ninput_player1_left = left\ninput_player1_right = right\ninput_enable_hotkey = enter\ninput_exit_emulator = down\ninput_player2_a = n\ninput_player2_b = b\ninput_player2_y = v\ninput_player2_x = g\ninput_player2_l = f\ninput_player2_r = h\ninput_player2_start = t\ninput_player2_up = i\ninput_player2_down = k\ninput_player2_left = j\ninput_player2_right = l\nIt is possible, with this config file, to set up simultaneous button presses to do particular things. The most important is to setup a sequence to quit the game and go back to the emulator. In my case I press START and DOWN together (See the lines input_enable_hotkey and input_exit_emulator). This is key, as without setting that you would need a keyboard plugged in. Now once everything is setup the Megadrive can sit there looking like it did back in the 80s and be completely controlled by the Gamepad.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVO/QRGF/IA0WD1Y1/FVOQRGFIA0WD1Y1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIO/HYB5/I9YBWNXC/FIOHYB5I9YBWNXC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Arduino Sketch"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "I wanted to have the original case buttons work as well. Initially I though about a physical power button but then decided on making it a software shutdown command instead so that the corrupt SD card problem is minimised. (In fact I originally cut the board so that the original push button was still there and I was going to use that!)\nFirstly the hardware. You can get little momentary push buttons with a plastic shaft around the place. The ones I used I have had for ages. The advantage of the plastic shaft is that you can cut it off to the length you need. For the power switch the original square hole is just the right size for the thread of the button. I screwed it in to the point where is was just touching the original button. Some silicon sealed it in place. For the reset button I cut the shaft of the original Sega reset button back slightly. Then I drilled out the hole in the shaft that the button sits in slightly so that my button would screw into it. This held it sturdy so I left it at that.\nFor the wiring I went through a bunch of iterations to get it right. There are plenty of guides on how to wire up one button but not so many about multiple buttons. Finally I found this and and this and this:\nFrom all of that I wired up the two push buttons as shown in the diagram at the top. Also of interest I split the \"GPIO\" wire to go to both the Arduino pins 16 and 10 as well as the Raspberry PI pins. This is so I can use the buttons to be a keyboard press via the Arduino or do something directly on the Raspberry Pi (eg. send a shutdown command)\nFor the software I used the sketch from here. Just note the diagram on that page is for the 26 pin header. A good diagram for the 40 pin header I found here. A nice thing about this sketch is you effectively have four buttons, short press and long press for both the power and reset buttons.\nYou can see the addition to the Arduino sketch in STEP 4. For the Raspberry Pi the Python code I used is:\nimport RPi.GPIO as GPIO\nimport time\nimport uinput\nimport os\n\nGPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)\nGPIO.setup(23,GPIO.IN)\nGPIO.setup(24,GPIO.IN)\n\nbuttonPower_previous = 1\nbuttonPower_current = 1\npowerTimer= 0\nflag_powerPressed = 0\n\nbuttonReset_previous = 1\nbuttonReset_current = 1\nresetTimer= 0\nflag_resetPressed = 0\nwhile True:\n  buttonPower_current = GPIO.input(23);\n  flag_powerPressed = buttonPower_previous + buttonPower_current\n  buttonReset_current = GPIO.input(24);\n  flag_resetPressed = buttonReset_previous + buttonPower_current\n  \n  if (not(flag_powerPressed)):\n    powerTimer += 1\n  else:\n    powerTimer = 0\n\n  if (not(flag_resetPressed)):\n    resetTimer += 1\n  else:\n    resetTimer = 0\n\n  events = {\n         uinput.KEY_ESC, uinput.KEY_M\n                      }\n  device = uinput.Device(events)\n     \n  if (buttonPower_current and (not buttonPower_previous)):\n    device.emit(uinput.KEY_ESC, 1)\n    device.emit(uinput.KEY_ESC, 0)\n\n  if ((not flag_powerPressed) and  powerTimer >= 20):\n    os.system(\"sudo shutdown -h now\")\n    break;\n\n  if (buttonReset_current and (not buttonReset_previous)):\n    device.emit(uinput.KEY_M, 1)\n    device.emit(uinput.KEY_M, 0)\n\n  if ((not flag_resetPressed) and resetTimer >= 20):\n    os.system(\"sudo shutdown -r now\")\n    break;\n\n  buttonPower_previous = buttonPower_current\n  buttonReset_previous - buttonReset_current\n\n  time.sleep(0.03)\nYou will have to install the uinput module most likely if you want key presses to work. At this point I have it in the code but I am not using it as I found those presses were not being detected by the emulators. Hence why I have the dual config of using the arduino to do those. I have left the capability though in case I think of something in the future.\nAlso you will likely have to install the GPIO module as described here.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F46/QW7I/IAG4XJL2/F46QW7IIAG4XJL2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW7/1UXT/IAG4XJMO/FW71UXTIAG4XJMO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAY/I6KF/IAG4XJMP/FAYI6KFIAG4XJMP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0R/HN38/IAG4XPO1/F0RHN38IAG4XPO1.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Shutdown and Reset Buttons"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "So I think that describes everything you need to know!

One of the main reasons for the purchase was that I wanted to do stop motion animation. I bought a cheap digital camera and went to town. I started haunting the clearance rack at KB Toys looking for cool 12\" action figures and dolls to use in my animations. I developed an appreciation for the differences in the different lines. Soldiers of the World made historical military figures with a great deal of articulation. They could be manipulated into pretty realistic poses. Female dolls were another thing entirely. Since Barbie's main occupation has been to look pretty for so many years, she has remained a stiff mannequin with very little range of motion. My animations tended to be sausage fests because all the girl dolls looked hokey. Then my friend Joli gave me gymnast Barbie. She has knees and elbows that bend and hips that are more than just hinges. She had an articulated waist joint. She could do splits!\nI decided to use gymnast Barbie to create my first balloon costume. I removed the balloon from its package and removed the rubber band. I carefully flattened the balloon being careful not to mess up the pleats. I arranged it so there was four folds on either side and then cut the balloon in half with sharp scissors (my wife's hair shears- shhh). I used the side with the tube that inflates the balloon. I cut the tube off just above where the pleats started. This would be her skirt.\nI cut a small loop from the discarded inflation tube to make her bra. I just cut it straight across like a wide rubber band. I carefully stretched it over her legs and the skirt and arranged it around her chest. The rubber stretched across her decolletage to create a curved neckline along the top.\nSince I used a yellow balloon to make the skirt and top I decided to use a contrasting green balloon for the belt and mask. I simply cut a loop from the inflation tube of the green balloon and stretched it over her hips to create a belt at the top of her skirt. I cut another loop from the green balloon to make her mask. I stretched the loop over a piece of 1\" PVC pipe and wrapped it with blue masking tape. This will prevent the rubber from distorting or tearing when I cut it. I cut a small 'V' for her nose and two eye holes. I carefully removed the tape. I twisted her hair like a rope and carefully fed it through the stretched mask, arranging it carefully on her face and under her hair.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5M/M2WC/IDA2LJ5M/F5MM2WCIDA2LJ5M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2Y/4E8A/IDA2LJ5N/F2Y4E8AIDA2LJ5N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWD/FR9Z/IDA2LJ5W/FWDFR9ZIDA2LJ5W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTH/HIR1/IDA2LJ63/FTHHIR1IDA2LJ63.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKA/HP7K/IDA2LJ79/FKAHP7KIDA2LJ79.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ8/VY8A/IDA2LJ7A/FQ8VY8AIDA2LJ7A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNY/ON8Z/IDA2LJ7B/FNYON8ZIDA2LJ7B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTR/YQPE/IDA2LJ7F/FTRYQPEIDA2LJ7F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIR/CMQH/IDA2LJ7G/FIRCMQHIDA2LJ7G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLT/RC23/IDA2LJ7H/FLTRC23IDA2LJ7H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1G/LZYG/IDA2LJ7P/F1GLZYGIDA2LJ7P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEF/R5UB/IDA2LJ7W/FEFR5UBIDA2LJ7W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F07/ZIKK/IDA2LJ9U/F07ZIKKIDA2LJ9U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLJ/WD2R/IDA2LJ7Y/FLJWD2RIDA2LJ7Y.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Barbie's Costume"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Ahh, poor Shannon.

Since the rubber stretches and tends to stay in place on the doll's rubber skin I was able to shape her neckline and backline quite a bit to create the look of a tailored seam. I cut another skirt from the top of the yellow balloon and put it under the green dress as a crinoline. I made sure to align the pleats in the two skirts so the green would match to contours of the yellow and I let the crinoline hang out just a touch to add accent.\nOnce again I made a belt and mask out of the yellow inflation tube.

Like many American folk instruments, it's a product of poverty, cultural cross pollination and innovation. When the African slaves were brought to the Americas they carried nothing but their memories and traditions. One of these traditions was their music. In this new land they crafted instruments from whatever materials they could find or recycle. The music they created was based on the rhythmic tradition of their homeland, but it also freely incorporated melodic and structural forms from the European music of their captors. This new music called for new instruments.\nThe kalimba, or thumb piano, is an instrument from the western regions of Africa. In its simplest form, it consists of a small hand-held plank or gourd with thin metal tines attached across a wire bridge. The tines are of different lengths and are plucked with the thumbs to create notes. Traditionally, the kalimba is tuned to the players voice to accompany singing and is played in small, intimate settings.\nThe rhumba box is a kalimba on steroids. When the rhythmic African music met Latin musical traditions in the cane fields of Cuba, something amazing happened. African musicians suddenly had new influences and musical inspirations. While the terrible circumstances of slavery prohibited them from having guitars and pianos, they were able to adapt their traditional instruments to recreate these new sounds. The orderly keys of the piano resembled the tines of the kalimba so they started tuning it to European scales. While the kalimba was usually a solo instrument, the new music was played in ensembles so it had to become louder. They increased the size of the tines and attached them wooden boxes to create a resonator chamber. This soon evolved into the marimbula, a large kalimba tuned to a bass register to emulate a bass guitar (quatrobasso) or left hand of a piano player. Tines could be fashioned from metal strap, thin wood or shaved bamboo. resonators could be packing crates or other discarded boxes. With a few scraps of hardware and some simple tools anyone could build a musical instrument. Rhumba boxes combined with skin drums, cajons, claves, hand-carved guitars and woodwinds to create the roots of popular carribean music- from reggae to salsa.\nHere's how I made a bass rhumba box from stuff on my scrap pile.", "title": "Scrap Metal Rhumba Box", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Scrap-Metal-Rhumba-Box/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I cleaned out a garage for a lady a few years ago.

And with this shelving design, a small wall works great too. We started with 3 shelves to hold most of his favorite characters but this design can be expanded easily for future growth.\nThe shelves are 15 inches wide and constructed from 6 pieces cut from a 1\"x2\"x8' board.\nTaking 2 pieces and putting then into an \"L\" shape allowed for securing with screws in the bottom. Drilling pilot holes is good idea for this design and prevents cracking.\nMy wife then painted each one white to match the wall.\nFor the Lego strips I had to cut up a 10x10 base plate into two-peg wide sections. And since the shelves are 15\" wide, I only needed 1-1/2 strips per level. I used an x-acto knife for this task.\nWhen gluing, it is wise to hold the separate pieces together with a Lego block to get the correct spacing.\nI then found the studs in the wall, drilled some more pilot holes and attached each shelf with 2 screws.

However (and fortunately for my deadline) the CAD files I created for that process could easily be turned to a faster though less sexy process; 3d printing.\nThis still means the majority of the work was completed on the computer, with primarily sanding, painting, and some assembly done by \"hand.\" This made it possible to achieve the various curved shapes with a little less of the familiar round of sand, prime, spot putty, sand, lather rinse repeat.", "title": "Retro Raygun: Realizing a Prop Through CAD", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Retro-Raygun-realizing-a-prop-through-CAD/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The spec for this from the client was Atom Punk, Raygun Gothic, 50's-60's SF of the whimsical lean; Barbarella, The Jetsons. Except it wanted to have some grounding in reality; to be as fantastic as the rayguns of Forbidden Planet, but to have (to in fact share with those excellent props) the kinds of details and treatments of a real object.\nIt is not correct that form follows function. But the two are related, as are form and fabrication. Indeed, fabrication can follow design intent; real metal has a verit\u00e9 that resin casts may not. But, alas, we could not find any way to mix metal parts which would be suitable for lathing with wood furniture that could be CNC routed (or cut with scroll saw if need be).\nInstead, we narrowed over countless sketches into electric-drill like shapes and finally into the classic bulbous pistol shape, the \"dirigible body\" on a grip with rings around the business end. And a fin; the client loved the fin.\nThis also decided a novel and risky approach; to abandon the usual tools of clay sculpt and slush cast and to design the entire thing in CAD, to be realized by either subtractive (CNC milling) or additive (3d printing) techniques. It would be designed in the same clamshell sections as a real manufactured version might have, up to and including using bolts and screws to connect everything together.\nDesign-wise: the final shape was almost directly inspired by a very cartoony poster. But I'd already zeroed in on dirigible shape, boomerang curves for the grip, Cadillac/jet fighter fin, and of course insulator rings. All that really needed sketching and approval after that was the side swooshes, whether to put jewels or other markings on the power settings dial, and the grip lines of the hilt -- which was actually a happy accident, as I had originally drawn them true to the horizontal but accidentally modeled them orthogonal to the front edge of the grip instead.\nIt wanted to be basically metal...either brushed or chrome. And have some plastics and some pinks in the design as well, to fit both the period aesthetic and the retro atomic Tiki culture aesthetic as well.\nThat was actually the biggest design challenge; being both wild and grounded, having both a prop-like quality and a real item of technology quality.\nThe visible seams and fasteners, I did a design refresher by going down to Urban Ore (a local recycling place) and looking at old power tools.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNS/VZGS/IDIN8FDQ/FNSVZGSIDIN8FDQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTR/4JBU/IDIN8FCZ/FTR4JBUIDIN8FCZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ6/KS5K/IDIN8FD0/FZ6KS5KIDIN8FD0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Design by Iteration"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The time to iterate heavily is when the costs (in materials and time) are low.

I traced various pistol grips and used soup cans and other household objects to get a sense of the dimensions, and created a full-sized sketch. I then transferred that sketch to foam-core and cut it out.\nAnd it didn't look or feel right.\nSo second iteration; derived a new foam-core off the first, adjusting those dimensions which were necessary. This felt better in the hand. To make a full check, I glued white foam on to the foam core to give it dimension and sanded it into a semblance of the desired shape.\nPrimed and painted, it provided not just a visual sanity check on the massing, scale of details, grip comfort and so on, it also provided something to show the client and try out for scale and comfort in her hand.\nAnd it works quite well. The grip is odd; at first glance you would think you were supposed to choke up on it with the gun body resting against the meat of your hand. But it feels utterly natural to hold it lower on the curve, and when you do so, not only is the trigger in a comfortable position, but the \"sight\" (or whatever the design element on top of the fin represents) lines up with your vision in a way that assures you that the gun is aligned with the direction of your hand.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZO/CHPM/IDIN8J9O/FZOCHPMIDIN8J9O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMM/EFR1/IDIN8J4A/FMMEFR1IDIN8J4A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ4/S791/IDIN8J9B/FQ4S791IDIN8J9B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB2/X1AS/IDIN8KKB/FB2X1ASIDIN8KKB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Sizing, Proportions, and Mock-Up"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "With a full scale model, I could take dimensions directly from it.

You can even do this in a polygon modeler. CAD has certain advantages in approach, however. The methods in CAD are generally well-suited towards making holes for bolts, centering objects on each other, mating faces...and more technical tasks such as checking free play.

Which means I couldn't import standard screws.\nSo I purchased the exact hardware I intended to use, measured it carefully and modeled it myself.\nElectronics are always a tight fit. I have in my mind a project where I'll pick the components first, and design the shell around them. For this one, alas, I had an approved and iterated shell, and I had to adjust the parts somehow to all fit inside.\nAnother helpful technique for these moments is paper dolls; cut out exact scale shapes from paper and move them around on a fresh sheet of graph paper. It is faster than grabbing parts one by one in most 3d or CAD interfaces, and allows you to be more creative with what you try. And if you get a plausible fit, then you check it in the CAD.\nOne thing I had to check in more detail; I needed to see how the trigger felt as well as how it looked when it moved, so I built another mock-up in foam core and attached a trigger with the same spring and switch I intended to use.

The other is how they can be manufactured.\nTake the latter. The intent was to fabricate via CNC milling, This means that dead pockets are not possible. To make the potentiometer that sits behind the settings dial work, then, I have to cut two vertical pillars (vertical from the point of view of the milling machine), then add a separately machined part on top; a strap which screws down to those pillars and, in turn, has the potentiometer bolted to it.\nEven design for print has many issues of printability. A print service like Shapeways (where I've gone often, and where the majority of the parts for this ray gun were eventually manufactured) has on their materials pages various rules for minimum wall thickness, clearance holes, etc.\nPersonal 3d printers generally do not print supports in a separate material, so they have to be even more carefully considered in what kinds of overhangs can be safely printed.\nIn the case of CNC machining, the main constraint was not making pockets so deep the end mill couldn't reach. After that, it was avoiding as much as possible making sharp inside corners necessary, as those would require either more convoluted milling paths or extensive clean-up.\nRelated generally to this is materials strength and design tolerance; how thick do parts need to be for strength, how close will the fabrication process come to the desired dimension, how much play has to be allowed for in order that errors in machining or even small irregularities in surface prevent the parts from going together properly.\nThe other aspect touched on above is design for assembly. It is very easy to design a set of screws that can't be accessed after the part that they secure is in place! You have to really think through which assemblies go together first, in what order, in order that you can actually, you know, assemble it.\nI knew I'd assemble the electronics in place, so the primary order of assembly was that all the functional pieces attach to one side of the clamshell; meaning I could assemble the circuitry, test it, then close the shell up.\nI made nearly a hundred sketches trying to come up with the best way to approach the stack of parts on the front; originally the dish and nozzle were to be machined separately in order to achieve the best finish, assembled for final finishing, would trap the separately printed insulator rings, and the acrylic emitter would slide in from the front thus be easily removable for replacement if it got broken.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FP7/RNB7/IDIN8LN8/FP7RNB7IDIN8LN8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX2/ZWFK/IDIN8LN7/FX2ZWFKIDIN8LN7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6M/CWX8/IDK2K7DO/F6MCWX8IDK2K7DO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Design for Manufacturing"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "It would been possible to do the entire thing in aluminium. However, I didn't have the time. First off, the tighter the detail, the smaller the end mill for your finishing pass, and the smaller the mill, the longer the milling. Each part would have taken multiple hours each.\nAnd worse. As can be seen from the test mill above, like a 3d print, a contour milling operation will have stair-steps. You can get clever with the g-code in order to limit these to the unavoidable, but they are still there and need to be cleaned up. As well, inside corners and small pockets may remain that will take hand-work -- Dremel, files, sand paper -- to clean up.\nDon't be mistaken; those ridges on the first image are very small and come off easily with hand sanding with 220 grit. But it needs to be done, and it adds to the construction time. It also effects the final part dimensions, meaning you have to anticipate and adjust for that as well.\nAnd oh yes; the clever g-code I mentioned above means understanding some of the better software. I was unable to get Fusion 360 to spit out useable g-code during the time I had to work on this project, and what little milling I did for it was generated through the baby program Cut3d.\nA last little note.

Fortunately, most of the interior hardware works just fine with sheet metal screws driven directly into the print.\nThis is another advantage of a proper CAD; since all the hardware was present in the original file, all the holes could also be included. For CNC milling purposes they would have to be broken out to be done in their own operations, but for print purposes they can simply be printed in. And that means the holes are all straight and line up properly.\nI also discovered a few places where I hadn't problem-solved the CAD quite right. That required a certain amount of trimming the print, and gluing in a few extra bits here and there. But this was only a day's work.

But that felt wrong; what if you needed to remove the battery to take it on an airline or something? So I was seduced by the idea of a battery inside a machined or printed \"clip\" that would slide into the grip, and as of the files being sent off to Shapeways, the user would simply have to fish the cable out of a small hole and detach it.\nWell, that didn't work. When I had all the parts on the table, it swiftly became obvious you'd never be able to stuff the wire up behind the \"energy cell\" in its current design. So I modified; clipped the cable short, epoxied the JST to the top, epoxied the matching connector into the grip, and added an ejection spring to make it possible to extract the battery case.\nThat case being printed at TechShop, by the way, on a MakerBot using a reel of bright pink PLA.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9X/VU5B/IDIN8WB3/F9XVU5BIDIN8WB3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH6/2UBN/IDIN8W9U/FH62UBNIDIN8W9U.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Battery Change"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Paint wears.

Although I was concerned with how well it would hold, I went for Krylon Select for this project. On top of a black epoxy spray for strength. And the real trick for cleaning and sealing the Shapeways nylon print was to brush it with superglue before sanding and priming.\nIn the image above, left is chrome spray paint, middle is Rub 'n Buff, and right is natural aluminium (buffed with 0000 steel wool and corrosion inhibited with a light coat of sewing machine oil).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMD/HYEM/IDIN8YU7/FMDHYEMIDIN8YU7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Paint"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "The first thing to understand (besides the surprisingly small interior spaces I had to work with) is that human senses are roughly power law in their sensitivity.\nWhich is to say; if you want something to sound twice as loud, you need an audio package that will handle ten times the power. And that is why prop-makers have a lot of difficulty in achieving brighter lights and louder sounds than are present in your basic child's toy.\nYou can upgrade from the 60 milliamp LED most toy manufacturers will reach for with the kind of 3-7 watt LED that goes in high-end flashlights. That's within the range of what a good battery, a little basic thermal design, and simple current limiters can handle. And the rule of perception says that will look about twice as bright. To double that again...you need a proper driver circuit and a cooling fan.\nThe log scale for audio is similar; to get a sound that is perceived as twice as loud, you'd need to upgrade from an one-chip amplifier to large solid-state components with individual heat sinks; the footprint of the amplifier circuit doubles in every dimension in order to handle the necessary power. Which is why essentially all those consumer iPod speakers are about the same volume. Unless you get very clever -- which I tried but, in this prop, failed.\nThis prop had an even worse problem for sound; no sound holes. So my bright idea was to not even bother with a conventional speaker, but to couple a surface transducer directly to the shell of the prop. And I think this could work some day. Especially if I combine that with another bright idea; to create a prop with elements in the shape of a Helmholz cavity, and tune the sounds to that natural resonance. In any case, the shell ended up 3d printed and the sound is...underwhelming.\nThe surface transducer is vibration isolated from the rest of the gun, with the pusher plate placed firmly on a 1/8\" piece of machined aluminium that acts as a sound board. This in turn couples to the rest of the gun...but since the rest of the gun is sintered nylon, it doesn't vibrate well.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ5/LHEL/IDK2KARD/FQ5LHELIDK2KARD.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: Transducer"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "I backed up the emitter with a 5-watt \"pink\" LED.

The other functional element is the dial on the side, which turns a potentiometer with switch; the latter switching the main power on and off.\nThe trigger action itself is applied via a microprocessor. I rather dislike the feel of having light and sound directly connected to a switch so they go on while the trigger is being pulled and go off when it is released.

There was no space for another board. And the ATtiny was there anyhow, reading the trigger and selector dial and sending PWM to the LED drivers.\nIn fact, I leveraged a board I've been working on for this; it has an ATtiny84, an ICSP programming header, and four LC135 constant-current drivers. The latter are a cool little chip that will supply a regulated 350 milliamps to a high-power LED, will take PWM, and can be stacked (or, rather, run in parallel).\nThe board had to be heavily modified for this prop, of course.\nIt is relatively simple to do tones on an ATtiny. It will run (with some important caveats) the tone() library for Arduino. It is also capable of wavetable synthesis. The theory is simple enough. One of the on-board hardware timers is set up for analog voltage output; fix frequency, variable cut-off (PWM, basically). A second timer is used to generate a hardware interrupt. When the interrupt service routine is called, it picks up the next value from a wavetable and adjusts the set voltage output of the first timer.\nThis trick requires a couple of things. It requires the second timer be operating at the desired frequency X the length of the wavetable. It requires the first timer be running several orders faster (otherwise there will be funny aliasing going on). And it requires the program not spend a lot of cycles doing anything other than being ready for the next interrupt to be processed.\nThat latter proved difficult. I was running software PWM for the LED (there were no more hardware timers available on that chip), I had to take trigger readings and analog readings off the dial, and the kinds of sounds I wanted needed to evolve over time. So I gave up on the full wave table, and generated simple square or sawtooth waves. And that meant I could spare the program cycles to add or subtract numbers to the frequency (that is, the base rate as which changes are made to the requested analog output of timer1.)\nIt still meant that the sounds changed radically every time I put in a new \"If\" statement, and they were also strongly dependent on the base frequency chosen for the PWM. But with a fair amount of trial and error I was able to get some chirps, warbles, and clicks for the various shots and function sounds (power up, selector dial motion, etc.)\nIn fact, the aliasing and general \"grit\" was a benefit. Using similar techniques to the wavetable synthesis above one can make white or pink noise of various flavors, but that proved unnecessary. If I was using a faster and more powerful chip, such as found in an Arduino Nano, I would probably be digitally combining various wavetables and processing before sending that to the final analog output.\nAll the programming was nominally done in the Arduino IDE. To leverage the hardware timers in the way I had to, I was addressing them directly without the help of any Arduino libraries.

By making a lot of shallow passes I was able to mill down the acrylic rod to diameter on a metal lathe, but it flexed a lot in the process and cutting the nose shape proved impossible. So that was done by holding a file against the acrylic while spinning it in the lathe. Fortunately, a diffuse surface was what was wanted (to better show the light) so there was no need to go further than 400-grit paper in cleaning it up.\nYou can achieve optical clarity, but it requires wet-sanding to as high as 2000 grit in progressive stages, then acrylic buffing compound.\nThe donuts and the energy cell were printed at TechShop in pink PLA, cleaned up and gloss-coated without painting. The side details were also printed by me, but those got the same chrome paint at the other parts. This was part of the \"make it look real\" philosophy, as well as make it easier to sand flat the sides of the gun; instead of gluing then painting, they were intentionally done to have a visible seam between gun and flashes.\nA last-minute inspiration was to use a 1950's \"Atom\" motif, with a tiki head for a nucleus.

It also needed a holster for easier and more convenient display at a gathering. The inspiration was, among others, the clear holster worn by Wilma Deering on the 1970's Buck Rogers television series.\nClear vinyl and white pleather did not work by themselves. The ray gun simply has too many parts that stick out (like the dish on the front) and it catches on a soft holster. So I had to move to the standard; a hard-shell holster. Which, once the shell is made, can be covered in whatever way desired. I was able to stick with my original intent of transparent window just by revealing the underlying structure.\nFirst step was fitting. I made mock-ups with cardboard (and paper towels, when I thought a soft holster would still work). One of those mock-ups became the base of the real thing. Or rather, of the buck.\nThe key tool here was the vacuum forming machine. A handy tool in the kit of many prop makers, and one of the tools available at TechShop. A buck has to be solid enough to take the crush of 16 PSI, plus the touch of plastic heated near the melting point.\nThe buck in this case started with cardboard strips held together with duct tape. This was then filled with wadded-up cloth for stability and coated with Bondo. Several sanding steps and re-coat later, the buck was smooth enough and strong enough.\nThis is a very fast method. The major flaw is since you are working from the desired dimension out, the final item will be larger than desired. A better approach is to reinforce the outside of the reference shell (duct tape, pepakura, or whatever) then fill that with plaster (or better yet hydrocal, which does better in the vacuum forming machine). This makes you master closer to dimensional.\nIn any case, the holster shell was pulled in PETG. The curved side only; the flat body-facing side was cut out of scrap and the whole thing glued together.\nThen my Bernina 830 and I struggled for nearly two days to make a neat job of pulling white pleather around the thing. If time had been tighter, I would have just used hot glue. As it was, some of the stitches are decorative and hide a hot glue solution, but the fabric is actually seamed to make it drape around the form.\nThe final stage was to create padding for the inside.

The legs are removable, which makes this a great traveling table as well. In its complete form the top measures 10 by 20-inches and stands about 18.5-inches tall.\nI am using all 1-inch PVC for this build because my son will also be using this table as a mini desk. You should be able to use 3/4-inch PVC if you only plan to use it as a Lego table, but you may need to adjust the pipe lengths slightly.\n--------------------------------------------\nParts needed:\nPVC Pipes:\nFour 16-inch pipes\nFour 7.5-inch pipes\nThree 7-inch pipes\nPVC Connectors:\nFour Corners\nTwo T\u2019s\nOther Items:\nTwo 10x10 inch Lego Base plates or compatible\n10x20 inch piece of wood\nGlue\nDrill\nFlush mounting bolts and nuts\nThree large Lego bricks\n--------------------------------\nFirst lay out the parts to the frame. The front and back pipes are 7.5 inches and the connecting pipes are 7 inches. Assemble them securely and then add the legs. If you choose to add PVC cement, I do NOT suggest putting it on the legs.\nYou will also need a fairly thick piece of wood to provide additional support under the Lego base plates. I would suggest looking in the scrap wood piles at most hardwood stores. That is where I found this one for free. I cut the wood into a 10x20 inch rectangle to fit the top of the PVC. I then painted it with Eggshell white on the bottom and sides. I left the top of the wood unpainted so a layer of glue would adhere better.\nAfter the paint dried, a quick test fit was done to double check the sizes. Everything fit great. I then removed the legs for the next step.\nThe wood needs to be securely attached to the PVC, so I drilled a small hole at each corner into the PVC. Instead of screws, I got some flush mounting bolts and nuts at the local hardware store. You will need the bolts to be flush with the wood so the base plates will lay flat. I tightened the nuts snug but not overly tight because it is possible to crack the PVC. If the wood ever becomes loose, just retighten the nuts.\nI then glued the base plates to the top of the wood, but make sure to add a few Lego bricks connecting the two plates together so they are the correct distance apart. Now allow the glue to dry over night\nAnd there you have it: A great Lego table for home and travel.\nThis table can also work as a night stand next to your child\u2019s bed. And you can add a Lego border to keep stuff from falling off.\nOr your kids can use it as a mini desk for doing homework. There are so many ways to use this table that a child can keep it for years.\nIf you enjoyed this project, please click the LIKE button.\nYou may also want to check out these projects:\nPVC Soccer Goal\nHomemade Water Park\nLuke 6:48", "title": "Lego Table DIY With PVC", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Lego-Table-DIY-with-PVC/", "steps": [], "channel": "LEGO"}, {"category": "Play", "description": "Build your own penguin army using common office supplies.", "title": "Fast and Cheap Penguin Army", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Fast-and-Cheap-Penguin-Army/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "1.

The original hank drum is the creation of Dennis Havlena. Dennis is an awesome guy- he had a good idea and instead of starting a company, he started a movement. He shared his design freely and enabled a lot of folks to explore their creativity and make a little money if they choose.\nI also owe a debt of gratitude to Bart Hopkin for his book Musical Instrument Design. It's the go-to guide for anyone interested in making their own instruments.\nSo what's so different about this propane tank drum? There are already several designs floating around out there, like this one from Hermes or this one from -Moon (which isn't actually made from a propane tank, but it's an awesome example of the type of instrument I'll be making). Most of the tongue drums I've seen have the tongues cut in a way that they are attached near the outside of the top of the drum. This helps isolate the individual notes, as the sound waves are stopped somewhat by the bend in the metal at the edge. My drum is cut the other way around- the tongues are connected to the drum in the center of the top in an arrangement that resembles a flower. This does two things- it allows for sympathetic vibration in other tongues to create harmonics and more sustain and it allows for more tongues to be used. My drum has 7-11 different notes in a pentatonic blues scale. My drum is also cut down to an interesting UFO shape to make it a bit more portable and comfortable to play.\nI've tried to limit this project to use common simple tools. I'll give plenty of suggestions for alternatives, so you shouldn't have much trouble making your own. Specialty tools just make it a quicker job.", "title": "Build a Compact Propane Tank Tongue Drum", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-Compact-Propane-Tank-Tongue-Drum/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "This drum is made from a discarded propane tank. I buy tanks from the local welding supply shop as scrap metal. Tanks have to be hydro-statically tested periodically. If a tank is found to be unsafe or to have too much rust and pitting, it is unfit for use. They drain the residual propane and remove the valves. When I buy scrap tanks, the first thing I do is fill them up with soapy water and let them sit overnight. This insures that there is no residual gas left in the tank and it reduces the sulfur smell from the gas adulterants.\nAfter the tank is drained, rinsed and dried I can process it to make a drum. The first step is to remove the ring from the bottom and the handle from the top. The bottom ring is welded to the tank in three spots to create a stable base to sit on. It can be removed by gripping it with a pair of vice grips next to a weld and rocking the metal back and forth until it breaks. I did this for each weld to free the ring. This left some lumpy metal on the surface. I used an angle grinder to remove the rest of the weld and make the metal smooth.\nI flipped the tank over so that the handle was on top. The handle was welded in such a way that it could be easily cut with the angle grinder.

It used to be a big steel frame that held marine voltage inverters while they were being repaired. I got it from a shop that was going out of business. I decided to make it into a custom drum building jig. It allows a propane tank to be threaded onto a nipple and spun along its axis. It can also be locked in place with a pair of vice grips. This jig allows the tank to be spun while it's ground with the angle grinder. The spinning wheel of the grinder can be tilted to control the speed that the tank spins at. This removes all the paint from the tank and leaves a cool swirl pattern in the metal's surface.\nWarning!!!- I've been doing this for a long time. Using an angle grinder on a work piece that is also spinning at a high speed is incredibly dangerous and probably actually stupid. Don't do it this way unless you are absolutely sure of what you are doing.\nThe drum stand isn't necessary, it just makes it easier to work with.\nAfter grinding the 'bottom' of the tank I locked down the axle and ground the excess weld bead off of the top of the tank where the handle was. When the welds were ground smooth I spun the tank and ground the top to remove all the paint.\nIf you don't have a custom drum building jig laying around (What- you don't? What kind of monster are you?) you can always use a drill mounted wire wheel or even sandpaper to remove the paint. you can also leave the paint on the tank and paint over it later, although this affects the sound a bit. I want a drum with a metal finish so I removed all the paint from the ends of the tank.

In the key of C, 1-8 would be C, D#, F, G, A# C, D# and F and I, II and III would be C, F and G an octave lower than tongue 1. Also, these can be tuned as bass resonators that vibrate sympathetically with the smaller tongues. It's a bit trickier to tune, but it sounds really cool. To transpose the key you just have to make the tongues shorter or longer. We'll cover that later when we tune the drum.\nThe template has a hole in it's center. This is used to align the template with the center of the swirl pattern on the top of the tank. When the template was aligned and centered I taped it down firmly and traced each tongue. I labeled each tongue with its corresponding number to avoid confusion later.\nThe tongue marked 'I' has a 1\" square marked so you can print it out and make your own template if you want.

This allows the jig saw blade to slide in and complete the cut.\nWhen all the plunge cuts where done I used a jig saw to complete the initial tongue cuts. I modified the jigsaw blade by grinding the back side of the blade at an angle. This allows the blade to cut a tighter radius without too much friction. It reduces the life of the blade a bit as less metal means less heat dissipation, but it's a good trade-off. I inserted the jigsaw and cut each tongue towards the point where the cuts meet. I do this cut first. If I do it last the blade tends to bind when it finally breaks through and it bends the tongue. After the points were cut I cut each tongue in the other direction. I cut until just past the curve where the cut starts to straighten out.

Think of a xylophone. Each piece is a different width and length, and sometimes even the thickness varies. Each tongue on my template is a different size to handle the general width to length ratio. I've cut the tongues just enough to clear the curves with enough room to insert a hacksaw blade.\nTo begin pre-tuning the drum I started with tongue number 8, the highest pitch on the instrument. The bigger the tongue the more it will vibrate. This means that the smallest, highest pitched tongues will ring less than the bigger, lower ones. I start with the highest tongue because it's the most finicky- if I can get it to ring, the rest will be easy.\nAs I said before, there are many factors that affect the way the metal vibrates and what sound it makes. There is no set length dimension for the tongues because thickness, degree of pitting and metal composition all have an affect.\nI started by making gradual cuts on each side of the tongue with a hacksaw blade. I continued to cut, making the tongue longer, until it made a sustained ringing sound when I struck it. I used a guitar tuner to see what note it was producing and made a note of it.\nThis drum tunes to a pentatonic blues scale. If it was tuned to the key of C, the 8 smaller tongues would be C, D#, F, G, A#, C, D#, F. Now I have a choice to make. The three bass tongues can be tuned to C, F and G for a nice bass accent. They could also be cut long as resonators. Resonators are not 'played'. They vibrate at sympathetic frequencies to enhance the resonance and harmonic richness of the smaller tongues. Tuning resonators is a bit trickier than simply tuning three bass notes, but it makes for a really nice sound. I decided to tune these bass tongues as resonators, but for now I just tuned them as if they were bass notes. There are at least two more tunings, so we'll address the resonators later.\nIn this case the smallest tongue just started ringing at around F#, so a few cuts brought it down close to F. I worked backwards tuning each tongue close to it's note value in the key of C. As the lower pitched tongues got bigger they began to cause sympathetic vibrations in the other tongues. All this harmonic noise can make reading the pitch of an individual tongue kind of tricky. I use bamboo skewers sharpened like a wedge to dampen tongues I'm not currently tuning to make it easier. When it was kind of close to the scale and pitch I wanted I went back and retuned it even lower to G. By tuning it in steps things don't get out of hand and any problems become evident before they become disasters.\nThis is only the first tuning so it doesn't have to be precise. The main goal is to get the tongues into a proportional layout. This will make later tuning much easier. It's best to to the brunt of the tuning while the whole tank is still intact as it has a large resonant cavity making it louder.\nWhen the drum is brought to a reasonable facsimile of the key of G it's time to cut the ends off.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F62/QIOA/IDA2KQ6A/F62QIOAIDA2KQ6A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCP/RQ4A/IDA2KQ6G/FCPRQ4AIDA2KQ6G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNP/FRYC/IDA2KQ69/FNPFRYCIDA2KQ69.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH5/W5EO/IDA2KQ6E/FH5W5EOIDA2KQ6E.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Pre-tuning the Drum"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "I put the drum back in the rotating jig.

It's important that the bottom of the drum fits inside the top properly. If it's too smell it may interfere with the tongues and if it's too big the two parts will be hard to align.I traced out the cut line for the bottom of the drum.\nI locked the axle with a pair of Vice grips and used an angle grinder to cut off the top of the drum.

I tune my drums in steps- lowering each note gradually in turn rather than tuning each tongue and moving on to the next. Go slow and be cautious- it's a lot easier to lower the note than it is to raise it back up. If you do make a mistake and make a note too low you have two options- if it's not too low you can flip the drum over and carefully grind some metal from the underside of the tongue's tip (this is why I tune it before I connect the top and bottom).

I checked it with the tuner and all the notes were about a quarter step too high for the key of E. I carefully cut the tongues with a hacksaw blade until I had the notes E, G, A, B, D, E, G and A on the small tongues.\nAhh, the bass tongues. Honestly, tuning them to E, A and B one octave below the smaller tongues is much easier. If this is your first time building a tuned instrument, that would be your best bet. To create bass resonators I started by cutting them until they were about two octaves lower than the smaller tongues. At these lower frequencies it's harder to differentiate the primary pitch from the harmonics and overtones and the tuner becomes less useful. The resonators are best tuned by ear by hitting the smaller tongues and hearing the effect they have on the bass resonators. The smaller tongues will interact with the harmonics of the bass tongues and will often produce sympathetic vibrations that are different from the note they create when they are struck. Don't go by the numbers- go with what sounds good. There's a lot of leeway, and even 'badly' tuned resonators will give you some interesting overtones. If it sounds too cacophonous you can always tighten down the damper or add tape to the resonators until it's under control. Have fun and experiment.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMS/LL3P/IDECZOJT/FMSLL3PIDECZOJT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 13: Final Tuning"}, {"step": 14, "steps_text": "When the drum was tuned it was time to finish it to prevent rust. First, everything got a good wipe-down with alcohol to remove any grease and grime. I used some Tempo Marine engine paint to coat the bottom of the drum. This is a tough finish that will stand up to abrasion and wear. Next I misted the top of the drum with Rustoleum black paint and buffed it off with a rag. This leaves paint in all the scratches, pits and grooves for an aged look. It also highlights the edges of the tongues. I let that dry and then sprayed it with a heavy coat of Sculpt Nouveau Bronze patina stain. I let this dry for a few minutes and then wiped it off lightly with a solvent soaked rag. This left patches of pigment and more aging in the low spots. I let it dry again and then added a light coat of the bronze patina stain. I topped it with a thin coat of a matte clear coat to protect it.\nWhen adding any finish to the top of the drum it's very important to go as light as possible. Too much built-up paint will dull the sound of the drum. There are other alternatives for finishing a drum. I've rubbed wax on bare metal and even sprayed them with furniture wax. They can be spray painted or 'pickled' with chemical treatments. One of my favorites was wire brushed, allowed to rust a bit and then treated with phosphoric acid and sealed with varnish. It looks charred and ancient.

My malets are amde from a short length of dowel with a vinyl cap (from Rubbermaid- they're end caps for their line of white vinyl coated wire shelving) on one end. The other end had a rubber ball with a hole drilled in it glued on. As I said before, there's no good glue that I've found for these balls, so I dipped them in Performix Plastidip rubberized coating a couple of times. this gives the mallet a long lasting surface and secures the ball on the dowel.\nThis is the first drum that I've glued rather than welded. I'm impressed. The main reason I bought a welder was to make these drums- I could have just bought a few cases of J B Weld! This is also the first time I've used this damper design. I like it and will continue to use it.\nDon't get too bogged down in tuning. This is a folk instrument. It's designed for jamming on the sidewalk or around a campfire, not writing symphonies. Get it as close as you possibly can then go have fun with it and make the next one better. Learn from your mistakes and experiments. These are fun drums with a lot of room for modifications and innovations.This drum doesn't like hard surfaces. In order to resonate properly, it should be on a soft surface. Laps are the best, but you can set it on a pillow or rolled towel if you want to play it on a tabletop.\nI play with the drum sitting flat in my lap supported by my thighs. I put the resonator tongues closest to me with the small tongues arranged away from me. An ascending scale can be played with alternating left/right strokes and vice versa. Since this instrument is tuned to a scale already there are no wrong notes. If you're playing with another instrumentalist, as long as they play in the same key your drum is tuned to it will sound great.\nOf course you're not limited to just a pentatonic blues scale. My template is based on the ratios of the root note's frequency. Figure out the notes of your desired scale, google a note and frequency chart and come up with your own tuning.\nHave fun and make some racket!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDJ/K4XX/IDED21TQ/FDJK4XXIDED21TQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7Q/H3PB/IDED25AQ/F7QH3PBIDED25AQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN6/R19X/IDED25AP/FN6R19XIDED25AP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 15: Final Notes"}], "channel": "Music"}, {"category": "Play", "description": "My son has been obsessed with swords/shields lately.

For my key, I used a die-cast '68 COPO Camaro, but after reading through this Instructable you'll know how to adapt this build to any model that you prefer.\n------------------------------------\nWhat You'll Need:\nHot Wheel of your choice\nCar, Home, Locker or any other key\nPower Drill and Bit Set\nMetal Grinder (a grinding wheel, Dremel, file, or oscillating tool will do the trick)\nBench Vise (or similar)\nEpoxy (suitable for both metal and plastic use)\nSafety Gear (I won't mention it past this point, but ALWAYS use gloves and eye protection - especially when drilling or grinding into metal)", "title": "Hot Wheels Car Key", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Hot-Wheels-Car-Key/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "If you know Hot Wheels, you'll be aware that each model may have slight variances in design compared to others. But the first place that we'll start is a consistent feature in almost all Hot Wheels. The body is held together with two rivets which connect the metal body to the plastic undercarriage (and thus, everything in between). We'll need to remove these before safely disassembling the car.\nA bench vise (or similar means of securing your car during drilling) is crucial. I used some small pieces of fabric in between the teeth of the vise and the car to prevent scratching the paint off the body during this step. I recommend using a series of drill bits that are suited for drilling into metal. I found that 1/16\", 3/32\" and 5/32\" bits work best to remove these rivets without damaging the rest of the car and allowing for easy reassembly. The smallest bit helps to increase the size of the divot in the rivet head which ensures an easier time with the 3/32\" bit. It is with this bit that you'll spend the most time drilling. The goal here is to drill out the center of the rivet deeper than the edge of the plastic undercarriage. This will make your last step cleaner and easier. Finally, take the 5/32\" bit and drill slowly until you've removed the outer edge that remains of the rivet. Once you hit plastic, you should have a cleanly removed rivet that allows for a proper reassembly. Take a look at the pictures above for illustration.\nIt will be easy now to separate the four parts of the car.

After cutting away the bulk of the key head, you can use a file to smooth the edges of your work.\nLooking at the front of the car body, you'll be using this rivet to help attach the key to the frame.

This ended up making the base close to 30 pounds more heavy.\nKeep in mind that this whole project was off the top of my head and I did not give it to much forethought so I will make a list of all the stuff I should have done at the end.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQT/EDZ2/ID77NL5Q/FQTEDZ2ID77NL5Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE5/M3L0/ID77NKV8/FE5M3L0ID77NKV8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUR/SGY8/ID77NL2A/FURSGY8ID77NL2A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTG/SVBG/ID77NKLE/FTGSVBGID77NKLE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F19/JPXS/ID77NKOU/F19JPXSID77NKOU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCL/DJYC/ID77NM2K/FCLDJYCID77NM2K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDM/84H0/ID77NM6N/FDM84H0ID77NM6N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPN/O361/ID77NMRN/FPNO361ID77NMRN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAR/ZH31/ID77NMU2/FARZH31ID77NMU2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F48/1GUA/ID77NMPI/F481GUAID77NMPI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2I/R1DE/ID77NOPG/F2IR1DEID77NOPG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDB/N0UM/ID77NP3J/FDBN0UMID77NP3J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVT/1PC5/ID77NOZ5/FVT1PC5ID77NOZ5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZO/CNL9/ID77NP0T/FZOCNL9ID77NP0T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9Z/TYWO/ID77NP1W/F9ZTYWOID77NP1W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLJ/7RC6/ID77NP30/FLJ7RC6ID77NP30.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGL/CU96/ID77NP08/FGLCU96ID77NP08.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Base"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Like I said I would not call this a bow myself its more of a T shaped thing to hold the string but it works.\nI took a 2x4 and cut a grove in it for so the bolt had a guide.

The Thudstone is placed on the centre square of the board, where it remains for the entire game and may not be moved onto or through. The eight trolls are placed onto the eight squares adjacent to the Thudstone and the thirty-two dwarfs are placed so as to occupy all the perimeter spaces except for the four in the same horizontal or vertical line as the Thudstone.\nOne player takes control of the dwarfs, the other controls the trolls. The dwarfs move first.\nOn the dwarfs' turn, they may either move or hurl one dwarf:\nMove: any one dwarf is moved like a chess queen, any number of squares in any orthogonal or diagonal direction, but not onto or through any other piece, whether Thudstone, dwarf, or troll; or\nHurl: anywhere there is a straight (orthogonal or diagonal) line of adjacent dwarfs on the board, they may hurl the front dwarf in the direction continuing the line, as long as the space between the lead dwarf and the troll is less than the number of dwarfs in the line. This is different from a normal move in that the dwarf is permitted to land on a square containing a troll, in which case the troll is removed from the board and the dwarf takes his place. This may only be done if the endmost dwarf can land on a troll by moving in the direction of the line at most as many spaces as there are dwarfs in the line. Since a single dwarf is a line of one in any direction, a dwarf may always move one space to capture a troll on an immediately adjacent square.\nOn the trolls' turn, they may either move or shove one troll:\nMove: one troll is moved like a chess king, one square in any orthogonal or diagonal direction onto an empty square. After the troll has been moved, only a single dwarf on the eight squares adjacent to the moved troll may optionally be immediately captured and removed from the board, at the troll player's discretion; or\nShove: anywhere there is a straight (orthogonal or diagonal) line of adjacent trolls on the board, they may shove the endmost troll in the direction continuing the line, up to as many spaces as there are trolls in the line. As in a normal move, the troll may not land on an occupied square, and any (all) dwarfs in the eight squares adjacent to its final position may immediately be captured. Trolls may only make a shove if by doing so they capture at least one dwarf.\nThe battle is over when both players agree that no more captures can be made by continuing to play, or when one player has no more valid moves to make. At this point the players count score: the dwarfs score 1 point for each surviving dwarf, and the trolls score 4 for each remaining troll, with the difference being the 'final' score. The players should then swap sides to play another round, and the sum of their final scores for the two battles determines the overall victor.\nTactics\nThe basic overall strategy for the dwarfs to form a large group and for the trolls to try and stop them. It is normally better for the trolls to be widely spaced.\nA dwarf's strategy does widely depend on how the trolls are advancing on the dwarf block. A good tactic therefore is to be prepared to sacrifice a few dwarfs to get in the way and slow down any trolls that are advancing into dangerous positions.\nA troll's strategy can also vary but at the start of a match getting into shoving lines is regarded as the best tactic.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FG9/9DYF/ID5S6UFA/FG99DYFID5S6UFA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYH/IGPS/ID4CQFNC/FYHIGPSID4CQFNC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Playing the Game (original Rules)"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "This more recent set of rules has a different initial set-up and objectives, but is played with the same board and pieces.\n\nObjective\nFor the dwarfs to win they must move the rock to the far side of the valley - onto any of the five squares on the opposite side of the board against which the dwarf commander is sitting. For the trolls to win they must capture the rock by placing three trolls adjacent to it (in any direction including diagonally). If neither side can achieve their objective the game is drawn.\nMovement\nMovement is the same as Classic Thud except that Trolls may now move up to 3 spaces in any direction (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).\nDwarfs may move the Rock instead of moving a dwarf piece. It may move only one square in any direction. To be moved it must be next to a dwarf and it must also be next to a dwarf at the end of its move.\nCaptures\nA troll captures a dwarf by trampling over it. It moves in a straight line from a square next to the dwarf, through the square the dwarf is on and lands on the empty square immediately beyond. The trampled dwarf is removed from the board.\nSeveral captures may be made in one move and a change of direction is allowed between captures.\nDwarfs capture a troll by moving a dwarf so that the troll is trapped between two dwarfs in any straight line (including diagonally). The three pieces, two dwarfs and a troll, must all be in line.\nIf the dwarf that has been moved also traps another troll between itself and another dwarf, that troll is also captured\nCaptures are only made when the capturing side moves a piece.

Just use the settings you are comfortable with.\nPay attention to the joints. You want them to be as solid as possible.

Most printers tend to print undersized holes, so it's a good idea to calibrate the size of the holes printed by your printer before printing the whole thing. To calibrate, you'll need to compile the sources, so you'll need OpenSCAD and Python.\nIf you know your printer prints accurate sized holes or don't bother about tone accuracy, you can go ahead and print the STL's from thingiverse directly. Otherwise follow the following steps to calibrate.\nPrint the file \"calibration.stl\" using the slicing settings you'll use in the final print.\nMeasure the small lateral hole and the inner bore. The hole should be 6 mm in diameter, and the inner bore 16 mm. The outer diameter is 25 mm. If you get less than that, you need to compensate. For example, if you get 5.70 mm for the small hole (like in the picture) you need a compensation of 0.3 mm.\nUncompress the file \"source.zip\" in some place on your computer and open \"barroca.scad\" with OpenSCAD.\nChange the variable \"internal_compensation\" to whatever value you measured (in my example, 0.3).\nUncomment the line with \"calibration_piece()\" and compile a new calibration piece.\nPrint using the exact same slicer settings you used before.\nMeasure again. You should now get correct (or close to correct) measurements.\nIf you are wondering what the \"external_compensation\" variable is, it is intended for \"external\" features, such as the width of a cylinder. If you measure more (or less) than 25 mm in the cylinder width of the calibration piece, you should change this value as well, although I've found most printers are accurate for exterior perimeters.\nOnce you got the new calibration piece printed, you need to make a final adjustment. Open the file windway.py and change the variable \"internal_compensation\" to the value you obtained before. Save and execute the script. It should generate a new \"windway.scad\" file.

The end product didn't end up looking exactly like this, but that's probably because at the time I wasn't actually planning on building it. Once I made the decision I started doing my research on building guitars. I discovered that practically all of the measurements for a guitar depend on the dimensions of the parts involved. For instance, the distance between the bridge and the twelfth fret must be equal to the distance between the twelfth fret and the nut. Other considerations must be made depending on what kind of pickups, bridge, and other hardware you would like, and how you want certain things like ports and switches to be placed on the body. The first thing I had to do is find parts.\nCraigslist - the greatest junk store in the world\nIf you live in or near a large city, Craigslist is a great resource for finding crappy guitars that nobody wants. I found a cheap beginner's Ibanez, from which I got the pickups, internal circuitry, tuning pegs, and bridge for my guitar. I also used Craigslist to buy a Dremel for 40 bucks from the back of some guy's truck.\nBefore taking the guitar apart, I was sure to take lots of pictures to document exactly how the wires connect, since I would be disconnecting them and then trying to reconnect them in the final stage.\neBay - the second greatest junk store in the world\nI wasn't very happy with the shape of the neck on the Ibanez and wanted something a little more \"Sci-Fi\" looking. The neck I found on eBay is actually a blank. It's intended to have a large paddle shape that you can cut a design into to create your own unique silhouette. I liked the shape it came in, however, so I just kept it as this strange rectangular robotic shape.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FF9/GSUF/ICPP2BY3/FF9GSUFICPP2BY3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH8/NNMU/ICPP2758/FH8NNMUICPP2758.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4E/DIJV/ICPP276Q/F4EDIJVICPP276Q.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Step 1: Planning and Gathering Parts"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Now that I had the measurements (the most important being the neck length and the bridge type) I was ready to draw up my blueprints. I didn't end up following this exactly, but it was a great guide. If you're going to deviate, at least have something to deviate from. I removed the legs that I had originally imagined in my drawing because they seemed like they would just just get in the way, and I'm a fan of clean-lined, modern design.\nAs I said before, the distance between the 12th fret and the bridge needs to be the same as the distance between the 12th fret and the nut, which in my case was 12 1/4\". I had to allow for the fact that the bridge sat in the middle of a plate, so the edge of the plate is actually at the 11 1/2\" mark.\nThe placement of the pickups changed slightly from this. I placed them based on where I'm most likely to strum and placing the pickups near, but not directly underneath where my pick would land. This is a personal taste thing, and there are lots of practices when it comes to placing pickups - do your research!\nThe layout of the switch, nobs, and internal cavities changes slightly as well based on the size of the board and orientation of the switch.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FO2/9KZ9/ICPP2T02/FO29KZ9ICPP2T02.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Step 2: Blueprints"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Selecting wood\nOne of the challenges involved in creating an electric guitar is creating a solid body that still has a cavity you can place the inner circuitry in. Most manufactured guitars will have this cavity hidden behind a plastic door or underneath the pick guard. I though either of those things would interfere with the look of my guitar, so I opted to make my body in two parts, on part having a partial cut to create a pathway for wires to feed through to the pickups. This would also allow me to easily create the half-distance cut needed to place the neck.\nI wanted a type of wood that would be easy to work with, be nice and solid (not too spongy) and have a fine grain so it could convincingly look like a droid when I'm done. I didn't want to be able to see any grain in the final product. I settled for poplar, which is also not bad priced, for the quality.\nCut it out\nAfter making my marks, modified from the blueprints, I started drilling holes for the corners of the pickup cavities. Then I cut the major straight lines of the two body pieces with a table saw. I cut both pieces at the same time, to ensure that the shapes matched up perfectly. Using a jigsaw I cut out the rounded off \"head section, as well as holes for the pickups and neck on the top half, and the hole for the electronics on both halves.\nI also used a hole press to drill the holes straight down for the bridge assembly, which fastens the strings on the bottom of the guitar (not pictured). You can probably do this with a drill if you have a steady enough hand, or find a bridge that holds the strings on the top of the guitar and forgo this step altogether.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5I/TWHE/ICPP276V/F5ITWHEICPP276V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIS/0K7D/ICPP278C/FIS0K7DICPP278C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQI/KAWD/ICPP278E/FQIKAWDICPP278E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8S/34TW/ICPP279W/F8S34TWICPP279W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWS/RQ7R/ICPP279Z/FWSRQ7RICPP279Z.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Step 3: Cutting the Body"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Neck Screws\nBefore I went any further I wanted to make sure I had the neck sitting just right. If it's sitting just slightly to the left or right, it can mess up how the strings align with the frets and would be very obviously crooked. If it dipped up or down then the strings would either be uncomfortably high off the fret board or be too low and hit the frets while strumming. I bolted the neck in, drilling larger holes at the top for the heads of the screws, so that they sit flush or even below the level of the rest of the body.\nWire cavity\nUsing a hobby knife and a chisel, I chipped away a pathway from the electronics cavity to the pickups for the wires to run through. This was done on the side that would be joined with the top half of the body, so that in the final product it would be hidden from view. I also created some cavities for the bottom pieces of the pickups, which were sticking up too high. This could have probably been more easily done with a router, but I did not have access to one. A larger hole was also drilled from the outside of the body into the electronics cavity so that the guitar output port could be wired through.\nSwitch plate\nOn the top half of the guitar I used the hobby knife and chisel once more to create an inlay at the top of the electronics cavity. This allowed me to cut a small piece of high density fiberboard (You can also use a thin piece of wood) to sit flush with the body an conceal this cavity. Before moving on to the next step, I put everything together to make sure it was all fitting straight and proper. Only after I was absolutely sure did I glue the two halve of the body together with some wood glue.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F4E/S1JO/ICPP27BG/F4ES1JOICPP27BG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAJ/EP53/ICPP27BH/FAJEP53ICPP27BH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT9/0F13/ICPP27CX/FT90F13ICPP27CX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ7/ORJF/ICPP27EK/FJ7ORJFICPP27EK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9G/V3TT/ICPP27G0/F9GV3TTICPP27G0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Step 4: Cutting Cavities"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Prepping\nThe first thing I did in the painting process was make sure that the shape was as concealed as possible. I didn't want wood grain, or seams, or tiny imperfections in my cuts. I went over the whole guitar thoroughly with a thin layer of fiberglass putty, filling in any cracks or seams. I applied several coats (4 total) of primer, sanding with high-grit sandpaper in between each coat, before finally getting the desired smoothness.\nBase Coat\nThe first layer of paint was an opportunity to make things even smoother. I applied several coats of the egg shell white color, again, sanding in between each coat with high grit sandpaper. After a few coats of this, I taped off the top section and painted it with the aluminum spray paint. I've always favored aluminum to silver or chrome, simply because it dries evenly every time and never seems to give me any trouble.\nFor the blue sections, I taped off the sections I wanted to preserve with some masking tape. To make things really confusing in the photo, I used blue masking tape and blue plastic to mask off the parts I didn't want to be blue :P\nDetailing\nThis, for me, was the fun part. There's really no trick in doing this, and it theory I could have painted the entire guitar using just this method, but I'm glad I got the large blocks of color in beforehand.

I made my marks of where each needed to be cut, and used my Dremel to gently and slowly cut out the desired shape. The rough edges were later beveled, by hand, with the Dremel and sanded down to create a smooth barrier from picks, belt buckles - everything.\nI also used the Dremel to cut the holes for the various screws used to hold the sheets in place. DO NOT use a screwdriver for this. Acrylic is very scratch resistant, but not particularly shatter resistant and will crack if you try to drill it.\nIn order to make the wiring inside accessible for future repairs/upgrades, I kept the back of the guitar open.

Because of it's shape, GuitarToo-D2 is really hard to play sitting down, and because the body ends well before the 12th fret (a typical guitar's point of balance) it's very neck-heavy. To rectify this, I placed the left strap hang on the back of the neck, instead of at the end of the body like most guitars have it. This allows for the guitar to sit still when you let go, rather than crashing to the ground.\nFinishing touches\nIn the end was a lot of connecting the fixtures, such as the bridge assembly, the plate that holds the output jack, knobs and tuning pegs. I made some changes in the final stages of the project, upgrading the knobs, pickups, and tuning pegs from the ones harvested off of the crappy Ibanez to one's found online. I also added copper tape (you can find this in the garden section at most hardware stores, it's made for keeping snails off of things) to the inside cavity to reduce electrical interference.

Our intention was to provide an example of how an outdoor ping pong table can stimulate play and community, especially if the paddles and balls are accessible and free to the public. We were inspired by the public tables that grace many plazas in Barcelona and Berlin and we wanted to demonstrate why San Francisco and other Bay Area localities should be adding ping pong tables to our streets, plazas and parks.\nAnother goal entailed using the table as an art canvas, which allowed local artists to design a piece that resonated with the community. As a work of art making a positive political statement, the public respected it and the paddles and balls were left for all to use.\nThere are plenty of ways to build an outdoor ping pong table, from concrete to wood to metal, but we chose this method for its costliness, durability and artistic beauty. Concrete tables are what most municipalities would use for their parks and they cost anywhere from 4 to 8 grand. We estimate the cost of all the materials to be about $900. Most of the photos you see here are from the table's placement on Market street, near 6th street, as part of the Market Street Prototyping Festival held in early April of 2015.", "title": "The People's Table: Outdoor Public Ping Pong", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Peoples-Table-Outdoor-Public-Ping-Pong/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "- 2 Plywood boards for the table top ( 5 ft x 4.5 ft) Refurbished ping pong table can be taken apart and deconstructed so that the two boards can be repainted.\n- ChalkBoard Paint, paint for primer, other paints, brushes and rollers\n- Primer\n- Wood: (2) 2' X 4' X 10'; (2) 2' X 4' X 5' This is for building the frame that attaches to the cylinders and on which the 5 x 4.5 sheets of plywood will rest.\n- Plywood Sheet 10 feet x 5 feet, 1 inch\n- 6 - 8 sandbags. 3- 4 for each cylinder\n- screws\n- 2 sheet metal cylinders and tops\n- 3 gallons of Clear Pour-On, the kind used for bartops\n- Local Artists\n- Ping pong balls and paddles.

We placed yoga mats under the cylinder to prevent any slippage. The major concerns was the threat of the ball going into the street, and the wind that picked up every afternoon, making play difficult. Ideally, tables like these would be set in a protected plaza where there are walls to protect against wind and runaway balls. But we learned that we could also install small seating areas and even planters that could provide a barrier as well as a place to gather and watch. Plus, the visibility from having the table directly on Market street was fantastic.\nOur team\u2019s desire to build outdoor ping pong tables stemmed from growing up in San Francisco, and enjoying free and low cost public activities. We experienced the ups and downs of Market Street first hand and donated our time and energy with the hope of contributing to a better and more inclusive Market Street. Most importantly, we wanted to do this in a way that avoided and even mitigated the gentrification and displacement that has become part of every long term San Franciscan\u2019s reality. Instead, we would like to see projects that help the existing population not only cope with the vast changes currently taking place, but also increase community enjoyment of our neighborhoods. With that goal in mind, we came up with the idea to combine public ping pong tables and art so that the tables were not only functional, but also beautiful. And from that intention THE PEOPLE\u2019S TABLE was born.\nOur experience at the MSPF validated this vision more than we could have imagined. Throughout the festival, people played with each other, both as individuals and groups. We witnessed a grown man break down into tears after a game inspired a conversation in which he was able to talk about the death of his mother while also grieving the loss of his old neighborhood. For locals, the games inevitably led to conversation and stories of growing up in the city and playing ping pong in different places - from basements to offices to prisons. For transplants and tourists, The People\u2019s Table provided a fun way to interact with strangers. Middle aged men in suits played against young adults in baggy urban clothes. Homeless people played against tourists. Tech workers played against community organizers. Cops played against some of the youth with whom they have had constant run-ins. And even those who did not play appreciated a beautiful piece of art that blessed their walking path. Overall, it brought together people from different walks of life who may never have spoken to each other, let alone engage in a game of ping pong.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8B/B5UD/IBFSKZDM/F8BB5UDIBFSKZDM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ6/VK5D/IBFSKYNZ/FJ6VK5DIBFSKYNZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSI/ZYQX/IBFSKYPT/FSIZYQXIBFSKYPT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKI/X7W4/IBFSKZA9/FKIX7W4IBFSKZA9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0D/PADJ/IBFSKZGW/F0DPADJIBFSKZGW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2U/MBGM/IBFSKYO2/F2UMBGMIBFSKYO2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBS/NPIH/IBFSKZBV/FBSNPIHIBFSKZBV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Step 5: Installation and Public Use"}], "channel": "Sports"}, {"category": "Play", "description": "In 2006 my son and I each built a skiff /sailboat from plans by Iain Oughtred a great father and son project.\nunfortunately that fall while on the trailer in the back yard a large tree limb fell on my sons boat taking out most of one side.

Download and run my latest Raspberry Jam Mod .exe installer for Windows (you need the scripts included in 0.41). Install all the options. (Potentially, Windows will give you some kind of a warning about a file that hasn't been downloaded very often. You can either trust me, or you can download all the zip packages and install manually if you prefer.)\nIf you prefer to install manually than with the .exe installer, or you're installing on Linux or OS X, install the appropriate Minecraft Forge for 1.8 installer, download RaspberryJamMod.jar and python2-scripts.zip, put RaspberryJamMod.jar in the mods folder of your .minecraft folder, and put the mcpipy folder from python2-scripts.zip file in the .minecraft folder as well.\nTo test the installation, switch to the Forge profile that the Forge installer will create, start Minecraft, create a single-player world and type\n/py render 1701d 100\nIf all goes well, a big USS Enterprise 1701D will be drawn. Other models that are preset in the mod besides 1701d are ds9 (a giant Deep Space 9 station), bop (a Klingon Bird of Prey), jemcruiser (a Jem'hadar Cruiser), neghvar (a Klingon flagship), and, on the Star Wars side, stardestroyer, yt-1300 and atat.\nNote: Unless you have an empty flat world, the drawing may take a very long time and look like it's hanging. Be patient. It might even be 20 minutes: this is a very large and complex model.\nTechnically, what happens is that any Python scripts in the %appdata%\\.minecraft\\mcpipy directory can be executed with a /py command.

For Star Wars, as well as Star Trek, an excellent source is scifi3d.com.\nThe render.py script included with Raspberry Jam Mod (based on code by Martin O'Hanlon and myself) handles meshes in two different formats: .OBJ and .3DS. Other meshes will need to be converted. Two useful open source tools for converting various formats of meshes are Wings3D and MeshLab (just import the mesh from the format it's in and then export to .OBJ). If you own a copy of 3DS Max or qualify for their three year educational license, this will let you convert .MAX files as well as a number of other formats. Make sure you obey all the copyright restrictions on the file (and note that because Star Wars and Star Trek are under copyright, you are responsible for ensuring that your use obeys your local copyright laws; in particular, commercial use is unlikely to be acceptable without express permission from Lucasfilm or Paramount).\nTo extract the meshes from trekmeshes.ch, you'll need unrar. The meshes from scifi3d.com just need to be unzipped.\nOnce you have your .OBJ or .3DS mesh, put it in the models folder of the mcpipy folder (with all the python scripts) in your .minecraft folder (%appdata%\\.minecraft\\mcpipy\\models on Windows).\nFinally, if you're a Space Janitors supporter, you should have lovely meshes of craft in your Janitor's Locker.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKJ/NHWH/ICFKM0KJ/FKJNHWHICFKM0KJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Get and Convert Meshes"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "For my example, I'll assume that you've downloaded the r2d2.3ds mesh from scifi3d.com, extracted it from its zip file and put it in your .minecraft\\mcpipy\\models folder.\nThen in Minecraft (I recommend a creative superflat world, but in my screenshot I did it in survival) type\n/py render r2d2\n(No extension on r2d2.)

For instance, you do /py render r2d2 50 for a more manageable R2D2, and you can have him point 45 degrees clockwise of his normal pointing with /py render r2d2 50 45.\nYour initial rendering will probably be disappointing.

With R2D2, I was lucky and that worked just fine. (You can also do other adjustments with the roll/pitch/yaw lines.)\nComments start with #, and everything after the \"end\" line is ignored. I recommend changing the credits line to give credit to the mesh author and the site you downloaded from and including any detailed copyright information after the end.\nThen edit the blocks used for the materials in the mesh. Many meshes are divided into materials, and render.py will put a list of all the materials in your file after the \"materials\" line. Also, before the \"materials\" line you can set the default material for otherwise unspecified areas.\nThe most basic way to specify a material is this:\nmaterialname XX\nor\nmaterialname XX YY\nwhere XX is the Minecraft block ID and YY is the meta data (or subtype). You can look up the numbers here. For instance, to make the default material be polished diorite, you can change the \"default STONE\" line to:\ndefault 1 4\nBecause it's hard to remember lots of numbers, you can also specify many materials by a name defined by the Minecraft python API (as extended by Raspberry Jam Mod). These are all in capitals, e.g., STAINED_GLASS_BLUE.

The most obvious problem is that the glowing windows don't go all around the saucer section. To fix these problems, you need to specify the order in which the materials are drawn.\nIn the initial control file, there was a commented out line:\n#order material position\nYou can replace this line by a list of materials you want to modify the drawing order for.

I also found that the stuff made out of \"entdnacelle\" material got drawn later, overwriting stuff that was supposed to be on the outside.

A lot of people use kettlebells for fitness training. They are excellent tools for developing strength, power, stability and stamina, as well as overall health. Proper warm-up prior to an exercise session can increase power and mobility, and reduce the risk of injury.\nDisclaimer\nThis instructable is for advice only. It should not be construed as a suitable substitute for one-on-one coaching or for common sense. I am not a workout physiologist, kinesiologist or strength and conditioning coach. I am not certified in any way to teach kettlebell. I have been kettlebelling for over six years without injury, and I worked as a Special Forces Medic for three years. I have incorporated my knowledge of anatomy and physiology into my kettlebell practice, to prevent injuries, and this instructable is simply to share what has worked for me.\nBy its very nature, kettlebell exercise involves some risk of injury. The kettlebell is a heavy piece of metal and most kettlebell movements involve accelerating it and then decelerating it rapidly. If you pick up a kettlebell you accept responsibility for all actions and consequences with that kettlebell. I assume that you have some basic understanding of how to grip the kettlebell, how to squat, and how to swing. I assume that you have an awareness of your own fitness level and will exercise the common sense to tailor any workouts accordingly.\nI also bear no responsibility for brain damage suffered as a result of the terrible music in these videos. I don't get to decide what music is played at the gym.\nWhat you will need:\nA Kettlebell: It should be heavy enough to provide resistance when you lift it, but light enough for you to hold it over your head safely.\nRoom to Swing: An open area with a flat surface, generally free of obstacles. The surface should be somewhat forgiving, but not soft. Dirt, packed sand, rubber floor matting, and lawn work well. Concrete and wrestling mats do not.\nSuitable footwear: Shoes should be stable with flat soles. Cushioned soles do not work well as your feet may shift during dynamic movements. My preference is to kettlebell barefoot or using minimalist footwear. Do not wear steel toed boots. They will not significantly protect your foot if you drop the kettlebell on it, and they will slow your feet down if you have to bail the kettlebell and get your feet out of the way.\nWorkout clothes: should be loose and provide ample movement in the hips. Cargo shorts or fatigue pants work well.\nOptional: Music of your choice.", "title": "How to Warm Up for a Kettlebell Workout", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Warm-Up-for-a-Kettlebell-Workout/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Background\nThe reason why I use a dynamic warm-up rather than static stretching to prepare for kettlebell is that the kettlebell is a dynamic exercise. As stated above, moving the kettlebell involves accelerating it and decelerating it through space. The force of the kettlebell's inertia is directly translated into force on the body, especially the shoulder and the lower back. Above is a picture of me performing a kettlebell swing at the bottom of the swing. The picture on the top is a proper catch, with head up, eyes level, chest up and lower back strongly curved.\nBelow that on the left is a picture of a low back injury waiting to happen. The head is down, chest collapsed, shoulders rounded forward, low back rounded in a vulnerable position, knees too straight.\nThe next two pictures are a kettlebell shoulder press. The first is a proper press, with head up, torso upright, midsection tight, shoulders sunk in their sockets. The second is improper, with the shoulder out of position, the hips and the spine is twisted and bent into a vulnerable position.\nProtecting the joints through these movements involves priming and activating the muscles that support and protect these joints. Warm-up for these exercises should focus on activating the muscles of the core to maintain posture, and the muscles of the rotator cuff to keep the shoulder firmly engaged in the socket throughout the range of motion (ROM). My warm-up routine involves seven exercises which progressively increase in difficulty and intensity of activation of the targeted muscles. These exercises are:\nReach for the Sky\nBent Over Tabletop\nPlank Series\nAir Squat\nKettlebell Deadlift\nKettlebell Halo\nKettlebell Turkish Getup\nWhen performed one after the other the whole routine takes about 5-6 minutes.\nHow to Use this Instruction\nTake each exercise step-by-step and learn it thoroughly.

Stand tall with legs straight but no locked, glutes contracted, hips engaged and directly over heels, midsection firmly engaged, chest up, shoulders relaxed, head up and eyes forward.\nBegin the movement by bending slightly at the waist so that your hips move back behind your heels. Your knees will simultaneously take up a slight bend. Slowly, in a controlled fashion, continue to drive your hips back, keeping your chest as upright as possible. Continue to bend at the waist keeping your low back flat. Since your hips are (most likely) heavier than your upper body you will need to extend your chest and arms as far as you can to counter-balance your hips extending so far behind your heels. At about the point where your thigh bones become parallel to the ground you will need to bring your hips forward closer to your heels while you bend your knees. Try to squat down until you are sitting on your calves.\nAt the bottom of your squat your heels should be flat, knees bent to maximum, shins almost but not quite vertical, low back flat or only slightly curved, core tight, chest up and arms extended forward for balance. Keeping your core tight, engage your glutes and drive your hips backwards. At the same time keep your chest upright and flex your low back to keep it flat and return to the good lumbar curve.\nPerformance Points\nConcentrate on folding at the hips like a jack-knife. If you think about bending your knees they will come forward of your toes, which will prime your legs to engage the muscles of the quads rather than the more powerful glutes.\nUsing your hands like a karate chop to push back on that crease where your leg joins your torso can help reinforce this (see pictures above).\nYou should feel like you are going to fall over backwards if your hips are fare enough back. Practice sitting back into a chair to get the feel of this.\nKeep your midsection tight and chest up throughout.

Sculpting should take you about an afternoon, and painting another afternoon. In case you're wondering if you can do this or not: this Minion was made from my second block of clay, so I'm definitely not an expert myself. Just go out there, buy some clay, and amaze yourself with what you can do! If you don't succeed right away, try again and again.

I use Fimo Professional (from Staedtler). This one needs to be kneaded soft before you can use it. They also sell Fimo soft, which is already soft straight from the package. This makes it easier to manipulate, but you have to be more careful about where you hold your work piece so you don't ruin what you already sculpted. So choose wisely. In Europe, Fimo is easiest to find. If you live elsewhere, other brands (like Sculpey) might be easier to get.\nOther materials for sculpting are (see picture):\n- roller (mine is just a piece of PVC pipe, and about 30 times cheaper than the acrylic roller from Fimo)\n- palette knife (to blend pieces I can't reach with my fingers)\n- box cutter (to cut off pieces from the block of clay)\n- wire cutter\n- toothpicks (to add details)\n- aluminum wire (for reinforcing the limbs)\n- insulated wire (for the hair)\n- tin foil\nAdditional materials not included in picture:\n- acrylic primer (called gesso)\n- acrylic paint and brushes\n- super glue\nNote: My work surface is a vinyl mat. Make sure it's not made from PVC, because the chemicals in the clay will react with it and make it permanently wrinkled (I know from experience). You might argue that my roller is also from PVC, but it's too thick to be affected by the clay and the contact time between the two is short anyway.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJV/R0XD/IC5C2LBQ/FJVR0XDIC5C2LBQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Gather Your Materials"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "We could make the body entirely out of clay, but that would be a waste of clay.

Feel free to use your roller to smash the cylinder into shape.\nNext, take a good chunk of clay (don't be stingy), knead it soft and roll it flat (kneading should be done every time you make a part, so from now on I won't mention it every time). Wrap it around your tin foil cylinder and smooth everything out with your fingers.

Wrap it around the eye again and press slightly so it sticks. I find this way gives a cleaner result than blending directly on the work piece. Simply repeat the above if you make two eyes. Next, roll a larger sausage, wrap it around the entire head and cut off the excess. Then press it gently to make it flatter.\nFor the overall, knead a good chunk, roll it flat and make the corners square. Test to see how much you need to cut off.

Roll out a cylinder with one thick end (see first picture). Cut it open with your box cutter and insert an aluminum piece of wire. Aluminum is very bendable for its thickness, but if you don't have it, use thinner iron wire (stripped). Then close it up again and make it smooth. Be sure to leave a bit of wire sticking out, to make attaching it to the body easier. Bend the arm in the position you want. Pinch together some clay were the arm ends and the glove starts. Do the same to make a thumb. Use your box cutter to make the separate fingers. I made 4 fingers including thumb, but while writing this I noticed Minions only have 3 fingers in total. Anyway, try to spread those fingers open a bit, and make them rounder with your fingers. Position the fingers like you want, and you're ready to attach the arm. (If you're using different colors of clay, make the hand separately and attach it to the arm later). Just press the arm firmly into the body and blend it using your fingers or an instrument (like the palette knife). Roll out a small sausage to make the strap of the overall and place it above the arm. This will cover up any sloppy attachment at the shoulder, so you really only need to worry about the armpit being smooth. Repeat this process for the other arm. If your Minion is holding an object (like my boomerang), make that too and place it in one hand.\nBefore we attach the feet, now is the time to work a bit more on the details. They will transform your Minion from \"pretty okay\" to \"awesome\". I added some buttons to the straps of the overall, I added a breast pocket, I did all the stitching on the overall (with a toothpick) and I carefully sliced open the headband with my knife to make a groove along its entire length.\nLast step is making the feet. It's hard to explain, but you just have to make two lumps that look like feet (see picture), and stick two pieces of wire in it for attachment. Place the feet in a tray with baking paper. Press the body firmly onto those feet. Make sure they are centered when viewed from the front AND from the side. You could try and blend them a bit with the body, but I didn't bother because I made two sausages to make the borders of the overall (see last picture).\nOne thing I noticed is that the arms don't really like to stay in position, so I put some wooden blocks underneath for support.

I used acrylic paint. I dries fast and leaves a plastic-like layer that can't be washed off (so be careful with your clothes). Because it dries fast, it's best to keep the paint moist to prevent it from drying on your palette. I have a stay-wet palette that does just that, but if you don't have any, you could easily make one yourself using just a tray with some wet paper towel and baking paper on top. White baking paper is preferred so you can better judge colors.\nI mix all colors myself. Using the 3 primary colors (magenta, yellow and cyan) and black and white, you can make any color you want. But I cheated a little by also using brown. You'll need 2 brushes, a small one and an even smaller one. Use the smallest for the tricky places, like the boundary between skin and overall, the breast pocket logo and the eye(s). Don't worry if you mess up e.g. by accidentally putting darker color on the yellow. Just paint it white again (white has good coverage) and when it's dry redo the yellow. Here's a little color guide for all the colors you'll need:\n- skin is made from yellow with a tiny amount of magenta (red) and some white (best to give it 2 coats)\n- overall is cyan (blue) with some red mixed in to give it a more purple hue and some white to make it more jeans-like\n- gloves and headband are brown mixed with black, because I thought black from the tube would be too harsh.\n- feet are black\n- tongue is white with a bit of red\n- goggles are white with a tiny amount of black (this gives light grey), mixed with some special paint that gives a shimmering effect\n- eye is brown with a black dot in the middle and a tiny white spot to mimic reflection\n- the boomerang got a light brown coat and then I added stripes of darker brown (all in the same direction) to mimic wood grain\nAfter you're done painting your Minion, don't forget to give that insulated wire from earlier a brown coat (for next step). Wait a couple of hours after painting, then apply a varnish. I used a polyurethane varnish that is approved for toys.

One of the things that will bother just about any seasoned player is the twang of a ball hitting the undampened strings of a racquet.

Even Angry Birds have their own tennis racquet dampener.\nWith the power of a 3D printer and basic CAD skills, you can create a custom tennis dampener of your own.
