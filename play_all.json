[{"category": "Play", "description": "My friends and I just wrapped up our latest Dungeon's & Dragons campaign, and we've been planning the next one. Our DM wants us to try out 6 characters for the first few months before we dive into a long term campaign. I think this is a pretty cool move, because you can make sure the character you're going to have for the next 1-2 years is flight tested and ready. Once we've play tested our characters over the initial trial period, we'll pick just one.\nFor the first one, I came up with kind of a bizarre character concept - a doctor/physician that loses everyone he loves to a plague, and becomes completely obsessed with finding a cure. He sells everything he owns and joins the monastic society that sponsors his former university. At the monastery, he continues in his obsessive research and neglects self care. Late one night he's reaching for a simple tincture of iodine and his hand slips on the bottle, bringing an entire bookshelf of potions down on top of him. He's badly scarred and the elders at the monastery think he should find peace seeking the cure on the road. He takes his meager possessions, 10 gold pieces and dons the only vestments of his former life - a plague doctor's outfit. At that moment he loses a great deal of his humanity and becomes The Black Kestrel.\nA character with a backstory that dark needs an equally awesome miniature for the table. Searching for 'Plague Doctor Miniatures' reveals a 54mm metal figurine - a scale much too big, and the Reaper Chronoscope Plague Doctor miniature. The Reaper miniature in my opinion is good, but I wanted something great. It's just a doctor holding a flask in a bird mask. That's it. Straight standing posture, like he/she's standing in a laboratory - and never going to travel out of his/her pox-stricken village.\nThat would never do for The Black Kestrel. As we wrapped up the campaign today, I realized I'd need a miniature soon, so I started searching for minis on my phone. I could take an existing miniature - a human-sized hooded figure carrying the right type of weapon, and kit bash it!\nIf you're curious about the character's class & race - he's a human cleric. If he makes the longterm cut, I want to take a few ranger levels so I can get an animal companion (hawk).\nI have been binge-watching Black Magic Craft on YouTube and he's been really inspiring for me. I've been painting miniatures out of the box, no frills since December. I've wanted to level up my game so kit bashing a mini like BMC would be a good next step.\nThis episode was pretty inspiring to get me started working with Milliput.\nCredit: Black Magic Craft - Custom Cadaver Collector Miniature for D&D (episode 093)\nSince then I've wanted to kit bash my own miniature, so I'm glad I couldn't just find a plague doctor miniature I liked! ;-)", "title": "Kit-Bashed Plague Doctor Miniature Model", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Kit-Bashed-Plague-Doctor-Miniature-Model/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I've included Amazon.com links for the 2 miniatures needed, but I'd highly suggest finding a local game or comic book store and visiting them.

In his gloved hands he carries a vial or flask of a green liquid, and a long cane. The cane in the game mechanics of Dungeons and Dragons is statted out to be a mace, since he's a cleric. So it will be his weapon, as well as his holy symbol for his cleric class.\nFinding the elf wizard miniature at my local game shop was great - I just needed to knock off the fire in his hand and sculpt a face.\nTo prep the miniature, first we want to take off the flashing from the mold seams. As shown his legs have lines running up the edges. Paint will stick to those high spots and it will be obvious that I didn't tidy up the mold lines. After the cleanup, we need to remove the fire magic clear plastic on his hand. I was afraid I'd need to cut gently and take off a little and a time. So I probed some pressure near his hand in the flame with my Exacto knife just to see how easy the plastic would cut. All of the sudden, the plastic fire shot off his hand, removed perfectly cleanly - and still serviceable as a flame for another model! The difference in materials - clear plastic and primed white plastic made separation really easy.\nSaving little bits inside a Chessex dice container is a fantastic organization tip!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FU7/IPU2/JSPABXEF/FU7IPU2JSPABXEF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY6/9NVA/JSPABXEH/FY69NVAJSPABXEH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBV/XZ5W/JSPABXEG/FBVXZ5WJSPABXEG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ4/D4L0/JSPABXEJ/FZ4D4L0JSPABXEJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Prep the Miniature"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Once the fire was off the hand, I needed to trim down the excess plastic in his palm to enable him to hold a flask or bottle. I used needle files, emery boards, hobby saws and exacto knives to carve out a channel in his palm - taking care to not cut off his thumb too much.\nI selected the round bulbous bottle with a narrow top because it would give lots of glue surface to adhere to his hand. He would grip the bottle by the top, so I measured it against a needle file to make sure I wouldn't cut too deep. The best tool ended up being the hobby saw to hog out most of the material (we're talking millimeters here) and then clean it up with the emery boards and files.\nOnce the channel was cut into his palm -- leaving all 5 fingers, I carefully glued the flask into his hand using a tiny drop of cyanoacrylate (super glue). Once it was set, I put a larger drop over the bottle and let it seep into his hand. I then used an old medicine bottle, and some blue sticky tack to anchor him down at an angle that would prevent glue running. I let the CA glue fully dry before disturbing it. I wanted to ensure the flask wouldn't fall out of his hand - especially since removing the fire (same clear plastic) was so easy!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNG/W1EV/JSPABXHM/FNGW1EVJSPABXHM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9L/9BXO/JSPABXEK/F9L9BXOJSPABXEK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFY/MNDN/JSPABXEP/FFYMNDNJSPABXEP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F44/DFVB/JSPABXES/F44DFVBJSPABXES.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQS/LE0X/JSPABXEM/FQSLE0XJSPABXEM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXX/J6NN/JSPABXEW/FXXJ6NNJSPABXEW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Hand Me 50CCs of Awesome..."}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "At this point The Black Kestrel was really shaping up, so I took him and ran around the house to my wife and all my children and my dog. \"Hey look, but don't touch. Neat, yes? Do you like that he's holding a bottle! This is so good, my best work yet!\" ha ha ha.\nJust adding a new item in the model's hand is a new level up for me. So I guess I'm a level 3 modeler now? Time to choose my path feature... I think the kit-basher class feature is a great addition.\nLet's jump right into level 4 - sculpting with Milliput.\nMilliput and it's other cousins on the market (sometimes just called \"green stuff\") are a rock hard epoxy putty. It starts life as two separate tubes of clay-consistency sticky gunk. When you cut equal amounts and evenly mix them together (no streaks of any color - full uniform color) it kicks off a magic process and goes from sticky, to moldable like cold blue sticky tack (poster tack) to Sculpy/Fimo clay to rock hard.\nBeing a total newbie, I read the directions - which indicate that after an hour the putty will be firmer but workable. It seems like that was wisdom, but I ignored it. Being too excited I started sculpting while the Milliput was too soft.\nI taped down a piece of parchment paper to my desk and rolled a cylinder over it (sandwiched with more parchment) to flatten out a small amount.\nThen I cut out a small triangle with an Exacto knife. I learned that Milliput, especially when soft sticks to everything. Your fingers, itself, Exacto knives, dental picks, itself, unintended places on your model, itself, your fingers again... Use some water. Get your fingers wet, dip your tools in the water, it helps things not stick. It doesn't stick well to parchment paper.\nI took the triangle and shaped it into a beak shape and then mushed it into his face. Then I spent 10 minutes perfecting it. It was a beautiful beak face shape. I originally intended the eyes to be protruding from the surface like googles, but I couldn't find anything scale correct to punch out circles. The divot in a Lego minifig's head is not the right scale, ha ha. Instead, I poked in concave holes using a 2mm electronics standoff. The head was beautiful and perfect.... and I think you know where the plot is going to turn next.\n...\nYep. I wrecked it. I started sculpting some fingers on. I cut a small square and put it on the hand. The plan was to adhere the square to the hand over the bottle, then carve grooves in between the fingers - sculpt the fingers in situ, essentially. On one of my backstrokes carving the hand I smooshed his face (correct medical term). And had to start literally all over. I ripped off his face and attached a new triangle, re-sculpted it. Despite the failure, I fixed it pretty good and I'm really excited to do more Milliput sculptures in my models.\nSo... This is not the greatest face in the world... this is just a tribute.\nLessons learned:\nSculpt minor details first - start with the smallest stuff.\nSculpt key details last - maybe even wait for the other parts to dry\nBe patient and wait a bit to start working the Milliput so its a bit firmer.\nI'd rather slay a 100 goblins than 1 black dragon, but I've only ever done the latter.\nI cut a 1/4 inch of each side of the Milliput and had plenty left over. So I used the fire from his hand and sculpted a simple camp fire with the leftovers.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3T/0HEI/JSPABXJT/F3T0HEIJSPABXJT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRM/QL18/JSPABXHT/FRMQL18JSPABXHT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWN/517J/JSPABXHY/FWN517JJSPABXHY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2K/8PJ0/JSPABXI2/F2K8PJ0JSPABXI2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4K/A7N6/JSPABXIN/F4KA7N6JSPABXIN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6N/56UD/JSPABXIP/F6N56UDJSPABXIP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE2/ZLWT/JSPABXIR/FE2ZLWTJSPABXIR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Sculpt the Face and Fingers"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The Milliput package insert says that you can paint the hardened putty immediately, but I prefer to use a primer. I find that the even coating of under paint allows the acrylics to bond well. I know acrylics can bond well to primer, so that's what we're doing.\nReaper Bones plastic miniatures aren't primed - and I prime those too, with Acrylicos Vallejo grey primer.\nDeep Cuts miniatures, like the ones used here are pre-primed with Acrylicos Vallejo. But I primed the entire miniature again lightly to ensure that any oils, stray milliput or anything is well sealed and the paint would adhere evenly. I don't prime clear pieces obviously, so those can be masked with a bit of Silly Putty. You have to work a bit quickly though, because the Silly Putty moves and thins out a bit naturally from gravity.\nFor the paint job, I went with a black theme - but if I painted the entire miniature black head to toe, there would be no contrast, and no highlights and shadows.\n\nInstead, I did a charcoal gray base coat on everything except his mask, the items on his belt and his clear potion bottle. The mask I base coated a light bone color. The belt items were called out in black with the large pouch painted in light bone. Then I washed black all over the miniature except the areas painted in light bone. I want the mask and the potion bottle to be the focal point. The mask is washed in a sepia wash. The potion bottle is glazed part-way with green by mixing thinner medium and green paint. I also made sure the liquid in the bottle is level with the horizon line. After the wash dried, I dry brushed the miniature with charcoal gray and then lighter grays to bring out the highlights.\nI found a set of brushes at Hobby Lobby where one of the brushes has a bent tip, allowing reaching access into tight places.

Then I sculpted some details into the base and let it dry.\nFor the seal coat I always use brush on Matt Acrylic Varnish from Vallejo.

I was a young physician working long, late hours at the hospital in Kith, and it had begun to wear on me. My burden was softened that night when she came in - a broken clavicle, earned in a bar fight. Katya didn't tolerate sultry behavior, and nor did I. I mended her shoulder and she stole my heart. Months later we were wed, and a year later she bore our daughter. Everything was perfect, just like the stories the old bard tells in the town square for a copper piece. And that's when it all began to fall apart. First my daughter got the symptoms. Black fingers, toes. Bleeding, vomiting. Eventually she died - I felt so powerless, so helpless as a physician. I researched and documented everything - trying to find a cure, trying to spare another father from losing his child. And then, my wife, my beloved Katya had fallen to the plague. I was broken. I had nothing left, so I turned to the Order. I had studied at an Order University, so membership to the Order could be obtained anytime after graduation. But the commitment to the Order is a lifetime, and breaking that commitment meant consequences. I had spent my fortune as a physician and mortgaged my estate to try and find the cure. Finding myself homeless and alone I joined the Order. Just as seasons change and the moons drift in the sky, the epidemic ceased. The plague disappeared just as mysteriously as it had arrived. Haunted by my past I continued my work at the monastery, furiously trying to find a cure should the disease return. Late one night I was too fatigued to work, but continued nonetheless. Reaching for a simple tincture of iodine, my hands trembling on the bottle, at once lost their purchase and fell, knocking an entire bookcase of potions and vials all over my body. Broken and burned I lie on the ground, defeated like a bird with clipped wings. The members of the Order saved me that night, but my body was so burned and disfigured that I'd never be recognized by anyone. So shamed by my appearance, I cloaked myself in black, donned a black leather hat and gloves - and the only vestment of my former life - a plague doctor's mask.\nThe Order could not use a cleric so distracted at the monastery. I had kept my oath to serve and protect the innocent, but the Elders of the Order felt that I needed to spend some time among the people - serving, protecting and healing them to find inner peace again. I agreed with them, mostly because it would grant me the ability to research disease in the field and at larger libraries.\nDr Falco Tinnunculus died that day, and The Black Kestrel was born.\n\n\n----\n\nI've also uploaded The Black Kestrel's character sheet.

The pictures above are from a commercial version that was available in the 1980's.\nYou can still buy a boxed version of the game, but really all you need is a regular pack of cards.\nPart of the game involves revealing your bid at the same time as the other players. In the example shown, each player had a set of bidding cards and a little plastic stand in which to place the relevant card. This is a terrible design really - the cards would fray where they needed to slot into the plastic holder and the most often used cards would quickly sustain creases that became recognisable.\nWhy is Oh Hell such a good game?\nIt is a trick taking game with some similarities to whist or bridge, but with a simpler scoring system;\nYou can play with 3 to 7 players;\nIt is easy to pick up;\nEach hand is different, as it uses a different number of cards;\nThe strategy for play changes on each hand;\nThere are infinite variations that you can play depending on the time you have.\nBelow are the rules that we use, but an internet search will yield many variations.\nOh Hell!\nPlayers: 3 to 7\nDeck: Standard 52 Card Deck\nGoal: To score the most points by accurately predicting how many tricks you will win from each hand.\nPlay: Shuffle the cards & choose a dealer.\nEach new hand will be dealt by the player to the left of the previous dealer.\nFor the first hand, deal out as many cards as you want to have rounds.\nThe remaining cards are placed in a stack, and the uppermost card turned up. This indicates the trump suit.\n(If all cards are dealt out (e.g. 13 cards for 4 players), this hand may be played as a no-trump hand.\nEach player must then decide how many tricks they think they will win in that hand.\nThey indicate this on the Oh Hell! Marker.\nWhen all players are ready, all are revealed at the same time.\nPlay commences with the player to dealer\u2019s left and continues until all tricks are taken, after which that hand is scored.\nScoring: Each player receives one point for each trick taken.\nPlayers who achieve their stated target receive a bonus TEN points.\nPlay continues with each subsequent hand being one less card than the previous round. In this way, the final hand consists of each player holding just one hand.\nVariations:\nThere are endless possible adjustments that can be made to the play and the scoring e.g:\nAscending/descending numbers of cards per hand;\nBidding rules ensuring that there is at least one loser per round;\nPlaying just the even or odd numbers is a good idea if you don't have time for a full game.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FC1/HJQA/JT2SKRYV/FC1HJQAJT2SKRYV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2O/YZAS/JT2SKRO6/F2OYZASJT2SKRO6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6Z/TLZI/JT2SKSDN/F6ZTLZIJT2SKSDN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Z/XMAV/JT2SKRVY/F8ZXMAVJT2SKRVY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Oh Hell!

Basically, the peg that sits inside the wooden lock has a hole drilled into it from above. This hole then receives a small recess that is about an 1/8\" in diameter so that you can glue a rare earth magnet of the same size directly onto the peg. Above this magnet is a hole that contains a smooth metal bolt that is connected to a wooden cap embedded with another magnet. So after you attach this mechanism to the wall across from your centrifugal peg, the only way to unlock this peg is to turn the box upside down and bang it on a table or hard surface.

I grew up playing D&D with my brothers and still play the popular role playing game today with friends and family members. There are some awesome miniatures that you can buy which usually cost anywhere from 3 to 4 dollars to 60 to 100 for dragons, etc. If you are running an adventure with very few monsters, it may not be too expensive to spend some money and buy some. I always have tons of monsters and characters in my adventures/campaign so I wanted to create paper minis so it was lighter on the pocketbook. I have made so many of these now. They do take a little bit of time, but most of that time can be spent working in front of the TV, so you can kill two birds with one stone. They are easy to make if I can make them, you can make them, let's get started!\nDon't forget to follow me and check out my other instructables. :)\nIf you have any questions or comments leave them down below and I will get back to you as soon as I can. :)\nFollow the steps below or watch the video tutorial or do both. :)", "title": "Dungeons and Dragons Paper Miniatures (Pathfinder, Warhammer, Etc.)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Dungeons-and-Dragons-Paper-Miniatures-Pathfinder-W/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Here is a list of items you will need to make these:\ncardboard\npaper (thicker stock will hold up a little better, but you need to be able to fold it)\npacking tape\nscissors or exacto knife\nglue stick or spray adhesive\nhot glue gun\nphoto editing program (I use Photoshop)\nbingo chips or another type of base\npaper mini base holders (I use the one from my Dead of Winter Board Game)\nThe above links are affiliate links, clicking on them helps me make more instructables. :)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXM/KS9W/JT4TQ7JG/FXMKS9WJT4TQ7JG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Things You Need"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "First we need to create our paper with the monsters and characters.

These play great straight through a PA system, but are less desirable for cabling to an amp. On an amp you want a reading of 1000 or more ohms. To convert the low to high, you need an \u201cimpedance matching transformer.\u201d\nThere are transformers you can attach to your microphone cable, but we want to keep this in the shell, so it needs to be small. In our build we will use one available from Shure, but don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s still cheap. $7 from Full Compass Systems. Shure 51A312\nWiring\nHere\u2019s your delicate soldering task. These wires are tiny, 22 gauge, and are easily broken, especially when stripping the ends. So be careful.\nThe transformer has 5 wires. You\u2019ll only be using 4 of the five. Each wire is a different color. Two wires go to the cable connector, and 2 wires go to the element. You can choose to use shrink tubing or electrical tape over the solder points. The tubing works better.\nThese wiring instructions came from the late Dave Scudamore, who was a great harp mic builder in Chicago. Here are his recommended connections:\n1. Transformer Red wire soldered to positive (red) wire of the connector.\n2. Transformer Black wire soldered to negative (black) wire of the connector.\n3. Transformer Green wire soldered to the positive connection on the element\n4. Transformer Yellow wire soldered to the negative connection on the element (see option for Orange wire below)\n5. Clip and insulate the orange wire.\n(According to Scudamore\u2019s instructions, you will hear a difference in your sound depending on using the Yellow or Orange wire as the negative contact of the element. He suggested you try both, and see which one you like better. He said the yellow usually sounds best.)\nThough you don\u2019t need to secure the transformer, you may find a hot glue gun handy here. I glue the transformer to the element before soldering the wires to the the contacts. When I\u2019m done soldering, I use the glue to cover the contact points and wires.

In this case, I don't remember the thought process that led to the design, but I know when it happened! You can see the initial sketch I made in my pocket notebook (the one I carry around for grocery lists and things). You can see the essential design elements are there at the start -- two unfolded wings, joined at an angle, with a guitar cradle and the bottom. It's not exactly what emerged, but it was enough to get me going down the path. I think this is the most important thing to keep in mind: when you have a great idea, write SOMETHING down somewhere so you don't forget about it!\nThe heart of the project are the wings that form the sides of the guitar stand. For these, I looked around for pictures of wings that I thought were good guides. Most of the ones you can find are semi-realistic, with all the details and structure of the feathers, but I was primarily interested in just the outline. Once I found one I liked, I freehanded the outline of a similar wing shape in Adobe Illustrator. I used the pen tool and made an editable bezier curve. My initial goal was to just get the basic outline down, then I edited and fiddled with it until I had made a shape I liked.\nYou can find all kinds of images of wings that swoop very high, some that go up and the sweep down. I wanted one that was roughly flat across the top, with the lower descending edge of the wing to show the scalloped shape of the feathers. In the end, the wing I ended up with wasn't much like any of the ones I had seen, but it looked recognizably like a wing!\nOnce I had a shape I liked, I had two requirements:\nIt had to have a flat lower edge that rested on the floor for stability\nI wanted the wing to be visible even with a guitar on it, but not be so huge it dominated the room. It also couldn't be so small that it would not reasonably provide support for the guitar.\nAs I was working I kept silhouettes of guitar bodies in the document as well, to insure the scale of the wings was a good size in relation to the guitars.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F08/95WB/JSITNV4U/F0895WBJSITNV4U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSB/C0QP/JSEZ5USA/FSBC0QPJSEZ5USA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Pattern Preparation"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "One of the things I like about the xCarve is that it makes it easy to cut out complex shapes (like the scalloped edge of the wings). It cuts with mulitple router passes which makes a very clean edge compared to a saw, so the sanding and cleanup before finishing is much less tedious.\nOverall, the wings have a dimension of 23 in wide x 28.7 in tall, so it required almost the full range of motion along the rail direction of a 1000mm xCarve (total workspace accessible to the router is about 75cm x 75cm [29.5 in x 29.5 in]).\nFor those who have never seen an xCarve, or are thinking about purchasing one, I'll outline the xCarve process in detail for the rest of this step to give you a sense of how it goes. If you don't want to read all of this and go onto the next step, all you need to know is \"I cut the wings out of the pine panels using a router. The wings are mirror images of each other, so for the right wing I simply flipped the pattern for the left wing.\" :-)\nThe xCarve process goes something like this:\n[1] To place the workpiece, especially large ones, you need to know what the boundaries of the xCarve workspace are and make sure everywhere you need to cut lies inside it. For easier reference, I've marked my wasteboard with the limits the router can reach.\n[2] First you have to secure the material to your workspace. The xCarve has an array of tapped holes with threaded inserts so you can place clamps around the edges of a workpiece that screw down into the tapped holes. You can order a set of nice plastic clamps of various sizes from Inventables, but you can also make your own out of wood blocks and use 5-mm socket cap screws to secure them to your xCarve workspace. For the wings, they were cut out of panels that spanned the table, with the ends falling well outside the xCarve cutting space, so I secured the panel with bar clamps directly to the table frame.\n[3] Once your piece is secure, double check where the clamps are and where the router is going to run. There are two things to watch for -- first that the cut line does not run under any clamp you've placed, and second that the router doesn't run over a clamp when it is moving itself from one position to another. I've certainly failed in this last case -- routers cut through plastic camps great! :-)\n[4] To use an xCarve you must provide a pattern for it to cut. This is done through a web-browser with a computer that is connected to your xCarve with a USB cable. The interface is called \"EASEL\" and looks kind of like a computer drawing program inside a web-browser interface. For every line in a drawing, EASEL allows you to specify a cut depth, and whether to cut on your line, inside your line, or outside your line. For closed figures, you can tell it to completely remove material inside the figure to any depth. The interface allows you to specify the material, and has recommended cut settings for the router. I've shown a screen capture of the EASEL interface in the 4th image above. If you don't want to draw directly in EASEL, you can import SVG graphics; this is what I prefer to do, preparing my figures in Adobe Illustrator, exporting to SVG, then importing the SVG into EASEL. I've included my Illustrator and SVG files for the wings at the end of this step.\n[5] In the last image above, you can see how EASEL has its coordinates laid out with respect to the piece you are carving. The first step in carving is to tell the xCarve where the corner of the EASEL space is. To do this you manually jog the router over to where you want the cutting process to regard as the lower left corner of its workspace. I usually make this correspond to an actual corner of my material so what is physically laid out on my table looks like what is laid out on EASEL. Next you jog the router down to tell the xCarve where the top of the work surface is; it uses this reference to make all the cuts the correct depth. This part can be done manually by simply lowering the router until it touches the surface, but they also have an automated add-on called a \"Z-probe\" that you can use (this is what I do).\n[6] Carve! Based on the cuts it has to make the xCarve figures out the most efficient cut plan, and gets to work, making multiple shallow passes until it has cut out the piece to your specifications. Each of the wings took about an hour to cut out.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FV3/PGTC/JSEZ5UUI/FV3PGTCJSEZ5UUI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ7/PXKE/JSEZ5UUJ/FZ7PXKEJSEZ5UUJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVD/SVOK/JSEZ5UUK/FVDSVOKJSEZ5UUK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSH/QT4Y/JSEZ5UWJ/FSHQT4YJSEZ5UWJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQR/OMY2/JSEZ5UWM/FQROMY2JSEZ5UWM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Carving the Wings"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The feet are a reasonably simple shape and could have been cut with a jig saw.

This allows the stand to hold both thin-body electric guitars, or wider body acoustic guitars. The base of the guitar sits in the cut-out of the foot, and the rear side of the cut is angled to help the guitar lean back against the wings for support.

Because of this I opted to have the entire thing screwed together without gluing it.\nI had a competing desire that I didn't want to see any screw heads! So the stand is bound together using metal angle brackets in strategic, hidden places. The brackets tied the various pieces of the stand together, giving it rigidity.\nI used 4 1-inch L-brackets to hold the shelf, and two 1-1/2 inch L-brackets to connect the long legs to the back of the wings. I used two additional 1-inch L-brackets in places that were not at right angles -- behind the apex of the wings, and where the long feet meet at the back of the stand. I had to bend both of these brackets out of their manufactured shape. For the apex bracket, I pinched the ends together with a pair of pliers, and for the foot bracket I turned it upside down on my bench anvil and pounded it wider with a hammer.

This also means using an extra pair of wires to connect the motors to the external pack, but I felt that was a small sacrifice to greatly reduce the number of internal wires (and the switches) of the hard-wired version.

Use a Phillips head to remove the screws from the controller and take off the back panel; there's no need to remove anything else. Be careful you don't lose the L and R buttons though as these have a tendency not to stay in place.\nThe rumble pack is even simpler with two screws, once you get your hands on a gamebit. If you are using a first-party pack, it already comes with JST connectors, so you shouldn't have to worry about buying these.

We also know that the controller is receiving power from the N64 console itself. So it is simply a matter of finding ~3 V from the controller and connecting that to where the battery power source is expected.\nThus, I faced two main tasks:\n1. Locate ~3 V from the controller's internal power.\n2. Locate points that are connected to the battery positive input terminal\nAnd there are mainly three ways this could be approached:\n1. Find and read original schematics to determine these key points\n2. Visually follow the PCB traces\n3. Probe various areas with a multimeter\nWhile 2 or especially 1 would likely find a more accurate result, I went with option 3 as it was much easier to just measure different values. I'm not sure if these are the optimal points, but they worked out for me.\nLocating a 3V Point\nTo locate a 3 V point, I plugged in the controller and turned the game on with the rumble pack circuit inserted. This is shown in the photo. You need to have the rumble pack cover as well as the controller back cover removed in order to be able to probe around with the multimeter.\nLocating the battery terminal\nThere is one obvious place where you can connect the battery, which is the big terminal marked with a + on the the PCB. You can use this if you plan to keep the board intact, but I wanted to trim it down, so I looked for another. I did this by placing one probe at the + terminal and the other at various other points to test for other options. Some multimeters have a continuity test option; with mine I used the diode setting and the lowest resistance setting. These should both read a value if there is continuity, and the lower the value of both, the more direct of a connection to the terminal (i.e. not going through resistors and other components). I found a point on one end of the resistor marked in the photo, which I believe is the most direct available.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1L/O2SK/JSAORZWX/F1LO2SKJSAORZWX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNX/7A1R/JSAOVTD8/FNX7A1RJSAOVTD8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQA/NMPY/JSAORZX1/FQANMPYJSAORZX1.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Determining Wiring for Battery-Free"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Complete the wiring from a valid 3V node to a power in (battery) node, such as the photo shown.

Re-connect the motor JST connector and snap the rumble pack together (you don't need to screw it back together). Snap the back half of the controller on (again, no need to mess with the screws), put the pack in and test it out.

You want this to be big enough to fit the wires (and possibly shrink wrap) but not the JST connector; I went with 5/32\"\nCut the (male) JST connector off from the rumble pack motor. Make sure you leave enough wire to work with on the connector side, though don't cut it too long if you plan on also reusing the motor at some point.\nInsert the wires from the male JST into the interior side of the controller through the hole. I used scotch tape to hold the JST in place temporarily.\nPlace the motors down in the center and right prongs to eyeball how much wire you'll need for each (don't remove the adhesive label yet). Keep in mind the JST will be pulled out further in the final version so you want to leave some slack, but also make it easy to close.\nIt's here that I'll mention these motors can easily be tested by holding the two exposed parts of the wire against the two terminals of a AA or AAA battery. As far as I can tell, the polarity doesn't matter, but I'd recommend keeping it consistent if you are using two motors. I went with red to red and blue to black.\nThis set of steps leads up to the second photo depicted:\nCut appropriate lengths of wire (ideally black and red) and solder these up to the motor wires.\nOptionally, once you have an elongated motor wire pair, test it using the battery method above.\nSlip a small length of heat shrink over the exposed connection and heat it.\nOnce you've done the above for all four (assuming two motors) motor wires, slip small pieces of heat shrink down the wires on the JST side (this is necessary now because after the next step there won't be any wire ends left).\nTwist together the respective red motor wires from both wires, then twist and solder this pair to the red JST wire.

I had an old third-party memory pack lying around that I don't really need, so I thought it was a good choice (plus I could just swap its board into the rumble pack shell). You could probably also just use the rumble pack shell and maybe trim it down if you have a good tool like a Dremel (I don't, so that wasn't my route).\nTrim down the rumble pack board\nMake sure you don't remove any crucial parts. I basically just cut off the battery connector part with flush cutters, as shown in the photo.\nDisassemble and trim down the memory card shell\nThe memory card circuit ended up being held by a couple little nubs. I didn't really care to try to make holes in my rumble circuit to fit on those, but the flush cutters made quick work of the nubs. That gave me a better idea of how it would fit, but the (female) JST connector was clearly in the way.\nRemove the JST connector\nLuckily, it wasn't really in the way because it was part of the plan all along to remove it. Desolder this from the board, while taking careful note both on the connector and the board where the positive/negative terminals belong.\nDrill a hole in the shell\nI marked and drilled a hole in the shell where the JST connector would come out, very similar to the controller. It helps to lightly put the shell and controller together to get an idea of the orientation and clearance. I chose to drill it so it would come out on the right side, just like with the male connector.\nSolder everything\nFirst, solder small (but again, with enough slack), ideally red and black lengths of wire to the JST terminals corresponding to positive and negative respectively. I found that having a helping hands tool is really useful with this part, since it's hard to hold the wire onto the JST. Once you get these, insert the wires up through the interior of the memory card shell, then solder onto the corresponding terminals of the rumble board where the JST connector originally was.\nAssemble\nPut the memory card back together with the rumble board inside. I ended up cutting down some more of the plastic so that the wires wouldn't be crushed when it was laid flat, as shown in the last photo. As I would later find out, it's very important that the 16 pins are pushed down as far as you can go so that it rests nicely in the little \"groove\" shaped around it. Hot glue eventually helped me keep it in place. Knowing this would've saved me a lot of troubleshooting, as I thought the pack was inserted into the controller fully, but it turned out to not be close enough.

That is, my son was drawn by lottery to take one of the two openings of Montessori school in the district on public basis.\nUpon first visit of the classroom, I was impressed by the didactic materials and classroom environment. I thought we were lucky to have the best teacher in the world, it's all her ideas. Before the visit, I knew almost nothing of the Montessori Method except the name. So my son was not raised in accordance to the Montessori education philosophy or approach up until then. For example, like many others, we dressed our son, doing things like button his shirt, zip his coat and tie his laces so that life seems to go faster and easier. This is exactly the opposite of the Montessori Method.\nIn the Montessori method, Dr. Montessori created a series of dressing frames, which she called the fastening games for children to practice practical life skills. Through the use of such toys, the children can practically analyse the movements necessary in dressing and undressing themselves, and can prepare themselves separately for these movements by means of repeated exercise. Thus, parents or teachers can succeed in teaching the child to dress himself without his really being aware of it, that is, without any direct or arbitrary command he is lead to his mastery.\nDr. Montessori started her work with deficient children. The difference is plainly seen from the fact that the same materials, such as dressing frames, used with deficient children makes education possible, while with normal children it provokes auto-education.\nProvoking children's auto-education is a huge part in the Montessori education and the difference from common parents' and others' practices which give direct commands or do the movements for the children. It is quite common once children pass the stage of learning certain skills, they have neither mastered the skills, nor have they any interest to learn them anymore. This is a confirmed tough truth I knew from raising my first child and also from the famous wild boy found near Aveyron. Every time when I think of my being ignorant of the scientific pedagogy of The Montessori Method up until now, and the areas of my first child's formation that could be better, I felt regret, to say the least. However, there is no medicine for regret. I decided to read more about it and try to practice more of it in my remaining parenting-educating life. So far, I have read three books on the topic. I'm listening to the fourth book. And I compiled a list of 12 books plus one DVD to awake the Montessori educator potential in every parent.\nFor Montessori dressing frames, as far as I know, there are 12 frames. There are usually kept standing in wooden box stand or in a wooden shelf stand. They are quite expensive. In this Instructable, I show how to make six of the most common dressing frames using used toddler clothes. And I decided to hang them on a wall at the height of 3- to 4- year old in his activity center. If you have a two or three years old child, it's perfect time to make these toys for them. Hope this Instructable will come in handy as reference.\nMaterials and Tools Used:\n6 Toddler shirts ( preferably one button shirt, one zipper shirt, one snap shirt, thus the job to install these fasteners is eliminated in later steps.)\nSewing machine\nSerger machine (optional)\nSewing tools, such as scissors, seam ripper, pins, and tape ruler\nDarning needle\nHand-sewing needle for leather or machine needle for leather\nSnaps, snap machine or snap tool, or snaps with snap tool\nSelf disappearing marking pen\n1 Piece of long lace or 1 piece of yarn and 2 pieces of 1\" packing tape to tape the ends of the yarn\nRubber head hammer\n1 Spool of 3/8\" red ribbon, 1 spool of 3/8\" blue ribbon\n4 Buckles\nHand sewing finger tip protector\n2 10 feet long 1/2\" PVC pipe or 5/8\" wooden dwell\n24 1/2\" copper 90 degrees elbow\n24\" long 1/2\" wooden dwell, cut into 6 of 4\" long each\n6 clothes hanger with metal hook or 6 white vinyl coated 1 1/2\" screw in hook\n6 COMMAND damage free hook for 2 lb\nDrill and Driver with 3/32\" drill bit\nCopper wire cutter\nHacksaw\n\nBelow are the steps.\n\nNote: This article may contain affiliate links as references for the same or similar products used in this project.

You can then decide on what shape you would like each wing of the board to have (by wing I\u2019m referring to either side of the tie outline on your gameboard ).\nOnce the overall shape of the gameboard is determined, cut out the shape and use it as a template to trace an outline that is a \u00bc\u2019\u2019 larger onto the piece of fabric you\u2019ll be using. To achieve an accurate \u00bc\u2019\u2019 larger outline, use either a compass found in geometry sets set to a \u00bc\u2019\u2019 or an appropriately sized washer, follow the edge of the template as a guide with a pencil inside the center of the washer. Following the larger traced outline, cut out the gameboard shape from the piece of fabric with a rotary cutter and put it to the side.\n*Rotary cutters are scary sharp and should only be used against a metal rule.\nOn your cardstock template start designing the look of your game. Consider what parts of the gameboard will be crossing the tie portion of the board. I chose to start at the tie portion of the gameboard so that I could conceal the gameboard tiles within the tie\u2019s pattern. This is also when to decide on the colour scheme of your gameboard.

There are two ways of approaching the construction of the knot: either by using recyclables or by 3D printing it.\nRecyclables Approach:\nStart by drawing or tracing an approximately proportioned triangular neck tie knot shape on a piece of cardstock. Use this cardstock template to locate a piece of curved plastic on a plastic bottle that resembles the correct shape. Trace the shape onto the bottle with a marker and carefully cut it out with a craft or hobby knife; if you happen to have Kevlar or similar cut resistant gloves, wear one on your non-dominant hand holding the bottle.\nCut and add plastic strips to the sides of the triangular plastic piece with hot melt glue to make up the sides of the knot. Then cut and glue on a similarly shaped triangular piece to make up the back of the plastic knot container. Lastly, cut a piece that will adequately cover the top opening of the knot container and include a 1-inch tab towards the backwards facing side of the piece. DO NOT glue in this piece just yet.\nGift wrap your plastic knot container with the same fabric as the gameboard, leaving the top uncovered. Then, cut a strip of fabric that is wide enough to cover up the top opening and long enough to be both glued to the inside of the plastic knot container securely and long enough to overhang the back of the knot container by at least 1\u00bd\u201d.\nGlue one end of the fabric strip inside towards the front of the plastic knot container. Then, glue the piece of plastic large enough to cover the top opening of the container cut earlier to the fabric strip. The fabric should act like a living hinge that allows you to open the lid of the plastic knot container. Tidy up the other end of the overhanging fabric strip and attach either a small strip of Velcro or glue a small neodymium magnet to its end. Next, glue a mating piece of Velcro or a magnet to the back of the plastic knot container. To complete the knot, attach another strip of Velcro or small neodymium magnet to the back of the knot. This will enable it to be attached to the tie shaped gameboard in the next step. I should mention that constantly checking to see whether the die and game pieces fit inside of the plastic knot container is essential to ensure that you will always have everything necessary to play the game!\n3D Printing Approach:\nUsing the free browser-based 3D modeling software Tinkercad, start modeling a neck tie knot shape to the approximate scale of a real neck tie knot. To tinker with my model, search \"Board Game Tie Knot\" in the Tinkercad Gallery. Ungroup the model to see how I used simple geometric shapes to make it! Please feel free to make your knot as interesting and feature packed as you want!

project is an innovation to the ordinary \"cornhole\" or \"bean bag toss\" where instead of just a single hole on the board, there is a target with multiple point values like the game of darts. This is a very fun innovation for a sunny afternoon when the family is bored and there is nothing to do. This is easily accessible and comes with 3 bean bags for each team and portable bag to carry the bean bags. I hope that you enjoy this project because it took a lot of hard work and dedication to think of, design and build.\n*Allow about 1 day in between painting each coat.\nThe purpose to this project is a game in which is played similarly to ladderball and cornhole in that you should stand between 10 and 15 feet away from the target. You can keep track of points however you want to and play to whatever high score that you want to in order to appease your needs. I did not include any numbers on the board because I think it is more fun to make up the numbers that you intend to be working with at th start of the game. I recommend using 50 points for the outermost section, 100 points for the middle section and 250 points for the center section and playing until someone reaches 1000 points(without going over or else your score goes back down to 750).

It may help to look at a real oven mitt, but the most important thing for making it look oven-mitt-like is to have the shape of the mitt go straight down from the tip of the thumb, not back inward around the thumb, like a mitten. Picture 4 shows my first attempt, which had the mitten-like thumb shaping, and was rather difficult to put on and take off. You want a wide wrist, so the mitt can be easily slipped on and off.\nRemember that the completed mitt will look somewhat smaller than the flat shapes, so try to make them a little bigger than you feel they should be. It's better to have a mitt that's a little big, than one that's too tight (especially if you consider growing room).

This will be your seam allowance. A transparent ruler helps for doing this more accurately. As with the fleece, you'll need two shapes, but be careful! If your fabric has distinct right and wrong sides, make sure the thumbs face opposite directions when the right sides face up! Line the fleece shapes up with the fabric ones, and cut a line from the indent in the outline at the thumb, to the point in the fleece shape where the thumb and palm meet.\nYou should end up with two fleece shapes about the size of the paper, and two somewhat bigger fabric shapes, that are roughly mirror images of each other.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FET/ZVOB/JQWSW5RY/FETZVOBJQWSW5RY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMD/2USV/JQWSW5SZ/FMD2USVJQWSW5SZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUN/NKGO/JQWSW5UO/FUNNKGOJQWSW5UO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOT/8S4B/JQWSW5UR/FOT8S4BJQWSW5UR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFG/6MLH/JQWSW5UV/FFG6MLHJQWSW5UV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Cut Out All the Pieces"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "If you've never quilted anything before, don't let the word \"quilting\" scare you!

Then decide on a pattern; generally a simple pattern of criss-crossing or parallel lines will look most like a normal oven mitt. You can lightly draw the pattern on the fabric with a washable pencil, or just use a strip of paper as a guide to make straight, evenly spaced lines, like I did. Sew along the desired lines.\nMake sure the fleece shape is on the wrong (non-printed) side of the fabric! If the fabric is basically the same on both sides, make sure the thumbs point opposite directions when the fleece shapes are facing up. It's rather frustrating to find out, after you've quilted the pieces together, that no matter how you try to assemble it, one of the pieces has the padding on the outside. Yes, that happened.\nYou will also finish the bottom edge in this step. This can be done before or after the overall quilting; if you do it before, you can stop the quilting lines at the bottom edge line, to give the illusion of a binding. It just depends on which look you prefer; picture 4 shows a comparison of both. Anyway, just fold the bottom edge of the fabric over the fleece.

They bring great memories from my childhood, I love to visit toy stores to check for the last generations of this toy, I have a very small collection and even my first experiment with CAD was designing my own transformable robot using the fantastic 123D Design!\nNevertheless, I'm not a kid anymore, I look like a creepy old guy when I go alone to toy stores (at least in this country), nobody gave a new Transformer for Christmas to expand my collection, and 123D Design is gone forever, dragging my dear first design to the Desert of the Obsolete Nothingness.\nThe solution? I created my very own new Transformer, using Tinkercad!\nThis opportunity was not only to test my skills in this design application. It was also to test the limits of my new Biqu Magician 3D Printer. After several printing experiments (resulting in a lot of broken or failed prototypes), finally I got an acceptable result.\nThis is basically a G1 inspired Decepticon that transforms from robot to a military missile-launching vehicle. This project required a lot of test/improve, because I tried three different design approaches for the articulation of every part:\nFirst, I tried using the Tinkercad connectors to have joints that can detach when too much pressure is added to a piece, system used in almost all new Transformers. This idea failed because the general design was too big for the printing area, and when I tried reducing the scale, the performance of the connectors was affected, being easily breakable.\nSecond, I tried modifying the design to be printed already assembled, so I only had to remove the support materials to have a Transformer ready for action. It worked in theory. However, joints were too loose and easily breakable, causing the car to never keep form and the robot unable to stand by itself.\nThird and last, I tried a \"hybrid\" approach. Wheels and missile launcher were printed already attached to the robot; feet and thighs can be put together by a printed axle, and shoulders and crotch articulation would use a normal iron bolt and nut to keep them in place with enough friction to keep the robot in the intended position.\nThis instructable shows how I developed the first and second approaches.

If you understand the reference you are now my friend. Today we are a making a real-life version of Eels and Escalators. This classic game made its debut in the Spongebob episode: \"Sailor Mouth\". It was the game that Spongebob couldn't seem to ever win. Recently, I thought how fun it would be to play that game in real life. Unfortunately, it doesn't exist except for fan-made 2D versions, and sketchy web versions... until today.\nOn this Instructable, I teach you how to make your very own version of Eels and Escalators.

I have a goal in the coming year to start selling the 3D files I make on some platform like etsy because I took the \"Starting a hand-made Business\" class right here on Instructables and I want to see what kind of attention my work might get on a platform like that. ( Sit tight - The files should be up for sale very soon) 2. The 3D files for this one are so easy that you could finish all of the pieces in probably an hour or less. I used a screen shot from the episode as reference for these pieces.\nFirst you will want to do the escalators which is about the easiest thing to model on Fusion 360. I drew a couple straight lines and a cylinder for the rail - done.\nNext you will want to do the Eels. Using the spline function, I was able to re-create the curvy bodies in a semi-random kind of way. If you play around with it, you will make eels that are one-of-a-kind and to your liking.\n*Note* You may be asking why I am printing the when in the episode they are drawn on the board. I wanted this game to have something to come back to. If you played with the same game board every time you will get board (The irony). So to overcome that, I am 3D printing the eels in order to be able to move them around the board. This way you will have a new game to play nearly ever time. (Feel free to make the eels different sizes and shapes)\nNext I did the small game pieces. These little guys are just funny to look at. I made 4 of them so you could play this game with multiple people (Again to make it more exciting). The shape was pretty straightforward.\nAnd finally, I decided to make the dice. I noticed in the episode that the dice only had eels and esclators on it. This made the squares on the board useless. So i added numbers 1-3 on both dice with one dice having two eels and 1 escalator on it, and the other having two escalators and one eel on it. This way you can still move through the board normally but could also roll the coveted \"escaltors\" or the dreaded \"eels\".", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6W/OYX7/JQGYM1C7/F6WOYX7JQGYM1C7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F53/YOWB/JQGYM1BV/F53YOWBJQGYM1BV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: 3D Modeling the Pieces"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "This was one of my favorite parts of the build because the pieces have such vibrant colors.\n*Note* I don't think you will need wood filler for this project because the geometry is so simple and looks good with just primer on it*\nFirst, lay down a couple coats of primer. Make sure all of the edges are primed up and the deep corners of the stairs in the escalator. This is one of those hard-to-reach spots and may need some extra attention.\nNext, you will want to paint the game pieces / eels / escalators. For the eels, you can use just a basic green - no surprises there. For the 4 game pieces, I wanted to feature the two original orange and white pieces and I painted the last two just a standard red and blue. The escalators are the somewhat tricky part. They have the classic Spongebob Hawaiian flower design on the side which you could either freehand or print off an example and cut out the interior - thus making a stencil. I would recommend painting the entire escalator before putting the flowers on though.

Just a couple of red squares and a blue background - which is even better because before this, I have never even touched adobe illustrator/photoshop. If you are in the same boat as me, I would highly recommend watching some brief youtube tutorials to get you started. This is really just a couple of squares arranged in a game board-like fashion so you shouldn't have too much trouble. Just make sure that you start your \"canvas\" as an 18 inch x 18 inch square so that once you print out the color board, it will fit perfectly on to your game board. As far as the colors are concerned, pull up an image of the game board on google and use the eye-dropper function to get the exact color that was used in the show. However, if you would like to make your own game board with your own colors, go for it!\nOnce your game board is completely done, save it as a pdf file and send it to your local print shop. At this point you have 2 options.\n1. Print the board on an 18x18 sheet of sticky-backed vinyl ~$25~. This option will last forever and will have little to no fray on the edges. (The guy at the print shop said that it could stop a bullet) -_- smh - doubt it. Also, it is super easy to stick on to the board itself.\n2. Print the board on an 18x18 sheet of regular paper / card stock and mod podge the paper onto the board itself. ~Roughly $15~ This is quite the undertaking to save a couple of dollars. Also, I don't know how well the modpodged paper would react over time.\n* There may be a better option (cost-wise) than what I have presented here, but if money isn't an issue, method 1 is definitely the easy, quality way to go. I personally went with option number 1 and it looks and feels great.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHZ/7XCC/JQGYM1XQ/FHZ7XCCJQGYM1XQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Game Board Design / Printing"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "This step is probably the easiest but the highest stakes step of them all. This stuff is super sticky so if you mess up, the whole thing goes in the garbage. (No pressure right?) With a steady hand and the help of a friend, you should have no trouble getting the print to stick onto the board in a matter of seconds. Peel off the back to expose the adhesive and slowly attach the print to the game board. Take your time and don't mess up :D. There is a good tutorial of how to attach adhesive prints to a game board with finesse (and to make the game board itself if that is something you are interested in doing) here. As you will find in the tutorial, it helps to expose a small section of sticky and attach it right away. Then you can slowly peel the excess away while with your other hand flattening down the printed side onto the board.\nYou are going to need to cut one side and score the other side. The clean cut is on this side : (Picture 2) And the score (cut but not all the way through is (Picture 3))If you cut all the way through this part you will ruin it and will have to start again. Then if you have done it right, it should quad fold like this: (Picture 4) Once you get the game board in hand, where you cut will become more obvious.\nIf I were to do this again however, I would probably invest in a higher quality game board because when it folds up into fourths, as it doesn't lay perfectly flat.

If you have an airbrush, now is the time to use it because painting with acrylic takes forever - which is what I did. One eternity later...\nEscalators: I did a couple base coats of light orange for the majority of the escalators and I did brown for the steps. The color of the steps changed between photos and I thought brown looked the best. For the rails, I mixed brown and yellow to try and create a bamboo look but it wasn't 100% perfect but I think still looks great all things considered.\nEels: This one wasn't too bad. I took a light green and covered the entire eel and added dark green in for the eyes and for the definition of the fins/contour of the body. Also, if you remember from the episode, there is an eel with \"You Lose\" written on it. That is also included in this game and is the dreaded, deadly eel.\nPieces: Again, if you remember from the episode there were two pieces that were orange and white used by Spongebob and Patrick so I painted two pieces orange and white and included the red mouth things and the black eyes. I also made a light blue piece and a red piece so that this could be 4 player game rather than just being limited to 2 people. Be creative and use whatever colors you want.\nDice: The dice are both orange and green with some purple, light and dark green elements to it.

Also, it makes rolling eels and escalators a little more rare and as a result - more exciting.\nI also included 3D printed pieces rather than just drawing it on the board so the pieces could be moved around. This is to ensure a different experience each time you play. You can play around with the sizes of the escalators and eels and the amount you want to use, but I have found 3 escalators and 4 eels is plenty.

We purchased the fantastic Yeti Blue microphone and are very pleased with the quality of the recordings. However, when recording, our offices do not necessarily lend themselves to capturing solid audio. Brick and glass walls, very high ceilings, and any ambient office chatter finds it\u2019s way into the tracks.\nIn order to contain the human voice and block external noise, we built this cheap fix. Based on the full-size vocal booth approach of recording studios, our version sits perfectly on a desktop.\nListen to the audio file attached to this post to hear the difference. The difference is easily noticeable.\n@ :12 mic in the \"vocal booth\"\n@ :36 mic outside the \"vocal booth\"\nBuilding the Desktop Vocal Booth\nMaterials:\nPlastic Storage Box. 12 gal., measuring 19.5\u201d L by 15\u201d W by 137/8\u201d H. With handles. (Target $4.99-$5.99)\nFoam Mattress Topper, Twin Size, 1.5\u201d Thick (Target $14.99)\nVelcro Picture Hanging Strips, 12 pack (OfficeMax $8.99)\nStyrofoam, .5\u201d thick (Randomly found this)\nBeginning with the Styrofoam, I wanted to add a little extra soundproofing at the \u201cback\u201d of the box, which would be the bottom. I also added a layer on one of the long sides, intending the box would sit horizontally. However, during sound testing it was discovered better recordings are achieved when the box sits vertically. So now one side of the box has extra soundproofing!\nI cut the Styrofoam pieces to fit the box, which by the way, makes a total mess. Then, measuring out a piece of the foam mattress topper, I wanted it to wrap around three of the sides in one total piece. After affixing this piece with the stickable Velcro strips, I cut the top and bottom foam mattress pieces and affixed those using the same method. I made sure to add an extra half inch for the foam mattress material when cutting, to ensure filling out any gaps.\nThe nice thing about using a plastic storage box, especially with handles, for a desktop vocal booth is that you can store and carry your microphone and anything else you may need for recording.\nEnjoy!\n--Christopher Winkler", "title": "Super Simple D.I.Y.

Cool idea but too much work for my skill level. So to make thing easier, I built my own with 3 layers of lasercut plywood. I hadn't touched that design in a while, and then I thought about building a blaster. So I took out my original design, refined it, and and designed this blaster around the same system.\nThe 1st picture shows the system as the ready state. The elastics are loaded on and stretch from the back body notches to the front ramp sight. A spring keeps the trigger piece(Blue) pushed full back into the blaster body (Pink).\nThe 2nd picture shows the trigger action activated. The ramps lift the elastics out of the body notches and the tension of the elastics causes them to ride up to the next stop. The top elastic has no stop and slides off towards the front ramp sight. When the triggers is relaxed, the force of the spring+elastic will push the triggerpiece forward, and each of the elastics still on it will be deposited into the next notch up on the body.

A slight turn would take the volume from full to 100% muted.

It consists of a marble-powered plastic computer capable of playing the game of Nim. The machine selects its moves through the action of the marbles falling through the levers of the machine.\nThe \"game board\" is a based on the mechanical Digi-Comp II digital computer (also a Godfrey creation). It has memory switches that hold bits of data. The unit is programmed by lobed levers that affect and are affected by marbles that are released from the top of the game. Three of the levers set the start position. The fourth lever is the 'equalizer' option; if set, the player can win if they play perfectly. The last lever is used to indicate who's turn it is, the human or Dr. Nim's.\nThere are many good online references for the game. The following video is especially informative and entertaining:\nThe Unbeatable Game from the 60s: Dr NIM\nAnd this article speaks to the relevance of a game like Dr. Nim in today's digital world:\nEvil Mad Scientist Laboratories - Dr. Nim\nAlong with the STL files for this project, you will find a PDF of the manual that came with the original Dr. Nim. I brought this file to a local copy center and had them print me a few stapled booklets on glossy paper and was super happy with the results.\nThe Dr. Nim offered here is a 2/3rd scale model of the original (.673 to be precise). This keeps the size of the game down to about 210 mm x 205 mm which will hopefully make Dr. Nim accessible to more 3D printers out there (including mine ;-). I have tried to keep the game as true to the original as possible within the constraints of the differing technologies (FDM vs injection molding) and the information available to me. One other concession was to 3D print the folding stand rather than attempting to employ the wire stand of the original.\nI did not in fact own an original Dr. Nim when I created this model. The model you see here was developed from pictures obtained online, and from pictures and information graciously provided by Dr. Nim owners. Thank you so much Jaap Scherphuis and Charles E. Leiserson!\nRecently I did acquire a vintage Dr. Nim. Upon inspection the only thing I changed was the angle that the game is played at (about 30 degrees) as determined by the Hinge Stoppers.\nDesign Notes\nAs with my other E.S.R. project (Think-a-Dot Replica) the real design work for Dr. Nim happened back in the mid 60's. I just did the modelling. The Amazing Dr. Nim game was mostly modeled in Fusion 360 with some of the simpler pieces done with Tinkercad. What I liked about this project was that once the Base was done, all of the other pieces are quite small and print quickly. This allowed me to iterate and fine tune them with short turn around times.\nThe Amazing Dr. Nim was done as a tribute to John Thomas Godfrey and E.S.R. for their brilliant work many decades ago.

I traced and brought in a simple outline of the state I wanted to start. Check out the outline of the state and round any areas you can so there aren't any sharp points. Remember, this is for kids.\nCreate a background in the size and shape you want (I did a square with rounded corners) and resize your state to fit inside it.\nPut a simple heart in the middle of the state. Make it as big as you can while not making the other pieces have sharp small points around it.\nGoing out from the heart, make lines that go to the edge of the state.\nCheck over the puzzle and the pieces and make sure there aren't any sharp (dagger) points anywhere. If you need to, move and curve lines. What I decided after talking to my husband, is I tried to make it so there were little to no areas where the corner was smaller than 90 degrees. When you get smaller than 90 degrees, you get little stabby daggers.\nPlace your circle cutouts for your dowl as centered in each piece as you can. If you can't do the center, go for the part of the piece with the largest area.\nSome additional notes:\nYou can make as many pieces as you want. I decided I didn't want a lot and I wanted them all to touch the heart. This was a personal preference.\nI also decided to make the lines between pieces relatively straight.

Weisbecker and sold by Education Science Research (E.S.R. Inc.) in the mid to late 60's.\nThink-a-Dot has an upright frame with eight dots on the front face, in rows of three, two, and three. The dots are one of two colors, blue and yellow by convention, that indicate the state of a flip-flop gate inside the frame. There are three openings in the top of the unit through which marbles can be dropped. When a marble travelling through the game encounters a gate, it will both flip the state of the gate (changing it's color), and be deflected to the left or right depending on the initial state of the gate. Marbles drop to the bottom of the frame and are collected in side pockets to be reused.\nYou reset the game to one of two starting positions by tilting the frame to the right or left, so that all the gates face the same way. The four corner gates are colored differently so that they will always be the opposite color of the rest of the dots. Given a particular target pattern of dots, the goal is to drop marbles into the holes at the top until the target pattern is reached in as few moves as possible.\nThere are many very good online references for Think-a-Dot. Here are a few to get you started:\nWikipedia\nJaap's Puzzle Page\nAdafruit\nAlso, along with the STL files for this project, you will find a PDF of the leaflet that came with the original Think-a-Dot. I brought this file to a local copy center and had them print me a few stapled booklets on glossy paper. Super happy with the results.\nThink-a-Dot games are getting rarer by the day. My goal in creating this replica is to help preserve this great little game and honor the creativity of it's inventor.\n\nDesign Notes\nI hesitate to call what I did design. The real design work happened back in the mid 60's. Think-a-Dot was modeled completely with Tinkercad. This is my first substantial modelling effort.\nI was able to get my hands on an original Think-a-Dot as a reference. I tell people that I did the modelling with digital calipers, Tinkercad, and patience. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole process. Tinkercad is a very organic experience and it felt more like sculpting to me than 3D design.\nI started with the Flip Flops. These are a natural for Tinkercad as they are basically made up of cylinders and slabs. The Display piece was done next. When I was satisfied with the result I used the Display as the starting point for the Back piece, extending the edges slightly and adding walls. Finally the Front was made from the Back by removing the holes and marble guides, adding the Display view port, and adjusting the walls while adding the wrap around trim.", "title": "Think-a-Dot Replica", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Think-a-Dot-Replica/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Print Resolution: 0,20 mm and 0.05 mm\nInfill: 100% for all pieces.\nFilament: AMAZ3D and Fused Filament PLA and PETG red and white\nNotes:\nThe Front, Back, and Display pieces can all be printed at 0.20 mm with no supports in PLA.\nI printed the Flip Flops (8 are required) in PETG for added strength at 0.05 mm with supports.\nThe optional Logo was printed at 0.05 mm in PLA.\nThe Display Lines are also optional.

Make connections with cut pieces of wire.\nThis is quirky adaptation is based on Adafruit's Perma-Proto board. https://www.adafruit.com/product/571\nI used GIMP graphics editor to come up with something that would fit on a 1/2\" x 6\" board.\nI experimented with printing it out in various sizes so the holes would match up to the size of the dowels I was going to use.\nGlue the print to the board. I guess you could also print it on sticker paper and then apply to the board. I didn't have any fresh Mod-Podge to use so I just used a thin layer of Tacky glue spread out over the surface.

Paper saturated with liquid glue will tear and wrinkle up forming a bumpy surface.\nCut the board to the length of the print. I added a little excess for a border.\nMake sidepieces to support the board. When the board is lifted a little higher, it gives more room to insert the pieces in the protoboard.\nI used strips of 1/2\"x 3\" to make the sides. A piece of 3/4\" square stock below will brace the board even better. Glue the support strip in place with the board positioned as a spacer for the support strip. Glue the sidepieces to the board after you drill out all the holes.\nSince this will be held in tiny or big hands, I rounded off all the hard edges with my slickplane rounding tool.

Use a bit size to make a nice fitting hole for the dowel you will use as the wire leads.

Larry the LDR (Light Dependent Resistor - used to detect dark/light), his brother Darryl (DHT11 - blue, temp/humidity sensor) and his other brother Darryl (DHT22 - temp/humidity sensor).\nI cut pieces to build up the Adafruit Circuit Playground characters for the wooden block pieces.

The main sections were glued up.\nI used a utility knife to whittle down the top to round it off so I wouldn't need to do as much sanding to finalize the shape.\nThe MOSFET and DHT22 heatsink/mounting plates were the thin popsicle sticks glued on the back of a block of wood.\nUse the drilled protoboard as a jig for gluing in the leads to the components. I used a heavy duty set of snips to cut the thin dowel into small pieces. Use an awl to punch center points of where the leads should go. Drill some short holes that the dowel fits in. Glue and set in place to dry.\nThe bent lead for the resistor was a little more challenging to glue up as they are dowel segments in an L shape.\nThe leads for the 555 also took some work to trim down the dowels a bit at the top of each so it would fit nicely on the IC body in perfect alignment with the holes.\nWhen dry, clip the leads to size and do a final sanding to round over the tips. I found that a pair of wire flush cutters works well in trimming the wood dowels.\nI used my set of permanent markers to color in the components. It gives it the look of a dyed wood instead of a heavy coating of paint. Another use for those markers...\nWhen the wood is saturated with marker ink, give it a chance to dry and watch where you handle it or else you will get marker ink all over your hands.\nI gave everything a protective coat of glue.

I've heard the rule of thumb is if something can fit down a toilet paper tube, it's too small for very small kids to play with. With that in mind, I started with a square that is 2\" by 2.\" Then I just started making more shapes based on the size of that one.\nI knew I had 7 colors of paint, so I decided to do just 7 shapes. You can do more or less. When deciding on shapes, I went with some pretty basic ones that are already on a cardboard puzzle my daughter has: Square, Circle, Triangle, Diamond, Star, Pentagon, and Heart. Some other to consider are Rectangle, Parallelogram, Trapazoid, and Oval (those are the other shapes from the puzzle I already had). Also, get our little one to say parallelogram or trapezoid. It's the cutest!\nI wanted to arrange the shapes as evenly as possible, so in the end, I had them in two rows of two, top and bottom, and a row of three through the middle.\nSomething else to keep in mind when making the shapes is that when possible, make them even. A square and circle are already set, but make sure your star, triangle, diamond, and pentagon can be placed in any way. This will make it easier for your kid. If the shape only fits one way when it looks like it should fit anyway, they might get frustrated. To check if they were even, I would duplicate the shape, change the color and rotate it to make sure it still fit.\nI wasn't sure at first if I wanted thick pieces or pieces with little handles, so I tried both. I had dowels that were 1/4\" wide so I made holes that were just a smidgen smaller than that to cut out. This ended up being a bit too tight, but you can always sand them down if you have the patience. It's good to do test cuts and test the fit before committing.\nOnce I had the shapes in the size I wanted and the arrangement I wanted, I needed the puzzle outline. I decided to use a rectangle with rounded corners to make it safer for kids to handle. My puzzle ended up being about 8\" by 7.5\" but it's not exactly that. To save on cuts and space, I put the puzzle back right next to it and deleted one of the overlapping lines.\nTime to cut!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8G/E0E1/JPN3M0ZT/F8GE0E1JPN3M0ZT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3N/D2HV/JPN3LXKW/F3ND2HVJPN3LXKW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGX/V6Z3/JPN3M11H/FGXV6Z3JPN3M11H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHF/SL2L/JPN3M106/FHFSL2LJPN3M106.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Design"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Time to cut your design. If you are using woodworking tools, have at it! I don't have any experience so I can't really give advice, but if you have them already, you know how to use them.\nBefore laser cutting, cover the front and back of your wood with tape. I originally didn't cover the back and it got burn marks. I say, just cover them both just in case.\nPut your wood in the cutter and cut! Your settings are going to vary depending on your cutter but with my Glowforge Pro 45 Watt Laser Cutter, I used the settings: Thickness .125\" / Speed 170 / Power Full.\nAlways do test cuts, but I actually got my information in the Glowforge forums.\nSince I wanted to try both peg pieces and thicker pieces, I put holes in the pieces I cut with the puzzle board and then did sperate pieces on 1/4\" Birch plywood. If you only have one size of wood, another option is just cut two sets of the pieces and glue them on top of each other. I used the other size simply because I already had it.\nCutting the dowel can be kind of weird. You can just cut it with woodworking tools, but I decided to go for it with the laser. I was able to easily cover it with a normal roll of masking tape, then I taped it in place in my cutter. I did some test cuts and when I had the settings I wanted, I just cut lines across it.

I wanted something really boxy. After looking at what was already on my computer and looking on free font sites, I found Pro Lamina. I ended up having to do editing on the font to get it the way I wanted it, but it was a great font to get me going. Some edits I made included: making all the letters square, giving the \"I\" lines on the top and bottom, and making the middle of the W reach the top. This was just for rainbow and edits were made on a letter by letter basis. (By the time I reached the end of this project, those edits may not have been necessary, but I'm still happy with them.)\nNow that I had the font, I needed to get the individual letters into Tinkercad. I used Silhouette Studio because it's a program I'm very familiar with. I took each letter individually and did any minor alterations I wanted. When it was ready I exported it as a PNG, used an online site to make it an SVG, then brought it into Tinkercad.\nTo get myself started, I got all the letters for RAINBOW and started arranging them to get an idea of what I was working with. After doing some initial setups, it seem liked stacking the letters was going to make for the best setup.\nLooking at it, I wanted the letters to stand out more, so using the same method Jon-A-Tron used when making a name keychain, I decided every other letter would stand up a bit more than the one next to it. For every word, it would start with a raised letter, then the second would be shorter, third higher, etc. I made the letters .1\" different in height.\n(After tests) I decided the \"details\" of the letters would only go down about 1/4\" deep so they wouldn't go all the way through. As much as I wanted the holes in the letters to go all the way through, it just wasn't going to work out. I also decided the holes should go in at a slight angle to make it easier for the 3D print (and eventually the crayon) to come out of the mold. To make the holes have an angle, I created a cutout separately that went in on the bottom (instead of just going straight down) just using basic shapes (second image below). I filled in the hole in the letter so that there was no hole at all, and lined up my new hole cut out where the old holes used to be (third image below). My cutouts were a little messy but as long as they sliced right, I left them.\nAt this point well change the full size of the letter. We need to do this in order to fill the mold with crayons as they will melt down to the size we want. (After tests) I decided to full depth of the highest letter would be 1 1/4\".\n\nLastly, I needed to overlap some of the letters because for some reason they didn't import perfectly. So what I would do is group the letters, export, bring into slicer, and make sure it acted like the letters were attached to each other. Sometimes they would have a slight slight gap making the infill funny. If that happened I noted where the mistakes were and went back to Tinkercad to make changes.\nI repeated this for all the words until I had all the colors of the rainbow! (I did PURPLE instead of doing either Indigo or Violet. I grew up with purple so I just did purple.)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9P/D93X/JPCY48OH/F9PD93XJPCY48OH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Design - Prepping Letters"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "This is straightforward, but be prepared if you are going to print all these words, it takes about 1/4lb of filament and 6 or more hours.\nAlso, don't be too stingy on the infill.

To be safe, my final prints had 15% infill.\nI don't think you'll need a skirt.

Lay out some wax paper. It's nicer to work on than whatever surface you have.\nSo this stuff is really easy and fun to use BUT you only have about 3 minutes to use it once the two parts touch. Do no dawdling here.\nI found it best to work in small amounts while I filled in holes and cracks and then worked in bigger amounts later.\nSo to start, take an equally small amount of each putty and quickly mix them together. (When I first tried this, I actually used a kitchen scale to weigh it to make sure the amounts were even. The more I did this the less I felt I had to, but it can be helpful when you get started.) Mix until the color is uniform, but try to not take any more than 1 minute. That leaves you with 2 more minutes.\nTake your small amount and roll it snake-like. Shove it as firmly as you can into the holes on the top of the letters. Really smash it in there and make sure it overflows. You want the mold as solid as it can be despite working in small amounts so make sure your putty overflows over the top of the letter (Image 5).\nContinue mixing and filling holes. Don't forget the crevices along the sides of and between some of the letters. You don't want to accidentally partially fill it and not be able to fix it/fill it in later.\nOnce all of the holes and crevices are filled, you can mix bigger amounts and cover the rest of the letter. Make sure you get all the sides and top but leave the flat bottom exposed. Pay particular attention to edges as it's easy to push the molding putty around it and miss it.\nThe mold doesn't have to be super thick, you just need it sturdy.\nI found if I accidentally mixed too much putty while working on one word, I'd use it on the next one, but once you reach the last word you have to use up all the putty you've mixed up.\nWhen your mold is ready, I recommend setting it on its bottom as it needs to be able to stand up on its own in the oven.\nGive the mold time to set. It needs to set about 30 minutes but you can always give it more to be safe.\nWhen it has set, carefully pry the 3D print out of the putty. Don't rush yourself. It is best to carefully pry the sides off one at a time. Then starting at either the top or bottom of the word, work the word out of the putty. You don't want to pry out those little bits in the holes.

I think I've made three blue ones now.)\nPreheat your oven to 200 degrees F.\nNow that you have your molds, it's time to make crayons! But how many crayons do you need? Well, after all my tests I keep mentioning, I've figured it out for you (here is where a scale comes in handy again).\nIf you want to make a crayon that is made up of letters that are .625\" squared you need about 3.5grams per letter (also, more is better than less). For your information, 1 Crayola crayon is 5 grams.\nSo, for the word BLUE, you need about 14 grams of crayon or 2.8 crayons worth.\nPrep your crayons by getting the paper off. I've had some issues with this and the best results I got were when I firmly cut along the length of the wrapper. I really cut into the crayon. Then the paper should peel right off.\nNext, cut your crayons up. The smaller the pieces, the more the color will blend when melted. So, cutting it into about 4 pieces is good. I wouldn't go smaller unless you have to.\nNow put the crayons in the mold. Group same color pieces together so you can have blocks of color when done.\nPeople melt crayons anywhere from 200 degrees to 250. I would say you wouldn't need to go higher than that.\nAt 200 degrees it seemed to take at least 20 minutes to melt. You need to keep an eye on it because as soon as it is all melted, get it out of there. The longer it sits in the oven melted, the longer it has for colors to bleed and blend together.\nIf you melt more than one crayon at a time, be careful, they may take different amounts of time and once one is all melted, you want to get it out of the oven.\nOnce melted, take it out and let it harden completely! This process has been done over and over again and to get the best results with your homemade mold and crayon, let it harden and cool and then move onto the next step. It's not as easy as just popping it out.\nAlso, once you take it out, if you see any bubbles, especially big ones, I suggest carefully popping them with a toothpick.

Dwarf and Elf are always speaking about something and using this dialogs and drawings in book you need to solve riddles. My story is not too long and it has just 3 puzzles. Each paragraph of a new puzzle starts with ancient Scandinavian runes. To solve each riddle you must interact with the book. For example, in the first paragraph wayfarers lost their direction and decided that they had went to the opposite side. So you should change direction by rotating a circle on the cover of the book. There are three LEDs, which are hidden under translucent stones on the cover. If you\u2019ve solved a paragraph, then a LED turns on. In the second quest you need to solve Sudoku and discover a phrase that says: \u201cRotate book\u201d. So you need to rotate the book, holding it vertically. In the third quest you need to put chess figures on right checks. When everything is behind and you have solved all ancient secrets, you can get your deserved price)))0 The part of the book, which couldn\u2019t be opened, will make some noise (it means that servo opens a latch).

I will usually test the paint on my finger before applying it to the minature.

What about a 3D Pentominoes Puzzle? You are missing out if you haven't! Young or old, there are plenty of challenges to puzzle over with these 12 simple pieces. Each pentomino is a unique shape, made up of 5 connected squares. You are welcome to spend all day looking up the background, mathematics, and other magical properties of pentominoes (Pentominoes on wikipedia), OR you can keep reading to see how to make your own set and the many challenges and solutions there are!\n(If you already have a pentominoes set and want to view the many different challenges and solutions, skip down to the last step!)\nI was introduced to a simple plastic 2D pentominoes set while on vacation with lots of extended family, and remember everyone trying their hand at just getting the pieces back in the box. It was challenging and so fun! Everyone wanted a turn! I just had to make one. So, I found a basic explanation and plan to get me started here. Then I went at it, delving into other tips and tricks of woodworking along the way. This turned out to be a major upgrade from the regular flat sets as these pieces are made out of cubes instead of squares! And for the puzzle enthusiast, like me, this opened up an entire new world of very challenging 3D possibilities. I decided to write this Instructable since when I was making this I couldn\u2019t find a simple, thorough explanation of how to go about making these! Hope you enjoy!\nFor those with a 3D printer, here is the link to a Tinkercad project for the Basic Pentominoes. Each pentomino is 1 inch cubed, so to get the right sizing, I understand you would scale between 60-70%.

Explaining how each of the pieces is cut, rotated, and combined at first seemed like a daunting task. However, Tinkercad (a simple online 3D modeling tool) came to the rescue! This is my first time using the program, but I was able to quickly model the pieces, the configurations, and the cuts and rotations to show how they are each formed and go together. Also, at the end of the instructable I used Tinkercad to show all the possible challenges and many of the solutions (Even 3D solutions!).\nIn the pictures you will see how each of the 12 pieces is made up of multiple rectangles, 1 - 5 units long. Since I was making mine out of wood, I tried to keep the grain and color of each piece as consistent as possible, so I've included the diagram of how I cut the pieces from the same wood stock and rotated them to form each pentomino. This will make more sense in the next steps.\nIf I owned a 3D printer I could have just printed my Tinkercad model and been done! However, since I was creating a wood set I needed the tools, materials and a plan to make it happen. First, I laid out one of the many 6x10 solutions to the puzzle and decided which type of wood I would use for each piece.

I chose 6 different kinds of hardwood boards for the puzzle pieces, so each pentominoes set could have 2 pieces in each color. Most local hardware stores carry multiple types of hardwood boards sold by the linear foot, so just pick the ones you want. Looking back I may have tried some different hardwood dealers or a Rockler store so there would be even more variety. The extra expense wouldn't have been too much since it is not a lot of wood.\nNote: Each of these boards will seem much duller in color and luster at the store and during the creation process! The real pop comes from the clear wood gloss finish. You can see the difference in the picture of the 12 sets above where only the one had been sprayed with the finish, making the colors just pop!\nHere are the types of boards I used:\nWalnut (dark color)\nCherry (red color)\nHickory (white color)\nPoplar (yellow color)\nOak (light brown color)\nKnotty Alder (brown color)\nPuzzle Pieces:\nTo make the pieces, you need 1 x 2 hardwood boards (Actual 0.75 in by 1.5 in). These will be cut in half at the beginning of the project, so you could use 1 x 1 boards if you can find them. One puzzle only needs 2 feet of 1 x 2 board for the 12 pieces. Since I got carried away making 12 of these sets as Christmas presents for family, I used a total of 24 feet of 1 x 2 boards (6 types of wood each 1 x 2 x 4 feet).\nNote: If making only 1 set with 6 different colors you may have to buy extra wood since you'd need just 4 inches of 1 x 2 in each color.\nPuzzle Box:\nIt is easier to make the pieces first and then size the box to fit the pieces. For the sides of the box I used one of the cheaper hardwoods above (Knotty Alder) and needed a little over 1 foot for the four sides (1 x 2 x 14 in). Again, the 1 x 2 will be cut in half (I actually cut even thinner), giving 28 total inches since the sides are about 8 in by 5 in totaling 26 inches of board.

I would highly recommend taking a scrap piece of 1 x 2 (about 2 feet) and trying the methods suggested start to finish. The hardest part of building this puzzle is that the dimensions of the pieces need to be consistent, so it is best to make any mistakes in practice first. I won't explain how to build the prototype as I followed the same methods with the finished product and it would be repetitive. Instead I'll give a few major lessons learned from the prototype, then explain the details in the next steps.\nAll the boards will need to be planed to the thickness of the thinnest piece. Once you've cut the 1 x 2 boards in half, if one has a thin side, that will have to be the size you plane each square down to for consistency.\nWhen cutting the blocks with a miter saw, you need to develop a good method for holding the pieces (especially when cutting the single unit cubes) or it will kick out and could get damaged. I used a scrap piece of wood about 8 inches with a straight notch cut out of one end to hold the blocks during each cut.\nUsing the miter saw it is best to use a sharp blade and cut slowly through the block to prevent splitting on the back of the piece. I also suggest replacing the miter slot with 1/4 inch MDF to prevent tear-out on the bottom of the pieces (explained later).\nThe \"U\" piece is the only piece with a slot where other pieces will be inserted, and so the 2 side sections will need to be slightly shorter to allow for other pieces to fit. (This will be explained in more detail later)\nPlanning each piece separately and which cuts (how many units) you need to make it, will prevent cutting single units and then realizing you actually need only 2 unit and 3 unit sizes for that piece.\nWhen cutting the pieces, the best way to preserve the grain and the color is to cut each block needed from the same board one right after another so you get the most similar color and grain. If you are doing multiple sets and cut all the single units of a piece one right after another, then all the multiple unit sizes for the piece, it will lead to greater variations in the wood and make the blocks harder to match up since they are from different locations on the original board.\nUsing tape helps keep the pieces oriented correctly and together until they are glued. (More on this in the next steps)\nI used a router on the edges/sides of the pieces (as seen in my prototype), and it was a flop! It was harder to build the 3D puzzles and didn't look or turn out like I hoped.

I ran each board through a table saw to split them down the length. This should give you approximately 3/4 in by 3/4 in square lengths of wood.\nNext, all the pieces of wood should be planed to the same thickness so they are perfectly square. For this, you need to determine the thickness of your thinnest piece and plane the rest to that size or smaller. I went with a thickness of about 11/16 inches (or 0.6875 inches) which was slightly thinner than my smallest board width. This thickness will determine the overall size of the puzzle - at 11/16 in the overall box is about 8 x 5 inches. I thought that was a perfect size, but you could go a little smaller or bigger if desired.\nNot owning a planer myself, I used my mounted router with a 1/2 in straight flute bit, a tightly clamped board as a fence, and shaved 2 sides of each board to make each board square to the same thickness. I set the fence a distance of 0.68 inches away from the edge of the bit (the width of my smallest board) and did not move the fence the whole time. The router is shaving off the side of the board opposite the fence. To do this right I used a featherboard to hold the board tight against the fence. If there was only a small amount to take off on that board\u2019s width I would have the bit fully extended, but when a more significant amount needed removing I started with the bit only part way out and made multiple passes extending the bit further up each time. This way I wasn\u2019t taking off too much at one time, making it easier on my router. Once I shaved each side I ran it through again to make sure it was as clean as possible.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ5/GQCH/JP8Z7H0C/FQ5GQCHJP8Z7H0C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGE/7KAR/JP8Z7H3T/FGE7KARJP8Z7H3T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJH/RB5O/JP8Z7H8A/FJHRB5OJP8Z7H8A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJH/J4B3/JP8Z7HCG/FJHJ4B3JP8Z7HCG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Preparing the Wood Strips"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "At this point it is best to run an extra scrap length of board through the table saw and planer or router to get it to the same thickness as the other boards, so you can cut it up to use as spacers. I cut 5 pieces of this scrap board each about 4 inches to start.\nTo setup the saw, put the 5 spacers (my scrap was not square so I marked the side with the correct width) side by side up to the left side of the miter saw blade. Carefully clamp a 1 x 2 board to the rail on the left side of the 5 pieces, making it 5 units away from the blade. This will be your stop block and should not be moved for the duration of the project.\nNext, to cut the length of each spacer, put a single width spacer up against the board and cut one of the spacers to a 4 unit length, labeling it. Then, put two width spacers up against the stop block and cut another spacer to a 3 unit length. Do the same to make a 2 unit length. You don't really need the 1 unit length since the width of any of the spacers is 1 unit. Now with the spacers in hand, you will be able to use them in the same method to cut the right lengths of rectangles to create each pentomino shape.\nNote: Replacing the miter saw slot with a smaller 1/4 inch MDF board will reduce the possibility of tear-out from the back of the pieces when cutting them.

As you cut each piece, simply put the right size spacer up against the stop block, place your board snug against the spacer, then clamp the board in place on the right side of the miter saw (you may add another spacer on top of the board on the right side as shown to make it easier to clamp). For the long straight pentomino, no spacer is used, simply cut to 5 units length. I advise starting with the simplest pentominoes made up of only 2 pieces, then working to the harder ones.\nNote: Again, it is important to hold the piece being cut (especially the smaller pieces) with a scrap piece of wood otherwise it can move around or kick out, damaging it.\nFor example, for the plus (or X) piece, put the 4 spacer on the stop block and cut a single unit cube. Set this off to side not disturbing the position from which it was cut. Next, put a single width spacer on the stop block and cut the 3 unit length piece. Place this together with the other piece in the same orientation it was in on the original board. Repeat again cutting a single unit cube and set next to the others. This will help to best matching the grain and color of the pieces when assembling because you simply rotate the pieces to form the pentomino as shown. Use masking tape to keep the pieces together in the original grain directions and positions until they can be assembled.\nNote: If any of the pieces need to be trimmed slightly smaller (such as the \"U\" pentomino), rather than moving the stop block you can add business cards or cardstock between the stop block and spacer piece as shown to shorten it. Again, this is necessary for the \"U\" pentomino otherwise the gap will be too small to insert other pieces!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKN/W7TB/JP8Z7HTS/FKNW7TBJP8Z7HTS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPE/883E/JP8Z7HXO/FPE883EJP8Z7HXO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ6/XV54/JP8Z7HQ8/FQ6XV54JP8Z7HQ8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDG/WWCU/JPN3M9TO/FDGWWCUJPN3M9TO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Cutting the Pieces"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Once your pieces are cut, rotate them into place, lining up grains as best as possible.

Apply wood glue using cardstock or a business card, spreading a small layer evenly on the surface of the smaller piece. Put it in position against the other piece (using spacers), hold for a few seconds, then carefully clamp with a spring clamp.\nNote: A little glue goes a long way! Adding too much glue so it comes out the sides is not what you want and makes the cuts more noticeable! Even a small amount of glue when dried will make it so they cannot be pried apart.\nNote: It is best to clamp just 2 pieces together at a time even if the pentomino is made up of more than two pieces. Let the first 2 pieces dry for a few minutes, then clamp the 3rd piece on. (Being careful to remember how the 3rd piece is oriented in relation to the first two is tricky, but you can use a small piece of tape to mark this.)\nNote: The 8 brand new spring clamps I bought for this project left some sort of oily residue on some of my prototype pieces that soaked in and wouldn't sand off!

The first, is the classic style of gameplay, which involves the waste paper basket being turned upside down and the base of the basket becoming a build ring for various styles of paper towers.\n2. The second, as intended style of gameplay, utilises the waste paper basket in its intended upright position. The games then utilise the interior of the basket, as well as, the previously prepared paperclips.\n3. The third, caged style of gameplay, flips the waste paper basket on its head yet again; however, the game takes place under and within the confines of the basket. This style also utilises the previously prepared paperclips.\nTerminology:\nSimple Tower: A tower made up of a single column of pieces stacked one on top of another.\nComplex Tower: A tower built upon a base of multiple pieces that has many pieces per stacked level.\nBuild Ring: The bottom of the waste paper basket that when flipped over, serves as a lipped platform onto which towers are built.\nInstruction Cards: Cards that provide the building criteria for the various types of paper towers, rules of gameplay per round, and point attributions.\nPiece sizes: Small. (1\u2019\u2019 x 2\u2019\u2019) Medium. (2\u2019\u2019 x 2\u2019\u2019 ) Large. (3\u2019\u2019 x 3\u2019\u2019 )\nPoint Calculation: A player receives a point for every round won.

I could use my 1 x 30 belt sander to make an ornate, all be it rustic but somewhat ornate handle for the wand if I used smaller/thinner belts. I have used this method in the past to sand small metal pieces or really tight spots before but I just never tried or thought about contouring wood with a thin sanding belt.\nWhile this may not be anything new to some of you I do have to admit I feel very clever for thinking this up.

I rolled the gingerbread dough out between two sticks on the floured work top to make it very level.

I also kept them in their square formation which meant they fused together again while cooking but I cut them with my kitchen knife inmediately after taking them out of the oven. Lastly, when cooled, I filed the cookies down on the grater (the side of the grater that's only good for scraping your knuckles) to level them completely.

I was able to find a PDF online of all 76 cards. I then formatted it so that every other page had the back to it and then I printed it at Staples. I requested 110lb cardstock and lamination. Make sure that the lamination is the kind that fuses to the paper, otherwise, when you cut them out, the lamination will come apart.\nTo cut the cards out I used a laser cutter. This was mainly to get used to using the technologies in our lab, so if you do not have a laser cutter available, cutting with scissors will work fine as well. Doing it with the laser cutter did make the cards all the same size and gave the cards a more worn look on the edges which I am pleased with.

For example, in the body shoulders joint, the male cylinder is fixed on the body, the female (let's say the hole) is made inside the shoulders \"stick\".\nNot to allow the stick-shoulders to slip off, I added two flares that prevent any movement on the vertical axis (in reality, a minimum amount of movement is allowed by the gap).\nThe lower part of the body is designed to work as mechanical endstop for rotation between body/shoulders and body/legs.\nThe head\nThe head is printed separately and its design has been challanging because I wanted it to rotate but not along all 360\u00b0 because, since the pivot is placed on the lower part and the upper one is heavier, a completely free rotation would have led to find the head often upside down.\nAfter various tests, I found that the best solution was to provide the body of a fixed pin and print the rotation system directly in the head. The joint is similar to the others but with the addition of a small \"stick\" in the male part and an extension of the hole in the upper part of the female.

That first puzzle was a two-layer design like this one, but even less complicated as we where hand cutting the plywood with a coping saw. That and my son had the attention span of 6 year old.\nAs I began writing this Instructable I researched if this puzzle had been introduced on Instructables before and it has. I found two examples: One made of Cardboard and one of laser cut acrylic, and both published by \u201ckiteman\u201d back in 2006.\nThe nice thing about this project is that you can make it as simple or as complex as you desire. It can be made of many materials: cardboard, wood, plastic, etc. It can be one level or as many levels as you wish and the material can be transparent or not. My puzzle was designed to solve blind and to not see the coin from the time it enters the puzzle until it leaves the exit. However I ran out of blue filament and finished the top with a semi-transparent filament. So you can see enough to help solve the puzzle.

So as simple as this maze seems it can be a complicated puzzle to solve.\nOnce I decided on how many levels to make I grabbed some grid paper to work out the dimensions and design layout. As I said this is the second time that I made one of these puzzles, so I already had ideas and experience to draw from so it did not take long at all to put pencil to paper. I measured a US dime so that I knew how big my channels needed to be. I chose 20 mm to allow easy movement of the coin within the puzzle and about 2 mm channel height.\nBecause I hit pretty close initially on the scale of my drawings to the dimensions of my 3D printer's build platform it was very easy to transfer these from drawings to Tinkercad for the design phase.

I do know to that I will have to provide a solutions map for the \"cube\" if it ever does get printed as it is much to complicated to \"solve\" from memory. I added a by-pass to this design that can be blocked off to take it out of play. This by-pass allows the puzzle to be solved with just 5 levels of play. I will make a plug to insert into the exit slot to take it out of play. I added the bypass because I thought it would be fun to solve the puzzle in a few quick moves and then hand it off to someone to spend hours or days solving. I also will print this one in a semi-transparent material so that it can at least be seen what level the coin currently is on, otherwise I believe that it would be nearly unsolvable and require just pure luck to exit the coin.\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or comments.\nThank you, Schockmade.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMD/TO0G/JOWSTYCD/FMDTO0GJOWSTYCD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8I/7HW9/JOWSTYBY/F8I7HW9JOWSTYBY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2I/3EU4/JOWSTYBE/F2I3EU4JOWSTYBE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWN/WT84/JOWSTYBT/FWNWT84JOWSTYBT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIF/9EKV/JOWTJT5B/FIF9EKVJOWTJT5B.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Conclusion and Bonus Material"}], "channel": "Puzzles"}, {"category": "Play", "description": "Puzzles are meant to fun and challenging, but there are only so many puzzles and when you see the same puzzle over and over again it gets boring especially when you know how to do it.

I wanted to run my grandfather\u2019s trains so I had to design it in such a way that I could operate both DC and DCC (computer chip trains). I decided on an oval for the DC, and inside that another oval for the DCC. To make it a bit more interesting, I added a figure eight on the inside of that. With a bit of thinking, I linked everything together to make it work well.\nI wanted it to be portable so decided to keep the layout to the size of a single door (2000mmx820mm) 78.74x32.2inch.\nBuild:\nThe frame of the bench work I built with 92mm x 22mm (3.6x0.86inch) Pine and added 22mm x 22mm (0.86x0.86inch) battens on the inside to make it stronger, but still fairly light.\nOn top of that I glued 20mm (0.78inch) sheet foam (Styrofoam) so that I had a base to work on.\nI then cut out the footprint of the track in sections using 20mm (0.78inch) sheet foam (Styrofoam). I used Woodland Scenics 2% inclines from the subterrain layout system to get to the heights I required for the two bridges.\nOnce all the base work was done, I could start with the track work. I used the flex Code 80 track from Peco. All the points are also from Peco with SEEP point motors. I also did all the wiring so that I could operate a train. I was quite impressed; it was starting to come together nicely.\nLandscaping Design & Build:\nI knew from the start that I wanted a mountain on the one side, my town would go in the loop of the eight. The Station would be in the middle front. Now I need to make this all work.\nI once again used 20mm (0.78inch) sheet foam (Styrofoam) and cut out the profile of the mountain. I build it as ribs which I connected to each other with small flat sections of foam. To give it a strong base I saw that Woodland Scenics has a plaster cloth so I decided to make my own. I bought a roll of cloth bandage at the pharmacy and cut it in about 200mm (7.8inch) lengths. Then in place of plaster or hydrocal, I used cretestone. I made up a very watery mixture of cretestone and soaked the pieces of cloth bandage in it. Then I laid the pieces of cloth randomly over the foam structure.\nI also made my own rocks, I bought the Woodland Scenics rubber moulds and with the cretestone mixture I cast my own. As for painting, I mixed three different colour browns to my liking and the darkest (very runny) I painted as the base colour. I let the excess of paint run down to create darker parts. I dry brushed the two lighter browns over that to create a realistic look. For the field or grass sections I painted a thick layer of earthy coloured paint, and while it was still wet, I sprinkled the Woodland Scenics grass over it. I then used the Woodland Scenics cement in a spray can to glue the grass onto the layout and give it a realistic matt finish. The waterfall and river was also created with the Woodland Scenics Water Effects and Realistic Water. All the trees and bushes are from the Woodland Scenics range.\nBuildings Town and Other:\nI bought the station first (kit from Faller). Then I started to look for houses and other buildings to create the town. I tried to stay around Era III. I did not want to recreate a specific place, so I bought whatever I liked. The layout of the houses is similar to that on the box. I liked it so I tried to replicate it on my layout. I also wanted to add a windmill as both my parents were born in Holland. The cars and people are mostly also all from the Woodland Scenics range. Houses are fitted with LED lights and the street lights are from the Viesmann range.\nExtra Detail and Maintenance:\nI like to do detail, so there are lots of small little details on the layout that make it interesting to look at. Even I can sit for hours and just watch while my trains pass through my layout. Currently I\u2019m busy finishing the catenary from Vollmer and I\u2019m still busy adding the powerlines to the houses. Then there is always a tree or a bush somewhere or just a little bit of paint that can be added to just finish it off better, or to make it look a little bit more realistic.", "title": "LooVille ModelRailroad", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/LooVille-ModelRailroad/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I used 92mm x 22mm Pine for the frame and 22mm x 22mm Pine for the bracing.

If you do it correctly, you will be able to just wedge the LED board without the need for glue. Now cut of the original power source connector of the LED board, also cut the power source connector of the airplane controller board just like the picture. Now soldering the red wires together, shrink wrap, and do the same for the ground wire. One might ask why are we going to such a length and not just use 2 battery instead. A simple answer would be for the look, a more complicated answer is battery bay limitation, extra connector, extra weight, etc. One of the most important steps is testing the system before glue everything down, you do not want to find out the LED does not light up after the assembly. When you start gluing everything down you want to make sure all the LED light secure where they suppose to be, then you can secure the LED board. Remember at this point, the LED board on the top is attaching to the airplane control board on the bottom. Making sure you take time running the wires, the more time you gave it, the better it looks at the end, and the better it flies.

To a beginner, this means your airplane has the latest tech, it is very simple to fly, with very simple parts, no control surface needed.

By pushing two wires through the ball and connecting the second speaker in parallel I got an even louder sound. I had a damaged mp3 player so I just used the speaker and case to hold it in place. If you want to experiment with that you could just use a protected speaker in a case.\nTotal cost was about $13.00.

Chicken out now and buy some on the internet and wait ages for them to arrive.\nOn the other hand if the cost of freight or the convenience or just the sheer joy of making your own appeals to you read on.\nMost commercially made zither pins have a square head and microthreads so in theory they can be screwed in though most sets of instructions say they should be driven in. I have seen however a few Asian long zithers (Koto Guzheng etc) that had flat ended zither pins.\nBecause I live far from the centers of zither fashion and manufacture (mostly because most Aussie rock and roll bands fail to make best use of the zither in their repertoire) I had a choice between making my own or getting way too many at a reasonable per pin price or paying way too much for too few and waiting weeks for them to arrive.\nI first experimented with a few nails I had laying around in my shed. To form them I used a highly technical cold forging process dating back to the earliest recording of blokes in sheds. I hit it with a hammer to flatten the end. When doing this it is vital that you wear safety glasses and hold the pin firmly (preferably with locking pliers). I used my brickie's club hammer held steady with a clamp on a bid of scrap MDF on a rug as an improvised anvil. It would be really easy to damage your floor doing this.\nThen I used the smallest drill bit in my set (1.6 mm) to make holes I could feed the string through. Pretty much every nail I tried worked except that the galvanised nails had to have the oxidised zinc dust sanded off before they would hold. Unfortunately I didn't have enough sufficiently large nails that I was happy with so I was forced to go to my local hardware store and spend about $6 on a 50 pack of 100 mm by 3.75 mm bullet head bright nails. after cutting off the heads and tips and cutting them in half each nail yielded two 45 mm long zither pins at a cost of about 5 cents each, less than 10% of the cheapest price I could find on the interweb. The hole these fit into needs to be the size down so they will be a tight fit. These were 3.75 mm in diameter so I drilled a 3 mm hole to mount them.\nTake a bit more time than I did to keep the ends uniform thickness and length of flattening and the holes in the end a uniform length from the end.\nSeeing I was lacking a microthread tap and die I put concentric grooves around the pin by bending a bit of 60 grit sandpaper over the pin and gripping it tight with my fingers and twisting it in one direction for a while. The purpose of the microthreads is to increase the surface area and increase the friction zone on the pins. It also removes any lubricant left over from the manufacturing process.\nIf you make the grooves along the length of the pin it will start off having even more friction but it will ream out the hole when you turn it eventually resulting in no friction. So don't do that.\nYou will make your job easier later on if you level off and flatten the tops of your zither pins now.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2U/MU2Y/JN4VGIR1/F2UMU2YJN4VGIR1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLJ/7VFX/JN4VGMLV/FLJ7VFXJN4VGMLV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX2/WR4E/JN4VGMLW/FX2WR4EJN4VGMLW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLR/VOMA/JN4VGMLA/FLRVOMAJN4VGMLA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0C/OW5O/JN4VGINM/F0COW5OJN4VGINM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Get or Make Some Zither Pins"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Because I made my own pins with flat rather than square ends I could not use one of the special square ended spanners that you need for regular zither pins. I could however use a regular shifting spanner. However this was a suboptimal solution and I had to sticky tape it into position so it didn't wobble about and it was a little orkward. A better quality shifting spanner or pair of locking pliers would also have been better.\nSo I decided to make myself a proper twister spannery key thingy. All I needed was a T shaped thingey with a slot in the end right? After a bit of thinking and a digging through my spare odds and sods I used a spare bolt I had laying around and (after a bit of trial and error and mucking about) eventually took three hacksaw blades taped together to achieve the correct width to cut a slot in the head of the bolt. Because I had the bolt firmly held in a vice, the taped together blades were actually quite easy to hold together and cut the slot with. I wish I had worked that out the first time I tried to cut it because after all the fiddling about the slot in the end of mine is not as neat as it could have been. For a handle any nice piece of hardwood cut to fit your hand should be fine.\nMy initial attempt at using a couple of nuts to lock the bolt into place on the handle was woefully inadequate so I used my advance tecknolowloderodgy knockometer to flatenate the end of the bolt in the same manner as I had for the zither pins. A small chisel widened the original handle hole sufficiently to take the flatenated end of the bolt and a bit of sticky tape closed off the end of the hole and the hole was filled with epoxy that had been thickened with sawdust. The purpose of the nut purposely wound on the inside of the flatenated bit was so there would be a horizontal I could rest the bolt on in the epoxy filled hole to ensure it stayed vertical. Mine fitted so well I didn't actually need it but you might so don't forget it or find a different way of holding it vertical. I'm sure a couple of strips of masking tape over the top or a bit of bent wire or even just a clothes peg, a nail and a block of wood would do the job.\nFinish off by removing the tape sanding the wood down and make it look pretty and smooth to the touch with a coat of shellac or varnish or whatever you have handy.\nYou don't have to make this but once you get round to tightening up 15 or so Zither pins and retuning for the 20th time you'll be mighty glad you have the right tool.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZE/2S4N/JN4VGMML/FZE2S4NJN4VGMML.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ4/Y22Y/JN4VGX0X/FJ4Y22YJN4VGX0X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEH/WIAT/JN4VGMM8/FEHWIATJN4VGMM8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN9/LROR/JN4VGMM9/FN9LRORJN4VGMM9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7Q/Q1LI/JN4VGMMA/F7QQ1LIJN4VGMMA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXB/DM60/JN4VGMMB/FXBDM60JN4VGMMB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB4/Y7D9/JN4VGMN7/FB4Y7D9JN4VGMN7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHK/CM4D/JN4VGMN8/FHKCM4DJN4VGMN8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: If You Made Your Pins You Will Need Something to Twist Them With"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Spacing of the zither pins at the top was around 15mm but Because I was planning on a low end straight bridge I worked out a 14mm spacing would make the strings at that end just marginally closer allowing the soundboard to bridge contact to be optimised.\nAs I stated before I made these zither pins 3.75 mm in diameter and they are 45 mm long so a small block of wood 15 mm thick with a 6 mm wide hole through it is perfect for making sure I drive the pins to a uniform 30 mm depth.\nThe hammering in process will round the edges of some of the pins so be prepared to even them up with a file.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOS/NJLF/JN4VH4VW/FOSNJLFJN4VH4VW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVW/XW5C/JN4VH4VU/FVWXW5CJN4VH4VU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Work Out Where the Holes Should Be and Drive Your Zither Pins In"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "I got lazy here and used 3 mm thick pine handy ply rather than resawing and jointing some more pine for the back.

Other options include hardwood or plastic or bone inlays and eyelets of the sort used for shoelace holes etc. You don't need to do this but I think it looks better.\nOther ways of holding the strings at the fixed end are many and varied ranging from tying them to steel or wooden pegs to having slots and knots or a mounting bar. Feel free to make up your own style.\nI initially tried it with a bridge only at the straight end but after fiddling trying to get the strings at one level I decided to make one for the curvy end.

I have heard people on the internet talking about using a single string gauge for all strings. The 100lb fishing line would probably have been a good compromise if the bass end had been a bit longer.\nTo speed up the settling in process, tug on the loose ends of the strings to tighten the knots and hit them with a spot of clear nail varnish or super glue to minimise slippage.\nBecause of the high angle of the curve in the top bridge I made a few shallow notches to stop the strings from sliding about, which would have affected the tuning. I used an android app called DA Tuner and tuned in the key of C from G3 up to the 16th string A5.\nMy original plan was for 15 strings but I divided my distance by 15 instead of 14 because I forgot the first string, the starting position is actually string 0 for these purposes and got a bonus string which was actually quite handy for playing Twinkle twinkle little star in the high register.\nAs anticipated the low notes are a little thunky and if I had thought breaking in the strings on a 4 string ukulele was tedious this really takes the biscuit.\nTo make finding my way around the strings more easy I used the traditional harp colour coding of red for C and blue (or black) for F with a pair of permanent markers.\nHere is the link to the demonstration video", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTW/XPQS/JN4VH4W4/FTWXPQSJN4VH4W4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9V/10N3/JN4VH4W7/F9V10N3JN4VH4W7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXM/BRFJ/JN4VH4W9/FXMBRFJJN4VH4W9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXD/EAOF/JN4VHAPM/FXDEAOFJN4VHAPM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKB/4MGZ/JN4VHAPN/FKB4MGZJN4VHAPN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSB/OD1O/JN4VGIUJ/FSBOD1OJN4VGIUJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 13: String It Up and Tune It"}], "channel": "Music"}, {"category": "Play", "description": "This is a fairly easy way to make covers for guitar or other instrument pickups.

The assembly with the second perforated 2x4 plate holds the black axle in place (third picture).\nThe stopper prevents the axle from sliding away, but leaves enough space to allow you to manually slide the crown gear away from the 8-tooth gear to stop automatic movement, or to calibrate the starting position before starting the sorter.\nAdd a leg\nNext we'll add a leg to the motor block, to support it at the correct height so the whole structure doesn't topple. Just a couple of regular 8x1 bricks and two plates are enough (picture four and five).\nAttach the external cables\nAttach both the external motor and the color sensor. It doesn't matter which cable goes where, since the programming blocks don't rely on the connection ID. Picture six and seven show the top view of the motor block and the cables coming from the main structure.\nReplace batteries\nIf your Boost block may need new batteries, this is a good time to replace them.\nMount the motor block\nWe can now mount the motor block.

We foresee spectators on one side, hence we use windows there, so they can see where the sorted candy lands.\nThe colored translucent pieces on top of that wall are there mainly for decoration, but also they are placed in front of the zone where Skittles of that color will be deposited. The same goes for the translucent blocks in the middle of the base plate.\nThe side walls are there to hold up the front wall and to avoid spillage. The middle wall is the divider between the green and yellow zone. It features a small 1x2 ridge to avoid Skittles hitting the divider head-on and bouncing back. That's probably an unlikely corner case, but we found the piece so we used it.\nThe two other dividers can't be placed in standard perpendicular Lego fashion. We worked around that by using 2x2 rotary plates on the base, at a distance of 6x4 of each other, and upright 12x4 plates with 90 degree angle attachments at the last position. Details of the 12x4 plates can be seen the second picture.\nThe third picture shows the blocks on the right side of the base plate. They are meant to align the legs at the same position every time, so that the pivot point of the slide is centered on the base plate. Pictures five and six provide detailed views.

Combining these elements in a program can be done via the \u201ccreate a project\u201d function of the Lego Boost app. If you've never created your own project, find instructions on the Lego website: https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/boost/articles/...\nUnderstand what the program needs to do\nThe main movement is the swiveling candy mover plate, driven by the A motor. Initialize it so the hole aligns with the feeder tube (slide away one of the crown gears to allow free movement, then slide the crown gear in place again). Initialize the slide in the central position.\nThe program can now, in an eternal loop,\nmove the plate \u201ca\u201d steps further using the A motor, \u201ca\u201d being just enough to position the candy below the color sensor. Adapt the \u201ca\u201d constant by experimenting.\nOne of the color sensor detection blocks will fire when the candy is in place, setting the \u201cd\u201d variable to the degrees of movement needed from the external motor to swing the slide to the correct zone. In the example, I associate red with -45, yellow with -15, green with 15, and black with 45. You might want to add a detection block for white, setting \u201cd\u201d to 0, to avoid movement when there is no candy.\nThe main loop waits for one second, then reads \u201cd\u201d and stores it in variable \u201cc\u201d. Storing the current value of \u201cd\u201d is needed because the color sensor will see bricks of other colors when plate moves. We need to remember the value associated with the candy color so we can move the slide back to the central position.\nThe external motor then activates, moving the slide \u201cc\u201d degrees.\nThe candy mover plate will now move the plate \u201cb\u201d steps further using the A motor, covering the distance between the color sensor and the drop position above the slide. Adapt the \u201cb\u201d constant by experimenting.\nThe program waits one second, which should be enough for the candy to drop in the correct zone.\nThe candy mover plate moves back \u201ca\u201d + \u201cb\u201d steps. We specify a negative speed to get the motor to turn in the other direction.\nThe slide turns back \u201cc\u201d degrees using the same trick: negative speed with a positive degree value.\nCreate the program\nI think it's fun to write your own program, but to help you, the included picture shows an example program. Values may need to be tweaked for your specific build.\nHave fun!\nIf you tried this project, we'd like to hear from you!

This may begin to cause resistance and intonation problems though.\nIf the mute is deep enough and there is not too much fabric, you may be able to use it in combination with a straight mute.\nWith some tweaking, I suspect a shallower mute could work just as well and take up less space.\nYou could take advantage of the puzzle-piece edges on the floor mats to make a mute that can be disassembled to save space.

You then attach your rusty item to the negative lead of a 12v battery charger and the positive lead to some scrap steel (not stainless! only use ferrous metals for this process!) The scrap steel collects rust and contaminants from the work piece (it acts as a sacrificial anode). The process is not noisy or caustic, so it can be a relatively safe way of removing rust. Just be very careful to not short out your battery and definitely use a GFCI receptacle to power your charger. Playing with this process was a big part of why I tackled this project. Liquid stripper would probably have been more efficient on the paint and there wasn't enough rust to really justify the electrolysis, but where's the fun in that?\nEverything's hooked up and cooking. The workpiece is attached to the negative battery terminal and submerged in the washing soda solution. The washing soda makes the water more conductive and aids in the process. The sacrificial anodes are attached to the positive terminal of the battery and spaced evenly around the work piece. As electricity flows, particles are removed from the work piece and are deposited on the anodes. This will not affect the base steel material, which makes it a gentle way to remove rust.\nI'd have preferred to hook the charger directly to the setup, but most modern chargers are smart chargers. Hooked directly, it detects that the \"battery\" is beyond dead and indicates a fault. Throwing an actual battery into the mix circumvents all that unnecessary safety nonsense.\n...but seriously, don't short batteries. Especially not near water. Be careful with your conductors.\nOverview of the items needed for electrolytic rust removal.\nBig plastic bin - (I put mine on a dolly to make moving it easier)\nSteel anodes (I used old window weights, they have a perfect eyelet at the top for making easy wire connections)\nWashing soda\nHeavy gauge wire and alligator clips - I used 6awg solid copper and some jumper cable ends that I had laying about the shop\nBattery charger/12v battery - If you have an old dumb charger, perfect.

This Instructable will walk you through the design of the box and how it fits together. It doesn't go into how I cut the box out or assembled it. To make it I used Inkscape to design each layer of the sides. Then I used a laser cutter to cut 4 different layers for each side out of 1/4 inch plywood. The layers were glued together when they didn't need to open, and screwed on if it needs to be removed to reset the combination. When assembled the Puzzle Box acts like a 9 stage Cryptex. I will walk through each side.", "title": "Wooden Programmable Puzzle Box", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Wooden-Programmable-Puzzle-Box/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The top of the Puzzle Box is locked with an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, and a number.

On a general rule of thumb, it's a good idea to replace your club grips once a year. If you find yourself playing and practicing multiple times a week however, you may need to regrip your clubs as often as 2-3 times a year. Many hackers out there (no judgments, I'm one too!) may have never regripped their clubs in years of occasional play, but you will absolutely see a difference after doing so - whether it's less impact on your hands, more consistent striking, a more comfortable grip, or more sticking and less slipping in your hands (nothing worse than having a club go flying out of your hands!).\nMany pro-shops and sporting goods stores will regrip your clubs for you, but often charge $3-5 per club plus the price of the grips themselves. With only a few supplies (many of them you may already have at home) and a set of new grips (these are available at many online stores for varying prices), you can regrip your entire set of clubs at home in 60-90 minutes and save yourself some cash and time.\nHere's what you'll need:\nGolf Clubs\nGrips\nMineral Spirits (or other solvent)\nPaint Tray or Bucket\nTape (preferably grip tape, but any double sided tape will do)\nShop/Paper Towels\nHooked Blade for Utility/Exacto Knife\nVise Clamp (or similar)\nRubber or Foam Shaft Protector (more on this later)\nEye-Protection\nLatex or Rubber Gloves (optional, depending on type of solvent used)", "title": "Regrip Golf Clubs", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Regrip-Golf-Clubs/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Depending on how old your current grips are and how much use they've seen, this process may be the most time consuming of all the steps in this tutorial. First, holding your club shaft about halfway up the length, you want to take your utility knife with the hooked blade and insert it just under the top edge of your existing grips. Holding your knife at a 45\u00b0 angle relative to the shaft (you'll be passing the blade along the shaft, rather than pushing directly into it) slide the blade along the length of the grips while moving the knife away from your hand holding the club (aka toward your body). You may need to flip the club over and repeat this process on the other side. Be particularly careful when doing this on graphite shafts and be sure your blade is only slicing through the rubber grip. Once you're all the way through butt of the grip, you should be able to pull this right off. Now the tedious part begins...\nYou'll want to remove as much of the old grip tape as possible from the shaft before applying the new tape. You may be able to peel some of this off easily by hand, but if the tape is quite old you may need to use some other tactics. One method is to take a shop towel, coat it in mineral spirits, and wrap it around the stubborn tape. Leave this in place for a few minutes while you remove grips from other clubs, and when you return to it much of the tape will be easily wiped off. If it still wont come off, you can take a dull blade (like a worn down chisel or flat-head screwdriver) and lightly scrape at the remaining tape while being very careful not to harm the shaft. You don't have to remove every slight piece of tape, but this won't (or shouldn't) be the last time you replace grips on these clubs so this annoying tape will build up over time. Once this has been completed on all of the clubs you'll be regripping, it's time to prep your space for the next step.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5K/O6U3/J20PA8W8/F5KO6U3J20PA8W8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ3/10FJ/J20PA8W9/FZ310FJJ20PA8W9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKH/7HE7/J20PA8WD/FKH7HE7J20PA8WD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQB/9WGP/J20PA8WF/FQB9WGPJ20PA8WF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ1/V9QZ/J20PA8WG/FJ1V9QZJ20PA8WG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRR/L326/J20PA8X1/FRRL326J20PA8X1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1U/EL5S/J20PA8X2/F1UEL5SJ20PA8X2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F13/WMM8/J20PA8X3/F13WMM8J20PA8X3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4A/IVL3/J20PA8XA/F4AIVL3J20PA8XA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRA/8I8L/J20PA8X6/FRA8I8LJ20PA8X6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEL/EP5F/J20PA8XI/FELEP5FJ20PA8XI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8P/RS7U/J20PA8XT/F8PRS7UJ20PA8XT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Remove Old Grips & Tape"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Before we get directly to installing the new grips, I want to discuss some of the options you have with the supplies you can use for this process. Feel free to gloss over this if you want to get right to the regripping.\nFirst, let's discuss your solvent. There are many products on the market specifically for regripping clubs, and they aren't necessarily priced any differently than solvents that you may find at a hardware store. The concept here is that after applying the tape to your club shafts, you coat them with a solvent that will lubricate them while you install the new grips. Once the solvent sets/evaporates, the tape will return to its sticky texture and your clubs will be playable. Thus, you can use many types of solvents for this process (paint thinner, alcohol, nail polish remover, lighter fluid, etc). I prefer to use mineral spirits for this process, as it is a little less abrasive and puts off less fumes than some of the products listed above. I found a kind of \"environmentally-friendly\" mineral spirits at my hardware store a few years ago that is odorless, non-flammable and can be handled without gloves. You can see the brand in the pictures above if you care to.\nNow, on to the grip tape. Once again, there is tape specifically designed for regripping golf clubs and it isn't any more expensive than any other double-sided tape you can find. This grip tape is manufactured and packaged in a way that allows for easy application. For the purpose of this guide, I'll be explaining the steps to apply this specific type of tape, but you can use double-sided masking tape or even clear double-sided scotch tape - you'll just need to put it on a little differently. I've used all three kinds and the only difference that I notice is in how the tape is applied to the club - they will all adhere the grips equally well to the clubs with no issues.\nLastly, there is the question of how you plan on holding your clubs in place while you apply the new grips. You'll need to use a bit of force when installing grips, so I recommend using something like a bench-top vise to secure your clubs. However you want to be careful not to squeeze the clubs right into a metal vise or you take the chance of damaging the shafts themselves. In the past, I had taken spare foam or rubber and used this as a buffer in between the club shaft and the vise, but came across a pre-made rubber vise clamp on Amazon that securely and safely holds your club shaft in place. You certainly don't need one of these to regrip your clubs but I enjoyed using it for the first time.\nOk, enough of that. Let's get to it!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJW/F0NJ/J20PA8W4/FJWF0NJJ20PA8W4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRI/PFE4/J20PAEAM/FRIPFE4J20PAEAM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F89/XLH3/J20PA8WA/F89XLH3J20PA8WA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWN/RKIS/J20PA8WB/FWNRKISJ20PA8WB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Discussion of Supplies"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Using whatever method you choose to hold your club in place, secure it tightly and grab a paint tray or other receptacle to hold your solvent in. Place this just below the end of your club shaft to store and catch the solvent that drips down during the application process. Take your grip tape and remove it from the tape sheet. Typical grip tape comes with a piece of paper on both sides of the tape which allow you to properly place the tape before removing the paper backing, exposing the adhesive side. You want to place the tape such that it runs in a straight parallel line along the shaft, extending 1/4\" to 1/2\" past the butt of the shaft. Place the bottom strip first, remove the paper backing and then place the top strip (reference the pictures above). Once both sides are in place, fold the excess tape on the end of the shaft around and slightly into the core of the shaft.\nGrab your fancy new grips and hold them at the bottom with one hand, being sure to press your index finger over the hole at the butt of the grip. Pour a generous amount of solvent directly into the grips (look to fill it about halfway). Cover the open end with your other index finger and shake the grip to fully coat the interior of the grip. After a few seconds of shaking, tilt the grip over the tape on the club shaft and slowly pour the solvent evenly across the tape (make sure to keep the hole on the bottom of the grip covered until the solvent is fully poured out!!). Once the grip is empty, use a finger to make sure that the tape is fully coated with solvent.\nYou'll want to install the grips fairly quickly here to prevent too much solvent from dripping off of the tape. You may need to slightly bend the open end of the grip to get it to fit over the butt end of your taped shaft. Once the grip is in place at the end of the shaft, try to use one uninterrupted motion to fully slide the grip on. The further up the shaft the grip goes, the more pressure you may need to exert to get it in place. Be sure that you're moving in a straight motion (not off axis relative to the shaft) and not pushing TOO hard. Use your best judgement and do what feels right. As your grips are likely made of rubber/leather, they will be able to stretch a little and you'll know that your grip is on fully when you can no longer push the grip forward, and the end furthest on the shaft will slide back toward you slightly after you let go of it.\nWith your grip fully in place on the shaft, you'll have about 60 seconds to ensure the proper alignment of the grip before the solvent starts to set. Take the club out of the vise and place the club head in between your shoes so that it's at the proper angle at which you'd look to strike a ball. Holding the head in place with your feet, use both hands to rotate the grips so that the grip logo is in perfect alignment along your shaft relative to the club head. This can be used as a handy reference (pun intended) about where to grip your clubs when on the course.\nFinally, take a clean shop towel and wipe off any residual solvent that you may have on your grip or shaft. Cover the bottom of the grip (where the hole is) with the towel and lightly bang it against the floor or your table top to coax any excess solvent out of the grip.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNC/PPHR/J20PA8Y8/FNCPPHRJ20PA8Y8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F82/MTJD/J20PA92P/F82MTJDJ20PA92P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIK/GG5M/J20PA8YN/FIKGG5MJ20PA8YN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYZ/N6PO/J20PA92X/FYZN6POJ20PA92X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXN/0YV1/J20PA8ZG/FXN0YV1J20PA8ZG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F27/12UQ/J20PA8ZH/F2712UQJ20PA8ZH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDZ/SXA4/J20PA8ZI/FDZSXA4J20PA8ZI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPE/V08Y/J20PA8ZM/FPEV08YJ20PA8ZM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYR/EHYT/J20PA908/FYREHYTJ20PA908.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIF/IZQR/J20PA90G/FIFIZQRJ20PA90G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH3/PJ16/J20PA90H/FH3PJ16J20PA90H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC0/XR1S/J20PA90J/FC0XR1SJ20PA90J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM1/N372/J20PA91C/FM1N372J20PA91C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOR/Q0MN/J20PA91D/FORQ0MNJ20PA91D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1V/2D1Z/J20PA91Q/F1V2D1ZJ20PA91Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPZ/3EFO/J20PA91U/FPZ3EFOJ20PA91U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5Y/DPV3/J20PA91X/F5YDPV3J20PA91X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPQ/FVY1/J20PA925/FPQFVY1J20PA925.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F65/ZBKT/J20PA92E/F65ZBKTJ20PA92E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3I/LS14/J20PA92M/F3ILS14J20PA92M.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Installing the Grips"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "That's it!

You need a piece twice as size as the eyestalk pattern. You also need one or more strips of felt in the color you want the \"stump\" to end in. You can use the same as the outside or something more \"fleshy\". If you go for the felt eyes you also need two pieces of white the size of the eye pattern as well as some black and possibly one other color. On the subject of other cloth to use, I have not tried it but I imagine using thin or fake leather will look interesting.\nthread - to sew the felt pieces together. Using the same color as the felt is strongly recommended, but you can get away with a close match or even black if all else fails. For the felt-eye-option white is best for obvious reasons.\nstuffing - cotton is the most common choice here, but I have started to use the cutoffs of a project, cut into small pieces, to stuff what needs stuffing. It works pretty well and makes you feel good about recycling.\npaper - to print the pattern on.\nacrylic ball (transparent) - one of the kinds that come as two halves that fit together. This will serve as eyeball (unless you go for the felt eye option). I designed the pattern to work with a diameter of 5 cm or 2\". You can scale it up or down if necessary, but you will have to figure out by how much - and if you shrink it be aware that inverting it will become that much more of an interesting experience.\nacrylic paint - to paint pupil and iris. I think black and white are mandatory for the eye, plus at least one color for the iris. I recommend using at least three to make it look good. I personally chose mostly metallic effect paint for that part. Since there is no need to paint the felt eye, this is only for the acrylic ball option.\npaper towels - for removing excess paint and fixing mistakes. Only needed when you want to go a little artsy on the plastic eye (and obsolete for the felt eye option)\nglue (paper) - for gluing two parts of the pattern together. I used a glue stick, but anything that bonds two pieces of paper for a few minutes should work.\nglue (acrylic to felt) - for gluing the plastic ball to the felt if you chose to do so. I would use ca-glue or contact cement, but check how well they work with your plastic balls first. Doing a test on the inside of it will save you some potential headache.\nTools\nscissors - to cut things.

It can come apart, break and shatter should someone decide to step on it.\nThe felt eye has a more muppet feel to it, and might not look as \"serious\" as a glaring plastic eye.

But that requires some care to get the result to look right. The main theme here is that you need to add details before adding the background, the inverse that you would expect when painting on a canvas, from back to front (see next step).\nIf your acrylic ball is like mine, it comes in two halves and has a piece of plastic on both that comes together for an eyelet to hang the ball from. Whether you use this eyelet for anything or not, it makes it pretty much mandatory to place the eye with the seam running perpendicular to the circumference of the cavity, if that makes sense. What I am saying is that this protrusion should be sitting at the very back. This arrangement, in turn, makes it necessary to paint the two halves so that the lines match up (pupil and iris). Not to worry, it is not that hard.\nIf your ball does not have that eyelet feature, you can choose to place them so that the seam runs along the outside, and paint the eye on one half only. In this case, you either need to glue both halves together or be really confident that they will hold even when you swing the eyestalk around.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FB7/Z204/JLQUU8VA/FB7Z204JLQUU8VA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: Option 1 - Acrylic Eye"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "The acrylic eye needs to be painted from details to background since what we paint will be seen from the outside looking in. What that means is that you need to put some thought into what you are doing. There is no painting over mistakes later.\nIf the seam between the two halves runs through your iris, you need to make sure to align both halves properly. For that purpose, I recommend drawing the circle of the iris on the outside of the acrylic using a felt-tipped marker for reference. The easiest way to do that is to place the ball on a round shape like a pipe or a shot glass and trace around it. Either use a board marker and be careful not to smudge the line during handling, or use a permanent one that you can later remove with rubbing alcohol.\nUsing painter's tape also works well to get semi-crisp lines, and I used this technique for the actual pupil. Since I wanted it cat-like in appearance, the tape worked really well. I doubt I would have used it for a round iris. The tape-method also allows you to line up both sides and make sure they come together as intended before you ass paint.\nSince this already sounds more complex than it actually is, I will go into how I built up the iris in the next step.

I watched far more talented artists paint dragon eyes in a similar fashion, and while I like to believe that I got the basics I might still be screwing up in a rather royal fashion here.\nNevertheless, here are the colors I used and what I used them for, in sequence:\nblack - for the pupil. I decided to make the eye catlike, giving it an elongated pupil that will hopefully cover up part of the seam. Going with a slit also allows you to use the spots where the outline of the iris intersects with the seam as connection points. A crisp line is important here, and hard to fix later. If you watch the video you will notice that my lines were not as crisp, though, due to the painter's tape used. I think I can still sell it as imperfections in the eye of an aberrant creature.\nThis is something I wanted to try but did not, so you can be the judge of whether it makes sense. With the dry brushing technique, I wanted to add a shadow along the inside of the iris. The idea behind this is to add paint to the brush, then stroke it over a paper towel to remove most of it. The (almost) dry brush will then leave behind very little paint, perfect for shading like this. On a side note, try to reuse the paint you left on the paper towel in some way.\nmetallic colors (copper and gold) - for details on the iris. Using toothpicks I added wavy and jagged lines connecting the pupil to the outline of the iris in a radial fashion. Think of it as muscles holding and shaping the pupil. I started with one layer of thin lines in one color, let that dry, then add the other. I repeated that process until the iris was pretty much completely filled. Take care not to scratch one first layer when applying the next.\nSomething you might want to try - and that I did not do - is to add dry-brushed black shading every few layers. I would expect that to give the iris some additional depth.\nbrown - for the iris background. I chose a matching color for the metals I used, and cover the metal details.\nred - to make veins on the eyeball. This was actually a request from my wife, where I would have left the eyeball white. As always, she had the right idea. I used toothpicks again, going for arcing, branching patterns, starting from the sides and approaching, but never quite reaching, the iris. Less is more here, I think, especially since depending on the size of your iris, you will not get to see much of those veins once the eyeball is in the cavity..\nwhite - for the general eyeball. This will cover up everything from the inside. The iris should already be covered, so you do not need to paint that part, especially since getting white spots where it might not have been painted over all too well is not desirable. You do not need to paint the white all the way to the back either since that part will not be seen anyway.\nWhat I actually did and you should not is confusing plain white with pearl effect paint. I tried to get it off but could not remove it completely.

There are several options for these, but to begin with, take the circle pattern and pin it to a double layer of white fabric (unless you do not want the eyeball to be white). Then cut it out along the outer line of the pattern.\nNow, we deviate from the eyestalk process. Take the two felt circles apart and do some soul-searching regarding the iris and pupil you want.

But that would have resulted in this opening, which you will have to sew by hand, to be visible on the side. Making it like the acrylic eye with the seam running through the pupil would, in turn, require sewing the iris to the finished eye, i.e. across the seam. So I opted for a third version - cut a hole in the back (not where the iris is), use it to invert, then stuff, and sew it shut.

The advantage is that the eye will remain slightly mobile and that you will be able to turn it, but if the thread gives, it will just flop around in its socket.\nAfter using this I am very much on the fence about this. If you use a rubber thread that will keep the tension, and stuff the stalk well enough, you should get a trophy with an eye that can turn. I doubt, though, that this \"effect\" is worth the hassle.

At once they formed themselves into groups and families, games and battles, friendships and enmities, making a small world. For a while he let this lively and yet orderly world go through its evolutions before my enraptured eyes in play and strife, making treaties and fighting battles, wooing, marrying and multiplying. It was indeed a crowded stage, a moving breathless drama.\nThen he passed his hand swiftly over the board and gently swept all the pieces into a heap; and, meditatively with an artist's skill, made up a new game of the same pieces with quite other groupings, relationships and entanglements. The second game had an affinity with the first, it was the same world built of the same material, but the key was different, the time changed, the motif was differently given out and the situations differently presented\" (Der Steppenwolf, Hermann Hesse).\n\nWhen I first saw a 3D chess board in Star Trek as a kid, I thought it was 'fascinating' ;)\nSorry, corny joke, but I was honestly attracted by it's graceful shape.\nSo, believe it or not, this is actually a Star Trek inspired project.\nMy other source of inspiration for this project (and this is probably more obvious) is nature.\nNot only did I try to use mainly natural materials and let the design be directed by the natural/organic shape of the wood that I selected, but I also wanted the gameplay to have a more natural flow to it as with traditional chess, which is pretty exact off course.\nSince not everyone who enjoys a game of chess is a very exact thinker, why not design a board that will be more suitable for non-exact thinkers.\nAlthough I was inspired by the Star Trek 3D chess board (not the first 3D chess board btw, google 'Kubikschach' and 'Raumschach' for instance) and initially aspired to create a 3D chess set myself, this chess tree should not be confused with 3D chess.\n3D chess is played in three dimensions; instead of just moving back and forth across the board it's also possible to move up and down through the boards.\nThis is not the case with my project, my plan of creating a 3D chess board quickly evolved into me wanting to redesign the traditional square chess board in a way that would evoke a more organic way of playing a game of chess.\nI did not want to stray to far from traditional chess, the boards of this chess tree have 64 fields, no unicorns or other extra pieces and the pieces move in the way that you're used to.\nHow should you interpret the term 'organic' in relation to chess you may want to ask... To start with, in 'organic chess' there are no predesignated starting positions.\nBlack and white both have two boards at their disposal to set up their game (black gets the two upper boards, white the two lower boards), The players can place their pieces at every field that they please within the boundaries of these two boards, the only restrictions being that the queens should be on their own color, the kings on the opposite color and a player should have one bishop standing on a black field and the other on a white field.\nBeing able to set up their own game provides the players with more space to prepare and work out their own strategy.\nFurthermore, the organic shape of the boards and the way in which the fields are spaced change the dynamics of the game in such a way that I think will excite the players to a more inituitive way of playing as opposed to calculative.\nI think this game is not very suitable for those that desire a very competitive game of chess, it's really more for a friendly match since there is a lot of room for the players own interpretation.\nTo illustrate this last point; although the order in which the players move their pieces from one board to the next is fixed, the field to which a piece transfers is open for discussion...\nThe 'rule' when you move a piece to the next board is that you step over to most logical field (that is, the nearest field of opposing color to the field the one you are currently standing on)... but of course our perception of which field this should be may differ since we all have a different point of view.\nI wanted the gameplay to reflect the dynamic interplay in nature where the one organism affects the other.\nNature may start of quite exact, but no organism can strictly stick to their own 'plan' because it shares it's habitat with other lifeforms which requires it to be flexible.\nIn nature everything flows together in a dynamic continuum where energy is being transferred from one phenomena to the next.\nOrganisms become as one in a dance where competition and interdependence are but two sides of the same coin.\nA game of chess can be seen as a micrososmos, a reflection of the way that the players shape their reality and how their stories intertwine, which creates a whole other dimension.\nI guess from a socio-psychological point of view you could say that even a chess game that doesn't involve moving pieces up and down through the boards could be considered 3D chess, since it consists of a combination of 'my dimension' and 'your dimension', the third dimension is where the two meet; 'our dimension' ;) lol\nHave fun!\nI have learned a lot during the process of creating this chess tree, some of the techniques that are illustrated in this Instructable I used for the first time, I had a lot of fun during this project and I hope that in sharing this I can pass on what I've learned to others, since I like to learn from others as well, off course I welcome suggestions :)",

the most important material used in this project I would like to spend some words on it.\nI selected this wood because of its shape but also minded what sort of wood it was and what state it was in.\nThere's hard wood and soft wood, hard wood usually comes from,broad leaved trees and soft wood from conifers, I was looking for hard wood because it's generally more durable, it's structure is more dense which gives it a different look then soft wood, so it's an aesthetical choice as well.\nThe state which the wood is in is important when selecting wood, I was looking for branches that had only recently parted from the tree, rotting wood is starting to disintegrate which is not a good feature and even wood that has been laying on the forest floor for a while but still seems to be in a relatively good state could be invested with insects or larvae, so better just leave it for them and find a decent piece.\nTo find a suitable branch I visited a specific place in the woods where I knew was a pile of branches that had broken of the trees there about two months earlier and which had been cut into smaller pieces and piled up aside the path.\nI selected a branch that kind of looked like what I had in mind, sawed it of and took it home.\nI'm not entirely sure what kind of wood it is but I think it's oak.\nThen I needed a wooden disk to use as a stand to mount the branch on, I found it when I visited a relative who has a very old plum tree growing on his land (you can see it on the picture above), he had just pruned it because some parts of the tree died, he had cut these thick branches into small pieces to put on the fire.\nI found a nice piece (which I like a lot because of it's whimsical form) and told my relative that I was going to saw it into four disks by hand, then he took out his chainsaw and cut it for me, which saved me a lot of work.\nThe wood for the boards came from a shelf from a cabinet in our house, we got this cabinet for free on the Dutch equivalent of Craigslist a few years ago, it was in a home for the elderly.\nI'm actually very pleased with it, it's a very large cabinet in a central place in the house and holds our tv, boardgames and wooden (toy) train set, only it came with to many shelves, we only use two and had two left over shelves which where kind of in the way and since it was perfect to cut the boards out off I used one for this project, this shelf is made of pine wood, a soft wood, which is convient for this purpose because it's very workable.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: About the Wood"}, {"step":

chisel into the wood and cut away flakes of it until the form that I desired emerged as you can see on the pictures.\nThen I used a wood rasp to smooth out the wood, the rasp I used had four sides with different grains and I used them all, starting with the course sides and ending with the finer ones, after that I used a file on the wood and after that, sandpaper with three different grit sizes (P80, P120 and P150).\nBy the way, this is the course of action I used on all the wood that I worked with in this project.\nAfter this the would felt nice and smooth.", "step_imgs":

Tree"}, {"step": 16, "steps_text": "I made the white pieces out of a birch branch and the black pieces out of a (presumably) oak branch, I liked the idea of using the natural color of the branch.\nI used one of the pieces from my marble chess set to determine the right size, after I cut the pieces of the branch I marked them on the bottom so I would not confuse them with other pieces.\nWith the use of a rotary multitool equipped with a wood sanding bit, I rounded of the top of the pieces and flattened out the bottom if necessary.\nThen I designed a crown for each piece, I based the design on the original chess pieces (or at least; the ones that we are all famillliar with), I did not want unrecognizable fantasy pieces... we used to own a Star Wars chess set, the pieces were these little figurines modeled after characters from the Star Wars movies, I used to get pretty annoyed while playing a game of chess using this set because I would fail to recognize which figure would portray a certain chess piece lol.\nI tried to make the shapes in these crowns look organic while still clinging on to the design of regular chess pieces.\nOnce I had designed the crowns, I cut them out of paper, traced them onto a sheet of copper and made a small adjustment as you can see because I thought that the straight line at the bottom of the crown was a bit boring and broke the organic design.\nThen I cut the crowns out of copper, washed off the marker lines and filed down sharp edges.\nNext I repeated the process of punching dents into the copper which you have seen twice before in the steps above.\nThen I straightened the crowns up a bit, using a regular hammer (start from the outer ends and work towards the middle) be careful because the copper will easily tear at this point.\nAfter this I formed the crowns around a piece of branch using my hands and a hammer, you can also do this on the chess piece itself.\nThen I applied heat patina to the crowns and clamped them around the pieces.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIS/451O/JL6UWKVD/FIS451OJL6UWKVD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKL/UX2B/JL6UWKVE/FKLUX2BJL6UWKVE.LARGE.jpg",

mind in the intro but to be honest, I think the players should decide on the rules together before they start playing the game... in a way I think this should be part of organic chess... to create something together, to go with the flow or against the grain, like I wrote in the intro; interdependence and competition are but two sides of the same coin... this game should be about mutuality.\nFor those who would like some guidelines,below this are the rules as I see them:\n- White starts at board 1 & 2 (the two lower boards)\n- Black starts at boards 3 & 4 (the two upper boards)\n- The players set up their pieces as they please within the boundaries of these two designated boards.\n*The bishops should start at fields of opposing colors, so one of a players bishops starts on a white field, the other on a black field.\n*The Queen starts at a field of her own color.\n*The King starts at a field of the opposing color.\n- Black starts playing clockwise across the boards and white counterclockwise.\n- When a piece reaches the end of a board this piece can transfer to the next board (only the next board not any of the other boards).\n- A piece can step over to the most logical field on the next board, this is, the nearest field of the opposite color from the field that the piece transfers from (this is starting to sound like a legal document lol), which field this is should be open for discussion since everyone has a different point of view.\n- Stepping over from one board to the next ends your turn, your piece stays on the field that it stepped over to and can't go any further until the other player has made his/her move.\n- When you've reached the end of your opponents first starting board you can step over to your own first starting board if you like and start a new cycle so to speak, you can't move back to the board you came from but have to start over this piece's journey (board four is white's first staring board, board 1 is blacks first starting board).\n- If you want to castle you should discuss the how and whens before you start to avoid misunderstandings, to me castling is just fine, could even be quite interesting with these free starting positions.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOB/Y0FG/JL6UWO9S/FOBY0FGJL6UWO9S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHR/3FX6/JL6UY4J8/FHR3FX6JL6UY4J8.LARGE.jpg",

A slight knock will knock over a few of them, making running the shooting gallery a tedious affair.\nThe version 1 targets were made for a couple of reasons, time and size. I always planned to make the targets out of plywood, but due to time limits (I thought about making the gallery only a week before it was required), I knew I wouldn't be able to source the appropriate disks in time. I also wasn't sure about the size of targets I would need, so wanted to make sure the gallery was built so I could best work out the size required.\nThe depth of the shooting gallery that I built was 144mm. With a 150mm disk, when it had been 'shot', the disk would still be approximately 75mm high when 'lying down'. This is due to the position on the shelf I would be required to place the disk. Therefore I have decided to go with 140mm disks. The 140mm plywood disks are not as easy to source as 150mm disks, so have a lead time of about 4 weeks.\nAttach a small hinge (18mm x 16mm) to the bottom of the disk. I used an epoxy glue\nThis block is positioned to stop the disk falling forwards, but to allow the disk to rest in a forward position, stopping the disk falling backwards too easily.\nAttached the hinge to the 'shelf' so it allows the target to stand up easily, but to also stop the target falling backwards too easily. I used 3 playing cards as spacers between the front block (not attached) and the target. This allows the centre of gravity to be slightly forward making it more stable.\nAttach a print out of the target to the front of the disk (glued with the stick glue)\nDrill a small hole in the centre of the block and glue a small magnet in it. This allows the magnet to 'grab' the hinge attached to the target, making it slightly more stable\nPaint the blocks\nUsing epoxy glue, glue the blocks to the 'shelf' in front of each target\nWhen the target is shot, it is forced backwards slightly and the centre of gravity is moved past the hinge meaning that the disk will fall backwards.\nTarget Righting Mechanism\nAfter the first trip out with the previous v1 targets, it was found that setting up the targets each time was rather tedious. Therefore I have added a target righting mechanism to make things much quicker.\nCut a number of metal wires (I had some 2.5 mm wire from a previous project). I used about 150 mm lengths\nCut a length of dowelling (8 mm diameter) to the width of the shooting gallery\nInsert the metal wires behind where each target would be, bending them so that they will raise the targets without scratching the targets\nUsing hot glue, glue the metal wires into place\nCut a handle and glue into place\nCut two supports one for each end and screw to the shooting gallery\nScrew the end blocks to the gallery, while holding the dowels", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWD/2TDG/JKWURW02/FWD2TDGJKWURW02.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTO/YKH4/JKWURW01/FTOYKH4JKWURW01.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3Y/9U88/JKWURW04/F3Y9U88JKWURW04.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCU/62YW/JKWURW07/FCU62YWJKWURW07.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7G/ZVUX/JKWURW0A/F7GZVUXJKWURW0A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7V/GIXW/JKWURVZZ/F7VGIXWJKWURVZZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD3/LDJ9/JKWURW0B/FD3LDJ9JKWURW0B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3Z/WYHO/JKWURW0D/F3ZWYHOJKWURW0D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJN/LCZJ/JKWURW0C/FJNLCZJJKWURW0C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9I/OY5R/JKWUS2ZH/F9IOY5RJKWUS2ZH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ1/8F5G/JKWUS30E/FJ18F5GJKWUS30E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F57/JKGF/JKWUS334/F57JKGFJKWUS334.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK9/CJ3S/JKWUS34Z/FK9CJ3SJKWUS34Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJH/Q8MT/JKWUS35W/FJHQ8MTJKWUS35W.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Targets - Version 2"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "The one recommendation I would make is go for the version 2 of the targets!

Being able to look at the apex of a corner while driving at high speeds allow you to move your car precisely through a corner without upsetting the car's balance and therefore reducing lap times. A fixed cockpit camera hinders your ability to do this, since the camera is always pointing forward, moving with the car, as opposed to looking on the sides and into the corners, like when driving naturally. This was the main reason I set out to resolve the issue of a lack of head tracking for consoles. However, throughout the development of the project, I noticed such a device could be appreciated by an even wider group of gamers.

This removes the need for external sensors, a dedicated computer for IR-tracking software and allows us to use a stock controller. In order to understand how our system will work we first need to understand how a stock controller works.\nMajority of gaming controllers use two Joysticks as inputs: one to move a character or vehicle and a second to control the point of view.\nThese joysticks consist of two potentiometers (commonly known as volume knobs) joined perpendicular to each other and work by measuring the resistance values when you move the joystick along the X-axis and Y-axis. These types of potentiometers are known as Analog Potentiometers and require you to physically interact with them in order produce an outcome. However, if we are able to bypass this physical interaction and can some how control the potentiometer with the use of an electronic circuit then we could effectively program a desired outcome without touching the joystick. Luckily, we could produce such an effect by using a digital potentiometer! Now we can control the movement of our character or the point of view with the use of just a couple lines of code.\nHowever, we can't stop there just yet if we want to build a head tracking system. We need to find a way to determine in which direction we are turning our heads and even the degrees of rotation. To do this we can use a gyroscopic sensor (AKA MPU) to track our head rotation and use those values to map onto our digital potentiometer to control the in game camera.\nIf you'd like to learn more about how to use an MPU 6050 and how they work, you can check out this video:", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYL/V669/JKN8TM5H/FYLV669JKN8TM5H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB8/4E30/JKSKDFBD/FB84E30JKSKDFBD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQK/CU31/JKSKDFXE/FQKCU31JKSKDFXE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Background Information"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "* These are all non-affiliated links, I only post these links as they are exactly what I used for this project.

I used maple planks to create the outside. I did this by using a table saw to cut the planks to spec via the prints I have attached to this step. The larger cut out on the top of each plank is where you will be placing the polycarbonate sheet that will hold the board as well as serving as a see through bottom for the lights. The other cut out is for the base to seal off the bottom. The bottom will also act as the area for a drawer and an area to mount your electronics plus a back up 9v battery.\nFrame\nAfter you have cut the 4 outside pieces wood, glue them together into a square. You should not need any type of bracket to hold it together. Between the wood glue and the epoxy resin the frame should be structurally sound. Be sure to cut out a place for the drawer and keep the piece you cut out as it will serv as the front end of the drawer. You can also go ahead and drill out a .5\" hole if you are adding a wall outlet power input. After the frame glue has dried paint the large inside lip black and stain the rest Ebony. The critical measurement is to make sure you have at least 21\" x 21\" on the interior of the top of the frame. This is where you will place your polycarbonate piece and the actual game board.\nBase Board\nFor the base board get some high quality planks that are .25\" thick and cut them to form a square that will cover the bottom of the board. After you cut them, dry fit them into the bottom of the frame to make sure it will fit. Apply wood glue and press them into the bottom of the frame to hold them while the wood glue drys. After it dries, stain it with Ebony stain. You can also go ahead and glue down drawer slides where your drawer will run. Be sure the base board is removable though as you will need to work on it before fixing it to the rest of the assembly. I used screws to hold my base board down so that it would be removable in case I ever needed to get inside of the game board after completion.\nDrawer\nThe drawer is made from .25\" high quality planks. Create a simple drawer by cutting a base section and 3 other sections to act as the walls. My drawer was a shallow wide one. The most important part here is to make sure to use the piece you cut out from the walls of the frame as the front. Also make sure you glue the drawer pieces .25\" above being flush with the bottom of the front face of the drawer. This is to allow for the .25\" base board that will sit in the bottom of the entire assembly. I did my glue process in 2 steps. The first were for the long side walls being clamped down to the bottom/base. The second were to clamp and glue the end caps.

I used a table saw to cut mine and other than a bad smell it worked fine. You can also cut it like glass using a scoring method.\nInserting into Frame\nAfter you have cut your square poly sheet simply use some type of adhesive or sealant to place it into the top of the frame. I used hot glue because sealant has a bad reputation for getting all over the poly sheet and making it look bad. Once you have glued and sealed it in, let it sit to dry. Please note, it is attached to the deeper cut outs on the frame walls. The shallower .25\" square cut out is for the base board at the bottom.\n---------------------------------------Game Board----------------------------------------\nCutting/Creating\nFor my game board I used a laser at work to etch and cut everything. You could place any type of game board into this you wanted. Resin will pour over nearly all materials without destroying them including papers.

The LED strips that are mounted to the bottom of the polycarbonate sheet, and the rest that are mounted onto the bottom plate that sits in the bottom of the wooden frame attached to the base board at the bottom.\n-----------------------------------------LED Strips------------------------------\nPlease note, this takes a long, long, long time to do. The way I did it was I measured out all the distances and did all my soldering in portions.\nPortion 1: All of the property colors\nportion 2: The Imperial Mission cards\nportion 3: The Stormcloak Mission cards\nportion 4: The Skyrim name logo\nportion 5, The Skyrim dragon logo\nPortion 1\nAll of these LEDs are soldered in series. Starting at the lowest value property and running up to the highest value. Considering they are in series you can simply measure how long each wire needs to be and how may LEDs you will need for each property spot. I used 5 LEDs anywhere there were 2 connected property spots and 2 LEDs for any single. So for example on the first row it was: Go Tile > 2 LEDs > Wire> 2 LEDS >Wire 2 LEDs > Wire > 5 LEDS > Jail Tile. I soldered all of my lights and wires to complete the entire board of properties and then went back and hot glued all of them so they were nice and tight. Please note that you will need to solder in one of the 3 pin connectors at the beginning of portion 1. This will server as a quick disconnect to the rest of the electronics on your board.\nPortion 2 & 3\nThe Imperial/Stormcloak mission card areas are fairly simple. However, it is important to notice that these are both wired in parallel. This means that you will have 3 wires coming off of portion 1 that are labeled GND, 5V, and DI. What you will need to do it is crimp or tie all of the LED strips togther for each wire coming off of portion 1. So for example, you would solder a wire to each of the 5V spots on the LED srips running across either of the mission card spots and then crimp all of them togther onto one end of a single but joint electrical crimp. Then you would run the 5v wire from portion 1 to the other end of the butt join and crimp it in. Therefore each of the 3 wires coming from portion 1 will connect to each of the wires going into the mission card strips.\nTo connect one mission card area to the next you simply recreate what you did to connect portion 1 to the first mission card area. At any of the parallel LED strips coming off of the first mission card area, run one of each wire: GND, 5V, and DI, to the next mission card area. Then run each single wire into each of the LED strips on that mission card area using a butt join in between.\nPortion 4\nThe Skyrim name logo is an area with 4 LED strips all running in parallel across the name. This will be install in a very similar way to the mission card areas. solder a short lead wire onto each of the 4 strips at the beginning of the LED strip for each input, GND, 5V, and DI. Then crimp all 4 of each wire type together to make them a single input and run your single wire from the previous mission area to be crimped in as well. At the end of one of the LED strips across the Skyrim name logo you will need to solder in 3 wires as an output to go onto the Skyrim dragon emblem logo.\nPortion 5\nThe Skyrim dragon logo is a long run of series LED lights that sweep back and forth down the length of the Dragon Emblem. Solder all your LEDs together with wires make \"U\" bends between each row and hot glue down.\n-------------------------------------Bottom/Baseboard electronics----------------------------------\nArduino Uno and Buck Converters\nFor the Uno and Buck converters you will want to hot glue or fasten them to the base board underneath the large unused area of the game board. Measure out where the best spot to glue them down is. Make sure to glue them down together so that it will be a short distance between them to run power.\nOn/Off Switches\nI have 2 On/Off Switches, one for battery power and one for wall power. It is important to never turn both of these on at the same time. For your switches simply drill two .75\" holes beside your buck converter and slide them in. You should have 2 prongs for electrical flow on each switch and a third one that is a different color to keep the LED on the button turned on even when power is not supplied. Tie two of the electrical prongs together by crimping some female terminal ends together and run them both to the input of the buck converter. That should leave one electrical prong on each button open to run to your power supplies, both the battery or the wall outlet.\n9v Battery\nI placed my 9v battery holder right inside the drawer entry for each access. I 3d printed my 9v battery holder however you could easily buy a mount on amazon. From there simply run your positive and ground wire from your battery holder to the buck converter/button area. Run the GND wire into the GND side of the buck converter and the positive side into one of the prongs still open on one of your buttons. Be sure to glue down the power wires at reasonable intervals to keep the wire from moving around.\nWall Outlet\nFor the wall based power supply you will need to take your power supply and splice it open to reveal a red and black wired. From here use two butt join electrical crimps to connect it to the red and back wire on the 3 pin connector. Splice both the wall power supply into one side of the butt join and the 3 pin connector into the other side. From here wrap with electrical tape for a secure connection. Now you should have a wire with the wall power supply on one end and one of the 3 pin connectors on the other. Make sure to use the correct 3 pin connector, (male vs female).\nWall Outlet Input\nThe wall outlet input is fairly simple. Get another 3 pin connector, the opposite of the one you used for the wall outlet, and use butt joint connectors to attach a red and black wire. From here you will need to attach it to the base board but leave enough slack in the wire so that you can pull it through the hole drilled into the frame for the wall power supply. Take a look at my pictures of this to get an idea of how much slack to leave the wires.\nLED Strips Input\nTo create the LED output connector you will need to run one 5v wire from the buck converter, 1 GND wire from either the buck converter or the Arduino Uno, and one digital pin wire from the arduino uno to a 3 pin connector that is the opposite you used for the bottom side of the LED board. Hot glue your wires down and run the 3 pin connector to the same area you placed the LED connector so that they can be locked togther when you do your final closing of the box.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKJ/91NG/JKIK9AUO/FKJ91NGJKIK9AUO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF6/7LXW/JKIK9AX6/FF67LXWJKIK9AX6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUY/VMKW/JKIK9AZX/FUYVMKWJKIK9AZX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW9/HJ1E/JKIK9B4P/FW9HJ1EJKIK9B4P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX8/JHKS/JKIK9BBQ/FX8JHKSJKIK9BBQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPR/2B2T/JKIK9D8K/FPR2B2TJKIK9D8K.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Electronics Mounting/wiring"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "I am a big arduino fan and wanted to incorporate it into this project.

I found that thegnome54 had described another very nice version of a color SuDoku. But I neither have their craftsman skills nor the required equipment.\nSo I was wondering if it might be possible to build one myself, using some abundantly available, colorful parts, namely LEGO bricks. We have boxes full of Legos that have been accumulating over decades, so I thought it shouldn't be a problem to find enough of the right bricks. Nice starting hypothesis, but it failed. More on this later.\nI have experimenting with a number of layouts, and have not worked out all details for every LEGO color SuDoku version presented here. I am still improving the concept and will report the results here.\nBut I hope you like the idea and will get some inspiration to build your own versions. Or just pick the version that fits best for you.\nOn the pictures in this and the following steps you will find different versions of the \"LEGO color SuDoku\". The first two versions showed above are using [32x32] plates, are the recent versions. Especially the version with double [2x2] bricks and the large flat cap (image 1) is looking cool. But the version without large caps (images 2 & 3) is more colorful, better to play and my current favorite. The version on the last picture was build at first and uses a 48x48 knob base plate.\nOne of the cool features of the recent version is that one can label the [2x2] bricks with small tags. This allows to experiment with different decision options if you get stuck, trace the stones set after one of the ways were taken and remove them if it has been the wrong one. You can't do this that simple in paper SuDokus.\nVersion July 6, 2018\nStill work in progress. If you are interested, please come back from time to time", "title": "LEGO Color SuDoku", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/LEGO-Color-SuDoku/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I suppose that if you are interested in this Instructable, you may have an idea what SuDoku is about. But let's define it nevertheless.\nThe classical SuDoku is a 3x3 array of nine 3x3 arrays. The smaller arrays are to be filled with nine different objects. In addition, all nine different objects shall to be found once in every of the nine columns and any of the nine rows.\nAs a starting point, several of the objects are placed at predefined positions, and you then have to fill the empty spaces such that the final result fulfills the rules described above.\nUsually we are using the numbers one to nine (1, 2, 3, ..., 9) as the \"objects\" to fill the arrays, as these are symbols known to most of us, and fit nice into a 3x3 array. But one could use any other nine-member set of symbols, as letters, signs, emojis, ...\nColors, on the other side are represented in our brains in areas other as abstract symbols as numbers or letters, and we are pretty good in the interpretation of visual information.\nSo using nine different colors seems not only be a pretty looking solution, but might also allow even small children, chimps and most aliens to play SuDoku (the guys from Proxima Centauri wont read this anyway, and they may build it with sound blocks). Using color blocks will also allow you to turn the SuDoku playfield around and thereby e.g. simplify the identification of doubled color bricks.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVB/EPHR/JIYU6PAE/FVBEPHRJIYU6PAE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1N/E7MA/JJ8UBD0W/F1NE7MAJJ8UBD0W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSC/ZNY2/JJ8UBD0Y/FSCZNY2JJ8UBD0Y.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: SuDoku - a Bit of Theory"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I am focussing on the most improved versions in this step, and moved all about early or alternative versions into a step at the end of the instructable.\n------------------\nGeneral Layout ([32x32] uncapped version)\nThe numbers of a usual SuDoku are represented here by [2x2] bricks (single or stack of two) of nine different colors. They are placed on a playing field on a [32x32] knob LEGO base plate. The nine [3x3] arrays are separated by each others by double rows, whereas the bricks within the arrays are separated by single rows. The outer border is defined by double rows as well.\nTo make it esier to transfer numerical Su Doku examples into the color format, I added a flat brick as \"cap\" to [2x2] bricks of all nine colors and wrote the numbers on them. These \"Rosetta bricks\" now correlate each color to a specific number.\nThe stones defined by the SuDoku template are marked by a flat [1x2] brick as \"fixed\".\nSometimes you have to decide to follow either one ore another logical option to see with will be helpful or not or lead to contradictions after some steps. I here used (round) single knobs of a defined color to track setting of bricks resulting from such a decision. The decision points are labeled with an additional color. So if the decision turn out to be wrong, you can selectively remove the stones up to the decision point. (see Play it-step).\n-------------\nGetting the bricks\nGetting the bricks was a bit challenging. For the first version I found many of the required pieces and the plate in our Lego collection boxes. But it turned out to be really hard to find nine [2x2] blocks of nine different colors. So I started by using other bricks and colors, and combine some of the rare colors, for the first prototype (see the last image above). You have to use what you have got. I used an old [48x48] knob plate as a base.\nLuckily we have a LEGO Store at Berlin, which has a Pick-a-Brick wall. There you can get larger numbers of the offered bricks for just 10\u20ac for a small, 18\u20ac for a larger bucket full of bricks. But you never know what will be available, in terms of colors and forms, at a given visit.\nThere I got the flat gray [2x2] and [1x2] blocks and the required amounts of [2x2] blocks of \"rare\" colors as brown, beige, blue or green, raspberry and pink to complement the colors I already had.\nWith a little luck and some optimization (stack the [2x2]s) all the required bricks will fit into one of the large pick-a-brick buckets.\nThe \"classic\" [32x32] base plates should be available at any good toy shop.\nThere are similar Lego shops in several other major cities. You find a list of Lego shops here.\nThere are a number of online portals where you can buy individual bricks. In case have a look there.\n------------------------\nMaterial list\nFor a [32x32] plate version:\nA [32x32] knob blue \"classic\" building plate,\n7.99 Euro, LEGO shop Berlin\nFrom the Pick-a-Brick wall at the Lego Shop, and with a little help from the guys from the shop (thanks !):\nten or twenty [2x2] bricks each in nine different colors\nat least 76 [2x2] light gray flat low profile bricks\nabout 160 [1x2] dark gray flat low profile bricks\nseveral round single knob bricks in red, rose, white and dark yellow\nAt least for the single brick version, they should fit all into one large LEGO Pick-A-Brick bucket,\n17.99 Euro, LEGO shop Berlin\nFor the large cap version:\nas above, but at least 157 [2x2] light gray flat low profile bricks.\n----------------------------\nBuilding it\nPlace the flat [2x2] and [1x2] bricks on the [32x32] base plate as indicated in the images above to build the playing field.\nIn case build stacks of two of the [2x2] bricks of each color.\nPlace a large flat brick on top of a brick of each color, sort them in some \"logical\" order (e.g. rainbow) and write numbers \"1\" to \"9.\" on them.

A few liberties have been taken as described below. If you are only able to rigidly follow instructions, then this is not for you; some creativity will be required because It does not cover the complete construction of the grandfather clock in the first video; rather, it covers the essential elements (the escapement, the pendulum, the gear trains, the assembly for the hands, etc) which enables that kind of clock to be built - the first video shows an implementation of the clock elements which are covered in this Instructable. The dial and case are left to the builder according to their taste. The second video shows a working cut-down version of the clock (with a shorter pendulum so that it ticks faster in the video) which this Instructable does cover. The clock in the first video ticks for just over 24 hours on a single wind. It does not have a striking mechanism. It uses two weights, one on each side of the clock. This Instructable covers only part of one side, the other being a mirror image of it, and so there is only one weight in it.\nThe Inspiration\nThe serendipitous discovery of a K'Nex yellow gear with 84 teeth was the inspiration for this clock. There are three types of K'Nex gear: the small blue captive gear has 14 teeth; the red gear has 34 teeth, and the large yellow gear normally has 82 teeth. These cannot be directly used to create the 12 to 1 ratio that a clock's minute and hour hands need, but the yellow gear with 84 teeth changed all that - a 6 to 1 ratio was now available, which was half way there! The K'Nex user Shadowman39 pointed out that it might have come from a solar set. It also appears in one of the educational sets.\nThe Goal\nThe goal was to create a K'Nex-based clock which would tick for 24 hours on a single wind. This does not mean that the clock is wound just once each day, because in practice the time of winding can vary by a few hours - that is why an old-fashioned alarm clock was referred to as a '30-hour clock'. The clock has a main wind in the morning, and a 'top-up' in the evening. The goal of 24 hours was achieved by:\n* Having an escape wheel with 16 teeth instead of the K'Nex-implied eight.\n* Using two weights (3kg each) instead of one so that, effectively, one heavy weight could be used which otherwise would have bent K'Nex rods. This enables a higher gear ratio than would otherwise have been possible.\n* Making the clock as high as was reasonably sensible, with the weights starting at the very top of the clock and moving to the very bottom.\n* Using a pulley system so that for every inch of line wound round the spool, the weight moves only a quarter of an inch.\n* Making sure that the clock had a slow tick so that a single wind would last as long as possible.\nTerminology\nThe terms 'rod', 'shaft', 'axle' and 'arbor' have been used interchangeably.\nThe term 'plate' refers to the front or back side (normally made of brass) of the movement which has the pivot holes in it.\nA traditional grandfather clock has the weights supported by gut - it is very hard-wearing, lasting up to 60 years. The clock in the videos uses braided nylon, but the current version of the clock uses very thin and very strong fishing line. It is therefore referred to as 'line' in this Instructable.\nThe Use of K'Nex\nK'Nex is a great construction toy but the pieces are made of a fairly soft plastic. In order to build a clock which incorporates heavy weights, some non-K'Nex pieces have been used. A few screws have been used to clamp some pieces together to avoid destructive torsion in rods, and some lead weights have been used (a heavy one to drive the clock, and two light ones to balance the hands). Some pieces (not many) have been cut, and so K'Nex purists may wish to abandon this Instructable now! There is some electrical wiring in the clock in the first video, as well as a couple of micro switches and an electric bell. It is fair to say, though, that over 99.9% of the components of the clock are K'Nex.\nThe Design\nA pendulum clock works by using a swinging pendulum to allow an escape wheel to rotate at a constant rate (the teeth of the wheel 'escape' the pallets). The escape wheel is at the end of a train of gears; at the other end is either a barrel which contains a mainspring, or a spool which is turned by a heavy weight. Whichever method is used, the escape wheel is given a rotational force which gives the pallets, and therefore the pendulum, an impulse each time it swings to the left or to the right. Use Google for more details.\nThe intention was to make a clock which ticked once a second, just like a real grandfather clock. The escape wheel has 16 teeth and so it needed to turn once every 32 seconds, i.e. 112\u00bd times each hour. A red gear in mesh with a blue gear gives a ratio of 34/14, and so three of these in series will give a ratio of 343 / 143 = 14.32... This is about 1/8th of the target, and so an approximate one-second tick can be achieved with three lots of red/blue gears and a pseudo 8-1 gearing (which can be done by using 8-way connectors). The precise duration of the tick would therefore be 3600 / (343 / 143 x 8 x 32) = 0.98177 secs. This is pretty close to one second and is the best that can be achieved. In practice it sounds like a one-second tick.\nProblems Encountered\nThe clock was built a year ago and various problems have arisen, some of them causing causing it to stop. It is problems like these - the finding and fixing of glitches - which make such a project so interesting.\n* Once or twice, embarrassingly, the clock has stopped apparently for no reason only to find that it had not been wound! It is very easy to start looking for an obscure fault instead of starting with the obvious.\n* During the early stages of the build the clock would stop because one of the weights had got caught on something in its path (another embarrassingly obvious cause that should have been spotted earlier).\n* Attempting to turn a K'Nex gear on one end of a rod when there is a gear on the other end which drives further gears creates torsion in the rod. Over time the rod gradually becomes weaker, ultimately resulting in shredding. This is why, three months after the initial construction, two of the yellow gears had long screws passing through them (see Step 5 - The Gear Train).\n* When the clock is wound, the ratchets are moving for 25 minutes. Over the course of a few months, some movement of the pieces on the rod which has the ratchet on it has taken place. In particular, the tan clip which slots into the inner part of the ratchet has tightened against it. This has not only made the winding noisy but has also made the yellow gear next to the ratchet become wobbly and not mesh with the blue gear very well. Because there is very little power reaching the escape wheel, the slightest resistance can cause the clock to stop. The ratchets need to be checked every few months and loosened if necessary. The whole gear train - from the winding spool to the escape wheel - must be very free-running.\n* The word 'wind' has two connotations with this clock. it is necessary, of course, to wind the clock twice a day, but once or twice the clock has stopped because of wind, as in strong breeze! The clock was standing next to an open window and the wind blew against the pendulum, causing the clock to stop. It took a couple of weeks to find the cause because it was an external influence.\n* All moving parts need to be liberally oiled in order to minimise resistance.\n* The original escape wheel (as seen in the first video) was sloppier than the current one. This caused the teeth of the escape wheel to bounce briefly against the pallets, thus sapping some of the energy. The escape wheel in this Instructable is much more rigid, but because it is heavier the clock's weights had to be made slightly heavier (so maybe it wasn't worth changing the escape wheel after all - but the tick does sound healthier).\n* When making the case it was difficult (here in the UK) to find enough red triangular panels. There seems to be a dearth of square panels of any colour too! Sites such as eBay are useful, and the K'Nex User Group is a very useful source, but even they have very few of the required panels. From 2010 to 2015, car boot sales were a very good source, but strangely K'Nex is hardly seen at them now.\nThe Steps in this Instructable\nStep 1: The Escape Wheel\nStep 2: The Pallets\nStep 3: The Crutch\nStep 4: Combining the Escape Wheel, Pallets and Crutch\nStep 5: The Gear Train\nStep 6: The Winding Spool\nStep 7: The Pulleys and the Weights\nStep 8: The Pendulum\nStep 9: The Transmission to the Hands\nStep 10: The Hands Assembly\nStep 11: Winding the Clock\nStep 12: Regulating the Clock\nStep 13: Maintaining the Clock", "title": "K'Nex Grandfather Clock", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/KNex-Grandfather-Clock-1/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The escape wheel needs to be a solid block; any flexing in the teeth will sap energy from the escapement.\nWhen attaching the eight rotational connectors in the 8th and 9th pictures, make sure that they click into position - it is very easy for one to look in place when it isn't.\nIn the 10th picture, rotational connectors have been added around the outside of the escape wheel.

One end of the line is fixed at the top of the clock on its side. The line then goes down to the first pulley on the weight, up to the fixed pulley, down again to the second pulley on the weight, and up to the winding spool via another fixed pulley at the top of the clock. The result is that for every inch the weight falls, four inches of line are unwound from the spool. This mean that when the weight falls the full height of 80 inches, the line unwinds 320 inches. This, combined with the fact that the escape wheel has 16 teeth rather than the obvious 8, is how the clock can tick for so long on a single wind. Another factor is that the line (which is very strong fishing line) is very thin so that there is very little overlapping on the spool (this would increase its effective circumference and thus use more line for each revolution).\nIn the construction in this Instructable there is just one weight with a single pulley on top of it (see the last image).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2C/5S5E/JIAJUKC3/F2C5S5EJIAJUKC3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCF/OO4Y/JIDGKE0J/FCFOO4YJIDGKE0J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZN/QHGB/JIDGKE0K/FZNQHGBJIDGKE0K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTT/DK69/JIDGKE0L/FTTDK69JIDGKE0L.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: The Pulleys and the Weights"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "One of the advantages of a grandfather clock is its excellent timekeeping, mainly due to the long, slow-swinging pendulum.\nFor a one-second beat the centre of gravity of the pendulum must be around 39 inches from its top.\nThe first picture shows the basic design of the one for this clock.

It consists of a small weight (c200g) on the end of a K'Nex chain which is manually raised before the winding is started.

Due to the difficulty in obtaining extremely wide, short cylinders, a 5-gallon bucket is used as the drum, limiting the length of the song that can played--depending on the speed at which the drum is spun, a melody repeats about once every 2 seconds.\nTo build this project, you will need a chop saw and general drilling equipment.

You can do this by using a 2.375in hole saw, a 2.5in hole saw (if a 2.375in hole saw in unavailable), or a large drill bit and multiple passes. The external diameter of a 40 schedule 2in PVC pipe is 2.375in, so aim for this diameter. The 1in holes are for rubber bands or springs you will attach later.\nOnce you have prepared your first piece of plywood, create a duplicate different only in that instead of 1in holes, there is something in the same spot to attach rubber bands or springs to. We used eye-hooks. Use a piece of plywood and two boards with roughly square ends to separate the two plywood sheets at a distance of about 1in shorter than your shortest PVC so that they are parallel to each other. You may need to use small blocks in the joints in the back if your plywood is too thin to accept a screw (this is what we did).\nThe plywood that you use on the back must be long enough to support the flaps so that they can evenly strike the bottoms of the PVC. Create these flaps with a width of 2.25in and a length of 0.5in longer than the short side of your plywood with holes (the flaps should be able to stick past the edge of this plywood). Glue circles or squares with a width of 2.25in made of some rubbery material such as a flip flop 0.5in from the edge of each flap, and if possible, create a recess so that these pads can lie flush with the flaps (we used a table saw with the blade set low, but a router could work too). Use small hinges to attach the flaps to the plywood back about 0.5in below the lower plywood board (the one with 10 total holes) so that the flaps can move freely to strike the PVC when you install it.

The grid should be composed of 24 evenly spaced, vertical lines around the bucket and 5 rings up the length of the bucket. These rings should be spaced so that when the bucket is held horizontal next to the PVC frame, the rings line up with the centers of each hole. After you have drawn the grid, you will need to mark which intersections will have a dowel. To use the song we used, decide which vertical line will be the beginning and mark its intersection with the ring you drew closest to the wider end of the bucket. Then mark the remainder of the intersections by following the music we provided as an attachment. Each vertical line on your bucket corresponds to an 8th note and each ring corresponds with the 5 notes in the music (if you are not familiar with written music, read this page: https://www.musicnotes.com/blog/2014/04/11/how-to... You can also write your own song.\nAfter drilling guide holes in each intersection you marked, drill holes large enough to accommodate the diameter of your dowels. If you don't have a drill bit large enough, you can enlarge the holes with a file (it also helps to have a tight fit for when you pour cement into the bucket). Cut your dowels into 2in segments (you should have as many segments as you have holes drilled) and place the segments into each hole so that their ends are all the same distance from the axle (do not insert them the same distance into the side of the bucket; because the bucket is not perfectly cylindrical, this will result in some pegs being too far from the flaps they are meant to hit).\nWhen the axle and dowels have been placed, place the assembly vertically on blocks with a height of about 2in so that the axle can extend 2in below the bottom of the bucket. Then mix and pour a bit of cement into the bottom of the bucket around the axle and lowest dowels. Place the lid around the axle and snap it to the top of the bucket and allow the cement to dry until it is somewhat firm but still wet (this will help ensure that the axle is straight). Then place the hollow container around the axle and push it down to the drying cement and pour the remainder of the cement to fill the bucket up to the lid before securing the lid with glue to the top of the bucket. Before the cement dries, make sure all the dowels are perpendicular to and equidistant from axle (you will have some time to adjust them before the cement is hard). Allow the cement to dry for at least the recommended time before attempting to lift the bucket, and do not remove the bucket from the blocks that support it. Be sure to clean any cement that may have escaped from the holes.\nWhen the cement has dried, drill guide holes in the center of each dowel and screw in either screws or eye-hooks. They should not be screwed in all the way, and by adjusting their depth you can calibrate the length of each protrusion.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1D/60G8/JI0JHWR8/F1D60G8JI0JHWR8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTN/092V/JI0JHV1P/FTN092VJI0JHV1P.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Build the Drum"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Obtain a plywood board with a minimum length and width of 20in and a minimum thickness of 0.5in, about 48in of 2 by 4, two bearing sets designed to bear radial load (force perpendicular to the axis of rotation), and plenty of screws.

Make sure that the holes are in the same place on each board. After glueing the bearings into the holes (and ensuring that no glue comes in contact with any moving part of the bearing!), screw the 2 by 4s into the large plywood board so that they are parallel, span a width slightly larger than the height of the bucket, and are in line with the edge of the board. Remove one of the 2 by 4s, place the axle of the drum into both bearings, and screw the 2 by 4 that you removed back in place.

If your hole saw was too large, wrap the PVC in tape where it will meet the frame to fill the space. Before allowing the glue to dry, make sure that the PVCs are aligned so that the flaps strike the bottoms completely squarely and flatly.\nAfter the glue dries, use the remainder of the 2 by 4s from the previous step to suspend the PVC frame and PVCs so that they are perpendicular to the base of the drum frame and so that the protrusions (dowels with screws) from the bucket will barely catch the flaps as the drum spins. If any protrusion does not catch or is too long, turn the screw to adjust the length of the protrusion. How you suspend the frame depends on the wood available to you and the specifics of your frames, but anything will work as long as the protrusions catch and everything is stable. We screwed segments of 2 by 4 to the solid wood of the PVC frame and screwed the ends of the 2 by 4s to the base of the drum frame.\nAt this point, you should be able to spin the bucket towards the PVCs so that the melody is produced. You can stop here, or you can add a handle with which to spin the drum. We did this by screwing a paint stick into the axle, but there are many ways you could add a handle.

There should be 20\" inches between the sides up front, and the axle should be centered.\nAttach the gussets to the rear of the axle and flush up against the sides as shown. glue on the back and side of each gusset where it meets the axle and side wouldn't be a bad idea. Two screws attach it to the axle, and two more on each side to the side pieces, as shown.

You could certainly get creative with zip ties and gaff tape here, but I suggest sewing if you can.\nI recommend using a heavier denim or upholstery thread, but with an all-purpose needle in your machine.\nCut a 48\" diameter circle out of the ripstop. Pin or clip and fold the outer inch and a half back over itself to make a sleeve, where we'll thread the cam strap through. Sew the sleeve up.

Sew this to the side the outer edge isn't folded over and sewn on so your seam remains hidden. I recommend sewing the 1\" square of nylon webbing on the other side of your stitch to prevent tear out. This gives your thread something much more substantial to hold onto than just the ripstop nylon. I did experience minor tearing before I did this. Stitch a square on where it mounts and few zig zags. You really can't have too much stitching on this part, so have at it. See the video for some examples.\nDo the same on the opposing side with the 3\" piece and the 2 one inch squares. This is where our bungee will thread through, so you want it 90 degrees perpendicular to the handle.\nThread the cam strap through - a wire coathanger or similar would be helpful here.\nTie your bungee to one handle of the garbage can. If you have the same one as me, there's some conveniently placed holes in the handles that you can thread it through.\nThread the bungee through the smaller nylon webbing loop you made in the baffle. Leave the other end untied for now.\npush the whole baffle through the ring you cut in the end of the cannon.

The second is me with it connected to a loop pedal just messing about....this is also out of tune but it at least shows you the tone I can get from the violin.\nThanks for reading", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FH4/BIGG/JHIA4Y4F/FH4BIGGJHIA4Y4F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG9/RLK4/JHIA4Y8L/FG9RLK4JHIA4Y8L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFC/G6TD/JHIA4YA3/FFCG6TDJHIA4YA3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYY/W506/JHIA4YBG/FYYW506JHIA4YBG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAU/Y873/JHKTTDAF/FAUY873JHKTTDAF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEP/YVUE/JHKTTKEM/FEPYVUEJHKTTKEM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 13: Finished"}], "channel": "Music"}, {"category": "Play", "description": "Learn how to make this working pinball machine completely from Lego.", "title": "Working Mini Lego Pinball Machine", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Working-Mini-Lego-Pinball-Machine/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Watch the Video"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Start with a 4 x 10 plate and make 2 legs that stick out 2 studs.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFD/1JYA/JH9LJS6V/FFD1JYAJH9LJS6V.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2:"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Start building upwards, use some headlight bricks so we can add some obstacles later.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYU/BB5A/JH9LJS8C/FYUBB5AJH9LJS8C.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3:"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Smooth off the edges with some tiles and slopes.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9M/E48J/JHATJT4R/F9ME48JJHATJT4R.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4:"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Keep building up and then you'll want leave a flat space on top.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FE0/8EW3/JHATJZFY/FE08EW3JHATJZFY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5:"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Next we'll need to build this assembly and then hook 2 small rubber bands on the back.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOD/3932/JHATJZYA/FOD3932JHATJZYA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6:"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Now place that assembly upside down on the top of our main assembly.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FV1/EMT2/JHATJZ9T/FV1EMT2JHATJZ9T.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7:"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Next we'll need to clamp it down with a plate.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FEQ/WOO7/JHATJZX6/FEQWOO7JHATJZX6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8:"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Now attach some pieces with some sort of hook on them and hook the rubber bands on.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYX/YGJ2/JHATJZ9S/FYXYGJ2JHATJZ9S.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9:"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "Keep building up the sides.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBC/2S5A/JHATLE5F/FBC2S5AJHATLE5F.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10:"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "Use a 1 x 4 plate and a gear plate stacked together to make the flipper buttons.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJN/P5CV/JH9LJTC8/FJNP5CVJH9LJTC8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 11:"}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "Place the flipper buttons face down on the gears in the gap on top, leaving 2 teeth sticking out.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FV4/6X4E/JHATLEKH/FV46X4EJHATLEKH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 12:"}, {"step": 13, "steps_text": "Place a 1 x 10 plate in the gap above the buttons then keep building up, leaving a spot where the ball can exit.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAB/W2SC/JHATYHCN/FABW2SCJHATYHCN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9Z/SX0J/JHATIKCW/F9ZSX0JJHATIKCW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 13:"}, {"step": 14, "steps_text": "Add some headlight bricks on the bottom and attach 2 1x1 tiles for legs, then tile off the top.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ7/BNFF/JHATYI0C/FZ7BNFFJHATYI0C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY2/VA45/JHATYI2C/FY2VA45JHATYI2C.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 14:"}, {"step": 15, "steps_text": "Build something to catch the ball (I used a Lego soccer ball), add some obstacles, and start playing.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F93/84G2/JHATYIQV/F9384G2JHATYIQV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSR/HKDV/JHATJZB2/FSRHKDVJHATJZB2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 15:"}], "channel": "LEGO"}, {"category": "Play", "description": "Here's how I made custom supports for my son's wooden train track set, to make a spiral ramp that goes 3 'storeys' high (in toy train terms, that is).

The 'easy way' to do this would have been to just 3D print different height supports. However, I didn't like the look of having tall plastic columns all over this lovely wooden play set. And the tallest columns wouldn't fit the printable area in my 3D printer anyway, and even if they could be printed, it would take days to print all of those tall supports individually.\nI realised that really only the 'clip' portion of the piers needs to be 3D printed, to be an accurate and tight 'snap fit' to the tracks. The rest of it can just be a simple timber block. So I just drew up some single clips and double stacked clips in Sketchup, and printed those out in batches. It is so much faster this way - a plate of 8 single clips could print out in about 2 hours.\nThe 3D files are attached here, if anyone is interested. These should fit all the typical compatible train tracks.\nI measured the height of the existing bridges and basic single-tier track supports in the set, which are at 65mm high (base of the track).

Copper is a soft metal which makes it easy to work with. Harder metals will produce cleaner sound, but I personally like the softer tone of copper.

In the \u220510mm tubing, I used the shortest chime (High C) is 100 mm and the longest chime (low C) is 142 mm.

It did the job well, I was really satisfied on the accurateness of the tuning. The chime needs to be hanged from a string when the pitch is tested, otherwise it won't be able to resonate freely. A thin string works best. A thick string will reduce the sustain. I used black sewing thread. Once one length of a specific tone has been determined, determining the rest will become easier. In major C scale intervals between C-D and D-E are whole steps but the interval between E-F is a half step. Intervals between F-G, G-A, and A-B are whole steps, but interval between B-C is again a half step. This means the length difference between E and F & B and C are shorter than with the whole step ones. A tone needs to be approached from below - once it goes over it cannot be lowered, so a lot of testing between the sanding is required. I was surprised on how effectively sand paper grinds copper pipe, no power tools are required in this step. The sand paper I used was 80. It took me little over an hour to get the 8 chimes tuned.

I had an idea to use the magnetized flywheel to \"power\" the chimes, instead of wind or a drum stick. I cut 8 little strips of metal, magnetized them by sweeping them 50+ times to the same direction with a neodymium magnet. Then I measured the middle point and and used a hammer and sharp metal marker to make a little dent to the middle of the strip. After that I placed the metal strips on a tip of a non-ferromagnetic stainless steel screws. This results the metal strip into behaving like a compass needle. I built little hangers out of wood for each chime. Then placed the hangers, chimes, metal strips and screws around the flywheel. Once the flywheel is rotating, the magnetized metal strips will start banging against the chimes resulting into a repeating hypnotic melody with a gradually slowing down tempo. The melody can be modified by changing the places of the chimes and by changing the rotation direction of the flywheel.

I cut some things on wood, engraved from slate, and even made an multi-level topographic map. However, I wanted to do something for myself. There were a ton of users on the GlowForge forums making Settlers of Catan boards, which is awesome. I decided to try something different, and create my own custom Monopoly board, but better yet, an original Star Wars Trilogy Monopoly board. This game will go into my personal collection. It is not for sale.\nHaving recently played Monopoly for the first time in a long time, I thought that I could create pretty much everything needed for a custom Monopoly board with my GlowForge. it ended up being a much bigger project than just creating a custom board, as I also made the tokens, property cards, dice, money, community chest, chance cards, bankers tray, and custom box. My version of the game is based loosely off the Parker Brothers original trilogy Star Wars Monopoly edition, with many variations.\n\"I am one with the Force, and the Force is with me...\"\n*** I used a GlowForge laser cutter using .SVG files from Adobe Illustrator. The files I share in this thread are Illustrator .AI files, which would need to be re-saved as .SVG files to work on a GlowForge.\nThe main materials I used:\n2 x 1/4\" x 12\" x 20\" Cherry Proofgrade Plywood (Game board)\n2 x 1/8\" x 12\" x 20\" Proofgrade Draftboard (Property Cards)\nDifferent Color Cardstock paper for the Money, chance, and community chest cards.\nScrap proofgrade plywood for tokens, houses, and hotels.\nAcrylic paint for property cards and board spaces.\nBlank Dice", "title": "Star Wars Monopoly (GlowForge)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Star-Wars-Monopoly-GlowForge/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Doing a quick google search brought up a number of resources for helping getting started on a personalized version of Monopoly.\nUse the Hasbro My Monopoly website to create a custom board\nPlenty of Etsy sellers with custom boards\nGoogle it.\nI found a few sites with templates as well.\nHobbylark\nBrad Frost Photoshop Template\nSeminopoly Illustrator Template\nI ended up redrawing the entire board, as I didn't find anything that was precise enough to use on my project. Since I knew that I was going to use the GlowForge to score the board grid on the wood, I wanted to ensure that all the lines were joined properly and the exact length. The GlowForge bed is limited to wood that is currently 12\" x 20\". Even though I have the pro model with pass through slot, I wanted a board the would fold up, so ended up making this in 2 halves.\nKnowing that the GlowForge would do a combination of cutting, engraving, and scoring, I kept each of these elements on their own layer in Illustrator, and used different colors for fill and stroke so the GlowForge webapp separates each of these into their own configurable instance.\nI have attached the board grid Illustrator files below.

None of the graphics or artwork is included in those files, just the layout and grid for you to use in your own Monopoly board.***\n*** Since this is a Star Wars monopoly board, I used clip art and images I found through a google image search. I do not own the copyright to these images, and am using them for my own personal use. This instructable is here to show you my process in making this Monopoly board using a GlowForge, but cannot directly share any of the individual trademarked or images that were created by other artists.

The tiles were cut from medium draft board, and will be spray painted with a sealant at some point.

Since I have a bunch of different types of Marbles laying on my terrace I choose the bigger size of pieces whose length is more than 2 feet. For my build, I choose three different colour of stones black brown and white. For the build, my plan was to use brown and white marble to build a chequerboard and the black one is used for making outer boundaries.\nBefore cutting down the main strips I need to straighten the edge of the marble pieces because they have uneven edges. To straighten those pieces I I use a square piece of ply whose width is equal to the bottom plate of the marble cutter. Then I place the marble on some pieces of scrap wood to raise it slightly above from the floor so that blade will not hit the floor. Then with the help of the straight guide, I straighten the edges of my material.\nOnce I straighten all the pieces I cut down the strips 3 inches wide.

If that is the case, it is simple to move the dowel to a new position by just drilling a new hole, and still using the existing lock hole on the other piece to connect the pieces.

The best part is that it is super easy to build with only limited tools!\nOne day I was internet shopping with my friend who needed an electronic pickup for his ukulele. At the checkout, we realised, that we were 8 euros short of the free delivery. Looking through the seller's other items we saw a wooden kazoo that cost 9 euros. Only one euro extra and we could have had a \"free\" kazoo! On a closer inspection, I realised that kazoo is not a very complex instrument. As my woodworking enthusiasm kicked in I did exactly 3 minutes of research and promised to try and build one over the weekend.\nKazoo really is a super simple instrument. It consists of a body which acts as an amplifier, wax paper as a resonator and a little resonator cap which hold the paper in place. That is it! And if you did not know you are supposed to hum into the kazoo, not blow. Always makes me giggle a little when I give this apparatus to my friends for the first time and they do their best to get a sound out of it, only to end up thinking it is some kind of sorcery. The sound coming out of the kazoo to me resembles most a 900 cc superbike passing you on the highway.\nIt is a really great project for beginners as it requires only a few tools and can be built in thirty minutes or less. A great bonus is that it easy to make them in bulk and give out as gifts.\n[GIVEAWAY HAS ENDED! The winner is AnitaV23]\nAs I made a couple kazoos more than I needed I would like to try and make a giveaway right here on the Instructables.

This is something just to reference from! I strongly encourage you to experiment and build a kazoo that feels right for you ;)\nSome questions you might have when building a kazoo\nShould the body be V-shaped? Well, have built many kazoos - V-shaped and not. I have not noticed any difference in sound. It is a purely personal preference if you ask me.\nWhy use bolt and wingnut for the resonator? Why not just glue it down or use screws? Well, the resonator is really fragile - it can be pierced really easily. There is no way to change it once the resonator cap is glued down. Screws would work, but as the walls of the body are really thin there is a good chance that the screw hole becomes loose.\nWhat is the resonator made out of? It is made out of wax paper. Tobacco paper works the best for smaller kazoos. Baking paper is better for bigger ones.

It is really easy as it only consists of four pieces - top/bottom and the sides.\nThere is really no right size for a kazoo (as you may see in the end). It is more of a personal preference. Of course, smaller instruments will make a higher pitched noise and larger ones lower pitched noise. But in the end, I think it does not matter much - kazoo will always be a funny sounding instrument.\nI have found that kazoo around 10-12 cm (5-6 inches) long and 2-3 cm (1 inch) wide seems to be a good size, plus it fits really well in your pocket .\nThe thickness of the top and bottom should be around 3 mm and the sides should be 4-5 mm thick. This way there is plenty of wood to sand off without making the whole thing to brittle.\nThe resonator cap should be also around 3 mm - so you can cut it together with the rest of the parts (top/bottom).\nTip: Use pencils with an eraser as push sticks when cutting small pieces! The eraser gives plenty of grip and you will have good control over the workpiece. When using crosscut sled attach a stop block to your fence(in front of the blade).

Two at each end, one for the resonator and one for holding the resonator cap. For the first two, it is pretty straightforward but the last two you have to drill.\nThe size of your kazoo dictates also the size of the resonator hole. If you are making a kazoo that is 2.5 cm wide means that the hole can be around 16mm. I have found that this instrument is the loudest when the resonator hole is close to the mouth, meaning that it should be near that end in which you plan to hum.\nOn the same line as the resonator hole, you must drill a hole for the bolt. Hole size for the M5 bolt is 5 mm. On my first kazoos, I drilled the hole exactly 5 mm meaning the bolt was loose in there. It meant that it was much harder to tighten down the wingnut as the bolt kept spinning. The solution, of course, is to drill a smaller hole(4.5 mm) so that the bolt locks in there tightly (or you can use superglue).\nThe bolt hole should be around 1.5 cm from the edge of the resonator hole.\nWhen you are already at drilling it is also a good idea to drill holes in the resonator cap. Copy the hole locations from the top part of the kazoo. When the bolt hole for the body should be slightly smaller than the bolt (so it could lock) then the hole in the resonator cap should be bigger so that the cap could spin easily in case you need to change out the resonator. The resonator hole should be as big as the hole in the body but I suggest you make it a few millimetres smaller.

The top and bottom should be cut slightly bigger to allow for any error for example when the pieces slide when clamping down. There is also a great tip that helps prevent this sliding. You are supposed to put some salt on the glue surface before clamping the workpieces together. Just be sure not to put too much salt in there or the glue won't work so well.\nRegular spring clamps work well. I used four of them to get an even pressure.

It allows holding the thin workpiece firmly as you are sanding it.\nDisc sander works great for removing most of the material such as the ends and the sides. Rest of the work has to be done by hand. I started with 120 grit and ended with 180 grit sandpaper. This gave a nice and smooth finish. I also chamfered the edges slightly to make holding it more comfortable.\nTalking about the finish - easiest and prettiest is probably oil.

Wooden dice trays are very nice\u2026 but sometimes table space is limited. It can be awkward for each player to reach the middle of the table to roll dice, be it during D&D, Yahtzee, or some game in between. 3D-printed dice towers are also neat (some 3D models I\u2019ve seen are phenomenal), but not everybody has access to a 3D printer. Likewise, dice tower kits can be bulky to store and transport and may not disassemble well.\nIn recent months, I\u2019ve been intrigued with what talented people can do with just paper, whether it\u2019s with origami, kirigami, pepakura, or even pop-ups. I encourage you to go search YouTube for some examples (this may consume hours to years of your life\u2026 proceed with caution!). I wondered if I could use my interest in paper crafting to help solve the first-world, probably-only-in-my-head \u201cproblem\u201d of the need for a cheap and portable dice tower.\nI decided to come up with a collapsible, easily-stored dice tower that is so cheap and easy to make that every player at the table can afford to have one.

Using a metal ruler edge can be a big help. Crease the paper using a creasing tool (like a Silhouette Spatula, or even a dried-up a ball point pen) against the ruler edge.\n***Quick terminology for the unfamiliar: Valley folds and Mountain folds. These are common origami terms that define the direction in which you fold the paper. A Valley fold points down to form a Valley in the paper. A Mountain fold is exactly the opposite. If you fold a piece of paper in half and open it back out so it resembles an open book, you have made a Valley fold. But folding a piece of paper down the middle to make it stand up on its own like a table tent\u2026 that\u2019s a Mountain fold. I\u2019ll always describe the type of folds relative to the red lines.***\n\nBody of the tower\n(page 1; recommended paper color: gray)\nWhile facing the printed side of the first page, fold the 2 short sides as Valley folds. These flaps will later be glued to a paper base that\u2019s shaped like a baseball home plate.\nThen fold Valley folds on the other 4 taller red lines, keeping the blue lines on the interior of the tower.\nDon\u2019t glue anything yet, though! We\u2019ll need to glue down the interior ramps before sealing up the whole tower.\n\nTops of the tower and the interior ramps\n(page 2; recommended paper color: gray)\nFor the tower tops, Mountain fold the longest edges and the short hinge in between. Valley fold the remaining edges.\nFor each of the ramps, Mountain fold the outer edges, but Valley fold the center line.\n\nForest/guard-rail\n(page 3; recommended paper color: kelly green)\nIf cutting this piece by hand, you certainly don\u2019t have to follow the weird, curvy line. I just drew that to help indicate a treeline. The whole thing will function just as well if you cut a straight lines or even freehand cut where there\u2019s a squiggly line. Fold each of the red lines in the same manner; all Valley folds or all Mountain folds. Either way is fine. Just make sure you make a mirrored set.\nWe will ultimately glue these two pieces together at the smallest point and wrap them around the base. But for now, just cut and fold them.\nBase pieces\n(page 4; paper color: whatever you like, since it is hidden when assembled)\nAfter cutting the top piece out, crease it along each red line (either way). Now fold the piece in half on the shorter fold and glue these two pieces together, so that we have a stiffer piece. (I tend to spread the glue with a scrap piece of cardstock until it\u2019s fairly evenly distributed over the whole surface that will be glued.)\nWhile the glue is still wet, go ahead and fold the whole piece in half again (but don\u2019t glue it again!). When the whole model is disassembled, this piece will fold flat. But when the tower in use, this double-thick \u201chome plate\u201d piece will open up flat at the base of the tower and tuck underneath the heavier piece that we cut from the clipboard.\nFor the very bottom piece, I\u2019ve found it helpful to have the 2 shallow curves cut out because this is where we will tuck the flaps for the forest/guard-rail one the tower is complete.

When gluing flaps down, take care to spread the glue all the way to the edge of a hinge.\nTake one of the ramps from page 2 and glue one of its flaps down alongside the blue lines on the inside of the tower piece from page 1. Keep in mind that the top of the tower is the side that doesn\u2019t have the big 45\u00ba notch taken out of the bottom. It\u2019s possible to glue these ramps down exactly backwards (I\u2019ve done it myself\u2026 and I designed the thing! Be sure to keep the ramps pointy-end tilting up.) So you\u2019ll want to glue the ramps to the tower one hinge at a time, aligning the top hinge of the ramp with the bottom of the blue line.\nI\u2019ve found that it helps to keep the topmost point of the ramp as close as possible to higher end of the blue line (the tower wall hinge side). If you try to center the flap or align the flap more toward the lower end of the blue line, it makes it impossible for the tower to open fully to be a proper rectangle.\nNow that we have each ramp glued down to one side of the still-open tower, let\u2019s apply glue to each remaining ramp flat and fold the tower closed. Press down on the areas where the ramps are glued. Open up the whole thing after several seconds, just to make sure that glue didn\u2019t seep out and affix tower walls together.\nOnce this dries a bit, go ahead and glue down the short flaps on the tower\u2019s long side, just to close the tower up. (The flaps can go on the inside or the outside of the tower; your preference.)\nAfter the main part of the tower is all glued together, let\u2019s glue the top and bottom parts onto it. The \u201chome plate\u201d piece from page 4 gets glued to the bottom flaps of the tower, pointy-side facing backward (\u201cforward\u201d being the opening at the bottom of the tower.) When the tower is collapsed, this \u201chome plate\u201d piece folds in half.\nNow for the tops of the tower. (I could use big words here like ramparts, bastions, and crenelations. But why?) Fold the tower tops on the short hinge, and apply glue to the outside of the bottom flaps. Glue this piece down to the top of the tower, matching flattened hinge side to the flattened hinge of the tower. (Getting this backwards means the model won\u2019t collapse flat and totally defeats the purpose of the entire exercise and should never, ever be done. Twice. By the designer himself. Ugh.)\nWhen folding flat, you\u2019ll see how the two un-fastened edges just slide against each other.\nAt this point, the tower should be finished.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3S/SG46/JEEUGHDN/F3SSG46JEEUGHDN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2X/DTVX/JEEUGHDU/F2XDTVXJEEUGHDU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIB/4HG1/JEEUGHE1/FIB4HG1JEEUGHE1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKC/V87R/JEEUGHE6/FKCV87RJEEUGHE6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF6/Q9XE/JEEUGHEB/FF6Q9XEJEEUGHEB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRK/T2KY/JEEUGHEH/FRKT2KYJEEUGHEH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD6/DZH5/JEEUGHEO/FD6DZH5JEEUGHEO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTK/JVOK/JEEUGHER/FTKJVOKJEEUGHER.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHI/1AZC/JEEUGHF8/FHI1AZCJEEUGHF8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJB/EQ6U/JEEUGHFE/FJBEQ6UJEEUGHFE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCK/KHUV/JEEUGHGP/FCKKHUVJEEUGHGP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0I/RX1G/JEEUGHHU/F0IRX1GJEEUGHHU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX8/9PO4/JEEUGHHX/FX89PO4JEEUGHHX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNR/VMCA/JEEUGHHZ/FNRVMCAJEEUGHHZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVD/65QM/JEEUGHI6/FVD65QMJEEUGHI6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKO/XGFA/JEEUGHIE/FKOXGFAJEEUGHIE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ7/4TTY/JEEUGHIH/FQ74TTYJEEUGHIH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRJ/794R/JEEUGHIO/FRJ794RJEEUGHIO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUF/WX67/JEEUGHIU/FUFWX67JEEUGHIU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F67/KX5T/JEEUGHJE/F67KX5TJEEUGHJE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8L/PG0J/JEEUGHKN/F8LPG0JJEEUGHKN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8W/3NC1/JEEUGHKU/F8W3NC1JEEUGHKU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLY/0RRQ/JEEUGHKZ/FLY0RRQJEEUGHKZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC2/C5ZK/JEEUGHMF/FC2C5ZKJEEUGHMF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLT/5RX4/JEEUGHNO/FLT5RX4JEEUGHNO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5D/53M9/JEEUGHO4/F5D53M9JEEUGHO4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO0/HZSL/JEEUGHOB/FO0HZSLJEEUGHOB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEY/LYG2/JEEUGHOH/FEYLYG2JEEUGHOH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Gluing Pieces Together"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "So now we\u2019re left with only that one piece of cardstock from page 4 with the little shallow curves. So what do we do with that? First, we get our clipboard. Then, we trace the outline of the whole piece onto a clipboard (just make a straight line on the long sides; don\u2019t include the shallow curves in your traced line).\nUsing your jigsaw (or coping saw), cut this shape out of your chipboard clipboard to form a base for your tower. (Hey, the whole thing can\u2019t be made of paper! I mean it could\u2026 but it would fall over at the first sign of a D20.) I find that a jigsaw is a better choice than a coping saw for cutting out the base, but use what you have! (Heck, you could likely CNC cut the base if you like; but just like with those aforementioned 3D printers, not everyone has access to such.) As always, count your fingers and toes when using a saw and make sure you have the same number of digits before and after cutting. (Seriously, be smart when using power tools. Goggles, earplugs, steady working area\u2026 you know the steps.) If my math is right, you *should* be able to get 3 total bases out of 1 clipboard. I assume you\u2019ll be making at least one Dice Tower for each person you\u2019ve known since kindergarten. But maybe I\u2019m wrong.\nRemember that last piece of cardstock from 2 paragraphs ago? Go get it now that you\u2019re down cutting out your clipboard base! Line the base up against the cardstock and wrap some clear tape all the way around to the other side. Use the blue lines as guides for your tape, keeping the inner edge of the tape in line with the edge of the shallow curves. Put another strip of tape around the triangular edge, leaving a \u201csleeve\u201d open at the end.(If your tape is a different width, that\u2019s OK; just tape straight against the inside of the blue lines.)\nNow let\u2019s glue the cardstock down onto the base\u2026 but only the rounded edge!

All that\u2019s left is the felt and the brace. Line up a long edge of the base to an edge of the peel & stick felt. Leave a little margin on the other long side and cut out a section of felt big enough for the whole base. If you plan well and don\u2019t cut *too* wide, you should be able to get 3 bases worth of felt out of one 8.5\"x 11\" sheet of peel & stick felt. Go ahead and stick it down and trim it up! Be sure to stick the felt on the non-cardstock side!\nNow all that\u2019s left to \u201cbuild\u201d is the brace. Push your tower to the full open position until the opening seems relatively square and measure the diagonal distance inside. It should be something like 3.5\", but check your model to be sure. Find a popsicle stick and measure a 3.5\" segment in the middle (don\u2019t use the rounded edges within this measurement).\nNow mark roughly another .25\" on the outside of each of your marks.\nGo ahead and cut the ends off of the stick to these outermost marks, making it a 4\" stick, give or take. (I prefer using an X-Acto for this since I find it easiest to control, even though it takes several passes and will dull your blade pretty quickly.) Then cut halfway up the stick at the 3.5\" marks. Then cut lengthwise to allow for 2 tabs, so your final piece will have 2 \u201cnotches\u201d up top that stick out .25\" each.\nPress the front and back corners of the tower to open it up and slide the double-thick \u201chome plate\u201d piece at the bottom into the \u201csleeve\u201d between the clipboard and the cardstock that\u2019s affixed to it. Wedge the wooden brace in between the two unconnected halves of the tower\u2019s top, and the whole tower should stay open and rigid.\nThe tower is done, but your dice might go anywhere (even off the table). So let\u2019s add the guard-rail \u201cforest.\u201d Insert the longer tabs of the guard-rail into the shallow curves underneath the clipboard.

The tail of your glider can be the same shape as your wings, just smaller! The information below comes form NASA's K-12 Wing Design Curriculum .\nRectangular Wing: A rectangular wing is used on slower aircraft, typically training aircraft. It is somewhat maneuverable but allows for a high margin of pilot error. It also produces a large amount of lift so that the wing can be smaller in comparison to the body of the aircraft.\nElliptical Wing: An elliptical wing is similar to the rectangular wing but is usually lighter and generates much more lift. It is often found on gliders and ultra-light aircraft.\nSwept Wing: Swept wings are usually found on jet aircraft. The thinner profile produces less drag, meaning it can fly at faster speeds.

You get to make your terrain look however you like! If you want, you can stop reading here and go for your own color scheme. If you want to see how I got my terrain looking the way I did, though, by all means keep reading!\nThe first step in our process is basecoating. For this, I used Citadel Base paints. If you do decide to use Citadel paints, however, you must (almost) ALWAYS thin your paints with a bit of water. For a more in-depth tutorial on the how (and why!) of thinning your paints, check out the included video from WarhammerTV.\nFor the tree, I originally used two thin coats of Zandri Dust, covered with a generous layer of Agrax Earthshade wash. However, this looked more like old wood than the creepy, bleached-bone look that I wanted, so instead I painted over this with two thin coats of Ushabti Bone.\nThis looked much better than the previous color, so I then proceeded to use Seraphim Sepia to fill in the recessed, naturally-darker parts of the miniature--this does a great job of bringing out the details of your miniature, and making it look even more three-dimensional than it already is.\nFor an excellent demonstration of how to use your shade paints, check out the included video.\nOnce I did that, I returned to my Ushabti Bone, using this to re-paint the areas which I wanted to better stand out from the shaded parts, and with that the tree itself was complete!\nFollowing this, I used a stiff brush and a plastic fork to apply Vallejo's Thick Brown Mud to the base--this creates a churned-up, muddy look that would look right at home in the World War I battlefields of the Somme and Verdun. Don't bother thinning this paint down--we want it to be as thick as possible!\nOnce your Thick Brown Mud has dried (which will take much longer than your other paints!) take a wide, dry brush, dip just the tips of its bristles, and dip them in the thick, jellylike substance that is Underhive Ash paint. Brush the bristles on a paper towel until ALMOST all the paint is off the brush, and then swipe the brush gently over the mud. This drybrushing technique will catch the raised details in the mud, and serve to give it more definition.\nIf you want to go the extra mile and make this thing look like it's growing from a toxic swamp, while it's still wet, hollow out a little divot or two in the mud with your application tool, let it dry, and drybrush as before. Then, paint some Caliban Green in the bottoms of the divots. Follow this up with several thin layers of Nurgle's Rot, a thin, soupy paint that will look more or less like wet snot, even when it's dry.\nAs a final touch, I decided to add just a little bit of Citadel's Blood For The Blood God paint in some of the interior recesses of the tree--it is called a \"vampire tree\" after all! I went with the idea that this thing is kind of a \"bloody sponge,\" soaking up blood from the battlefield. As such, I put just a little of it in the round recesses in the interior of the tree, to make it look like just a little blood was seeping out. The paint, when dry, still looks like fresh, wet blood, and is by far one of my favorite paints that I own. The key is to use it SPARINGLY--if you get carried away, it will start to look fake and the effect will be lost!\nAnd, finally, there's the finished product, with a few of my Death Korps of Krieg guardsmen standing next to it for scale!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ1/F47K/JE94PBM9/FZ1F47KJE94PBM9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMN/7VEU/JE94OZME/FMN7VEUJE94OZME.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F79/PDCS/JE94OZE2/F79PDCSJE94OZE2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO7/NQWU/JE94PBNG/FO7NQWUJE94PBNG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHY/E6ZP/JE94PBOP/FHYE6ZPJE94PBOP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRH/JYW7/JE94PBS0/FRHJYW7JE94PBS0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU7/87LS/JE94PBQW/FU787LSJE94PBQW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTI/9ESY/JE94OZB5/FTI9ESYJE94OZB5.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Step 5: Painting the Tree!"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "The first paint that I used for the trench was Leadbelcher, which I thinned down and then applied in two thin coats (see the previous step for the video instructions on how to do this). I used this to paint all the parts of this trench which I wanted to be metal (i.e. floors, walls).\nFollowing this, I used some of Vallejo's Light Brown Mud, mixing it with Reaper's Field Grey and Ash Grey paints, then dabbing this all over the parts of the model which I wanted to look like dirt piled up in a berm against the side of the trench.

Round the edges of the base (if desired and you have the equipment).\n5. Cut a piece of 1 1/4\" wood dowel, 5\" long.\n6. Make a mark 1 1/2\" from one end.\n7. Draw a line, \u00bc\u201d in, from the top down to the 1 \u00bd\u201d marks. An easy way to do this is place the dowel in a clamp in between two pieces of scrap wood to act as walls. Place the clamp on the bottom 1 \u00bd\u201d segment. Then set a piece of \u00bc\u201d board on edge on top of the dowel on each side against the scrap piece of wood to make the mark. Keep the clamp in place until step #9.\n8. Cut the 1/4\" sides of the dowel down to the 1 1/2\" mark. The top of the dowel should now be 3/4\" thick.\n9. Turn the dowel 90\u00b0on its side. Draw the slot as shown.\n10. If you have the tools/skills to make the slot without the cutting the pole in half you can proceed to step #15.\nTo remove the wood from the slot, we\u2019ll cut it in half and remove the wood. Then we\u2019ll glue it back together.\nDraw a line across the slot somewhere near the middle to mark where to make the cut. The placement of this line is not critical.\n11. Cut the dowel on the line just drawn.\n12. Use whatever tools you have to clean out the slot (Bandsaw, Scroll saw, etc.).\n13. Now glue the slot back together.\n14. Sand the glue joint and round off the top of the slot. Make the inside of the slot as smooth as you can make it.\n15. We need a \u201cBall\u201d in front of each disk to prevent the disk from passing through the slot at the wrong time. Cut two \u00be\u201d pieces of 5/8\u201d dowel. Drill a \u00bc\u201d hole through the center. The \u201cBall\u201d can be made from any wood dowel size that won\u2019t pass through the slot but 5/8\u201d is close enough to look like it should pass through the slot which adds to the complexity of the puzzle.\nRemember to make two of them.\n16. Temporarily insert a piece of 1/4\" dowel into one end of the ball.\n17. Using the 1/4\" dowel as a handle, round off the end of the ball. Then insert the 1/4\" dowel into the other end of the ball and round off the opposite end. Round off both balls.\n18. Draw two 1 \u00be\u201d disks on 3/8\u201d stock or draw them on paper and glue them to the stock. Before you cut the disks, drill a 3/16\u201d hole, ~3/8\u201d deep, in the edge of each disk. This will be used to attach the rope to the disk.\nWhen you cut the two disks, cut them slightly larger than required. That will allow you to sand them down to a smooth reasonable round surface.\nRemove the paper (if used) and sand the outside perimeter on both sides of each disk.\nYou may want to consider painting each disk and ball set a different color to make it a little easier to keep track of the disk movements while solving the puzzle.\n19.

That Timeout box basically is a timer of 60 seconds with a countdown. We can see examples from some of the most know brands in this sport in the pictures.\n\nSuch a timer costs around $300 which I believe is bloody expensive. So I decided to give it a try to build my on.\n\nBeing a maker, but not someone skilled enough in electronics, I had to find a way to speed up the process. The natural choice would be to use an arduino but to be honest I haven't done anything on that field yet, so I started a different route and used a 555 timer integrated circuit from a DYI kit that I found online.\n\nMy approach does not include the visible count-down. I consider that the most important thing is to warn the players when the time is up. This is even more important when sometimes some referees may be amateur (and perhaps shy), and they lack the authority to force athletes to respect the rules, so this will naturally help.\n\nRemember I wanted this to be very low cost, so the compromise I did (low cost assuming I don't have the visible countdown) seems pretty acceptable to me.\n\nIf I was doing it for the Timeout counting, I might as well include the Warm-up period in the same device.\n\nThe video shows the final outcome.", "title": "Table Tennis (Timeout / Warm Up) Timer", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Table-Tennis-Timeout-Warm-Up-Timer/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I bought from eBay a DYI kit that basically uses an 556 Integrated Circuit (IC) which according to their explanation is basically two 555 ICs in a single IC.

I thought a green led showing it is working would be nicer. I had some old leds at home, I've checked online if the voltages were the same and as they seemed to be, I just replaced the red led for the green led.\n2) The second thing I did (and in order to reduce costs) was to try to do both the Timeout and Wamup settings using just a single circuit.\n\nI started by measuring the variable resistors value in each circuit to get the number of ohms needed at each circuit. Then I've looked for the equivalent fixed resistors and I've chose the minimum value needed for each circuit.\n\nThen I've added a single switch (2 circuits - one for the timer and the other for the buzzer) and according to the switch position I've added the remaining resistors to have the maximum value of ohms needed when the switch was on each position (either Timeout or Warmup). In haste, in one of the positions of the switch I had to do nothing and the resistance was already the needed for one of the positions; in the other position, the additional resistors would be in series with the base ones and the sum of them would give the value needed for the second circuit.\nActivities 1 and 2 are depicted in the picture.\n\n3) Finally I thought that while the buzzer is working, it would be nice to light up some red leds also. I was not sure on how to accomplish this because of the current (amperage) needed but I decided to experiment and see what would happen. So I've looked for 4 red leds and searched online how to include them looking at the schematics.\nFrom my research, connecting them in parallel with the buzzer would be the best option. So even tough I've also experimented putting them in series, I went for the parallel connection. I've soldered a 390ohm resistor to each led on its positive pole (I think online the recommendation was to use 370 ohm but I did not had such resistors at hand) and I've tested it. It worked and because this works only for a couple of seconds while it is buzzing, I doubt I'll have many problems. But time will tell. Obviously, use it at your own risk as I am no expert in the field. I've drilled some holes in empty places in the circuit board and just using solder I've patched all the connections needed.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLJ/50AN/JD2F8EYL/FLJ50ANJD2F8EYL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5I/4H0I/JD2F8EXH/F5I4H0IJD2F8EXH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Changing the DYI Kit"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "For the box I've just thought that it would be nice to try to get something similar in shape to the original timers from the big brands.\n\nI went to a regular chinese drug store (very common over here) and just bought a wood enclosure for this purpose.\n\nI also bought some tiny magnets and glued them to keep the box closed.\n\nApart from that, I had to drill the holes for the switches, the leds and the buzzer. Here I did a mistake which was to drill first and only draw the artworks afterwards which became much harder to fine-tune.

We had to spray some lacker first to ensure it would glue better and also heat it up a bit by using an heat gun or hair dryer. Another option would be to paint the box before putting the vinyl. All that helps to glue it better and remove the wood embossing.\n- it would have been better to only drill the holes for the switches and leds at the end. It would have given more flexibility.\n- Most important, the vinyl should have been protected with a sheet of transparent plastic to make sure that the black ink does not get scratched.
