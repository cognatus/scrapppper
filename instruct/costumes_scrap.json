All I did to make mine look more spiky was put some hairspray on my fingers and pinch the ends of a few strands to give them a little definition.

If you'd like to go that route, skip to the next step.\n3d modeling is a long and complicated process that I won't get too in depth with here, but I will share with you a few tips and tricks that apply to this project in particular.\nBefore actually diving into the model, step back and think about how exactly you are going to break it up for 3d printing. I try to reduce the amount of seams by using natural lines in the object itself. Another consideration is the color of each area. I typically have different colored parts separate, to make the painting and finishing process easier. The size of the parts varies based on the bed size of your 3d printer. I have Prusa MK2Ss so I typically keep parts under 8\", slightly less if they are interlocking.\nMy 3d modeling software of choice is Autodesk Fusion 360. It's free for hobbyists and has several different workspaces that allow for different types of modeling styles. The folks over at Autodesk have a bunch of great tutorials to help you get started.\nMy usual workflow is as follows:\n1. Setting up the canvas(es)\n2. General massing of parts\n3. Details and more details\n4. Internals (Channels for LEDs/Wiring/Electronics, this could be combined with step 5 depending)\n5. Splitting the parts for 3d printing / creating snap joints and/or pins (I usually do a new \"save as\" of my model before this step for archiving purposes)\n6.

I'm not going to explain the 3d printing process as every printer is different, but here is an overview on 3d printing with transparent filaments.\nThe parts that are backlit with LEDs were printed with a transparent \"natural\" colored PETG. Natural, undyed PETG (or PLA) is a light, transparent color, similar to clear acrylic that has been frosted (sanded). When layered, this is great for diffusing LEDs.\nThere are several considerations to keep in mind when printing with transparent filament. It can be sanded but no filler can be used. Since light is being diffused by it, the printed parts need to be solid, with no infill grids/honeycomb showing (printed at 100% or 0% infill). To get the smoothest surface possible on the side that is seen, I printed the teeth in half, with the exterior face down on the bed. When a printer is adjusted properly, the first layer of a print should mimic the smoothness of the printer surface. This made the exterior of the teeth smooth with no print lines. I printed these at a 150 micron (.15mm) layer height but you could do less if you want a smoother edge.\nPETG can be tricky to print with and requires a full metal nozzle and heated bed due to the higher print temperatures required. It is prone to warping if conditions aren't optimal and I usually print slightly slower as well to make sure it adheres to both the bed and itself appropriately. Transparent PLA is an easier option, but I prefer the look of transparent PETG. Either works, use what works best for you (and your printer)!\nThere are 11 \"teeth\" with spacers that make up the \"blade\" portion of the Bladesaw. These were all printed in halves, for a total of 22 pieces printed with \"natural\" (transparent) PETG. I did several tests (the final one is the first picture) and ended up with a 1/8 inch (3.18 mm) shell. They were printed at 100% infill and while still hefty, 1/8\" was the sweet spot.\nThe orange parts were printed with a transparent orange PETG and were printed solid. These didn't actually have LEDs behind them but when the light hits it, they appear have a slight glow to them.\nThe rest of the parts were printed in silver PLA, using both Hatchbox and Inland filament, on two Prusa i3 MK2S 3d printers.\nOther methods considered for the teeth were vacuum forming and clear resin casting, but were both expensive and time consuming methods.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXP/JYJ3/JQGYDOTI/FXPJYJ3JQGYDOTI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPG/ZWG3/JQGYDP3B/FPGZWG3JQGYDP3B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7K/2R35/JQGYDOU4/F7K2R35JQGYDOU4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBW/D3W2/JQGYDOVG/FBWD3W2JQGYDOVG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEV/FLEC/JQGYDOTU/FEVFLECJQGYDOTU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCS/QII0/JQGYDOUM/FCSQII0JQGYDOUM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: 3d Printing (with Transparent Filament)"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Now that you've got some parts 3d printed, it's time to move on to the step I like to refer to as: Eat. Sleep. Sand Repeat.\nMy previous Instructable Noctis' Engine Blade goes in depth on this process. I want to teach additional techniques with these Instructables, not repeat myself. Check that out for details, but here is an outline of the process I typically use:\n1. Initial prep work (gluing certain parts together, cleaning dust off of the surface)\n2. Filler primer (and/or Spot Filler Putty, depending on your preference)\n3. Wet sanding (see step 4 of my previous instructable for the breakdown, I like to use a tub as picture above)\n4. More filler primer (and/or \"spot filler putty\")\n5. More wet sanding\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until smooth (increasing grit as you go, I usually start with 220 and move up to 400)\n7. Primer (matte black primer, compatible with plastics)\n8. One last wet sanding at a higher grit (I usually do 800, unless it's a gloss finish, then go higher)\n9. Another layer of matte or gloss black primer\nAlright, still with me? You may be thinking \"Brian, that's a lot of work, isn't there a quicker or easier way to get smooth 3d printer parts!?!\"\nIn short, no. You can make it easier on yourself by printing parts at a higher resolution (100 or 50 microns if you have the time) and that may reduce the amount of filler you need. Cleaning up 3d printed parts time time and effort. If you don't want layer lines to show, you need to put in the time and elbow grease. There are other methods and materials, such as XTC-3D, wood filler, etc, but you will still need to do a ton of sanding, and I've had mixed results with those anyway.\nTake this step with a grain of salt and find what works for you.\nDisclaimer: I have a spray booth that vents outside of my shop and I still use a rated respirator and eye protection when using spray paint and airbrushes.

Sleep. Sand. Repeat)"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "This step is always one of my favorites. Here is where we see the prop come to life with color and texture!\nFor the Ancient Bladesaw I used two techniques for getting the final finishes: \"dry-brushing\" and textured spray paint.\nDry-brushing is painting with a \"dry\" paint brush. If you haven't used the technique before that probably sounds ridiculous. It can be achieved using various paints and in multiple applications (such as weathering) but for this project I used it to get a worn metallic finish on the gold and silver pieces. I used Hard Body Acrylic paints by Liquitex. Rich Gold/Silver is your main paint, with the corresponding bright gold/silver as a highlight. If you want to give additional accents and highlights, mix a tiny amount of blue or red into the bright gold/silver to give it a slight color variation. Each of these steps takes practice to find the right balance. Practice this process on a scrap piece first to get the technique down.\nHow to dry-brush:\nWhen starting this process, your part should be primed with either a glossy black primer or a matte black primer depending on what level of shine you are going for. I used a matte black because I wanted a worn, dull finish.\nI like to use a piece of cardboard as a palette. Squeeze out a thin line of paint. Gently dab a little bit of paint on the tip of your paintbrush.\nLightly dab your paintbrush on the palette until there's only a light amount of paint left on the paintbrush.\nSince this isn't dry-brushing for weathering but as a top coat, use long, light brush strokes over the surface, barely touching it, but enough so there is contact. This process takes a while, but will give you a nice brushed metal look. This will take a few passes since you are using minimal paint. Be patient, don't get frustrated or start using too much paint. The end result is worth it.\nFor the bulk of the body, the Ancient Bladesaw appears to have an \"earthy\" and \"wood-like\" appearance. I'm told that it's actually stone or pottery based on a Japanese style of pottery known as Jomon. To achieve this look I did a few different test methods, eventually settling on Rustoleum Multicolor Textured spray paint in \"Autumn Brown.\" I've used this technique on grips for a handgun to make it look like \"wood\" and it's an easy way to cover a large surface quickly.\nLike dry-brushing, this process starts with a black primer. I used matte black primer for this.\nSpray a coat of the multi-color textured spray paint on your part. Be careful not to over do it, this paint goes on very thick. It may look like a weird oatmeal at first but will dry as an even coat. Don't panic, let it dry fully before moving to the next step.\nThe textured paint isn't as dark as I wanted, so I did a light wet sanding with 400 grit. Be careful not to overdo it or you'll take off too much paint. Be gentle with the sanding, you just want to lightly scuff the surface.\nAfter your part has dried off it's time to do a light color wash. If you aren't familiar with a \"color wash\" here's a quick rundown. A color wash is a quick and easy way to weather your props. I used a black color wash to darken the overall top coat. Time for a step by step inside of a step. It's \"learnception.\"\nA color wash uses standard acrylic paints, such as Liquitex basics or the off brand equivalent. You're going to be mixing this heavily with water, so it doesn't need to be expensive paint. If this is your first time, pick out a brown (such as burnt umber) and a black (ivory black). Little plastic paint mixing cups are also handy for this process. If you're at the craft store anyway, pick a few of those up.\nIf you want to take this a step further, pick up the standard primary colors (red/yellow/blue). They are usually named \"primary red/yellow/blue.\" I don't know a lot about color theory, but I do know if you mix those three together, it makes brown. Test out different ratios to get different hues of brown. Think about where your prop would have been and what color dirt would be there.\nNow that you have your paint ready, put a little in your plastic cup. Put approximately the same ratio of water in the cup as paint. Mix them together! The ratio to paint varies depending on how dirty you want to make your prop. Since this is mixed with water, it will flow into crevices and nooks, naturally weathering it.\nLike I've mentioned before, practice this on a test piece before actually doing it to your finished prop. I like to use a paint brush to dab a little of the mixture from the cup onto to the prop. Use a paper towel (I use blue shop paper towels for this) to lightly smear and wipe up the mixture. If you let the paint set for a minute or two, more will be left behind. Think of this like intentionally smearing grime onto your prop. Using various color mixtures will give it more layers of grime but be careful not to overdo it. Odds are your prop wasn't laying in a swamp for 20 years (unless it's from Fallout, then maybe it was).\nI keep a pile of latex gloves from Harbor Freight handy at all times. The paint you're using for this is acrylic so it washes off easily, but I wear gloves anyway.\nApply several washes to get the color your heart desires. For this project I didn't actually do any weathering since the top coats were weathered, but both dry-brushing and color washes can be used to do surface weathering.\nAt this point let's assume you're done with your top coat. Congrats! Before you pop that Champagne (or sparkling cider) don't forget to clear coat your parts. You can clear coat now or after full assembly, that's up to you. I use Liquitex spray varnish or Rust-oleum clear coats. Matte, semi-gloss, or gloss are your choices, depending on what you want the final prop to look like. The clear coat seals in your weathering and gives it a protective layer.\nI've ruined many a paint job in my day, here's a few tips and tricks to avoid having to sand off your top coat and start from primer.\nPractice on scraps. I sound like a broken record but seriously, practice first. Test your paints in layers before applying them to a final part, from primer to final coat.\nAlways use a primer appropriate for the type of material you're painting. Read the labels. A primer is designed to adhere to specific surfaces and creates a binding layer between the paint and the part. For 3d printed parts use a primer compatible with plastic.\nWarm paint sprays better. If you're using spray paint, fill a small container with \"warm\" water and let the can of spray paint sit in the warm water for a few minutes.\nDo light passes. More coats are better than spraying paint too heavy and having to sand off a bad coat. Be patient.\nIf you use spray paint, get one of these. Your hands will thank you.\nWear a respirator and only use spray paint in a well ventilated area. I have a spray booth that I built for around $100 that vents outside of my shop, I highly recommend going that route if you have room. I'll do an Instructable documenting that process next.\nDon't be afraid to try out different paints, textures, and techniques.

Take it with a grain of salt and experiment with them!\nThe battery we are going to use for this is a 3.7v Lithium Ion battery, but the Neopixels and the Trinket run off 5 volt. Brian that math doesn't add up. Nope, it sure doesn't. This is where the POWERBOOST 500C (PB500C) comes in. The battery connects to that board and it converts the battery output to 5.2v, which is then connected to the Trinket. Huzzah! Now we're cooking with coconut oil.\nAlright, so now that we kind of understand what's going on, let's start soldering things together. If you are rusty or don't have a lot of experience soldering, practice on a breadboard first. I like using red for positive/5v, black for negative/ground, and green for data lines. That keeps things nice and neat. 22AWG wire works great for this. (Wire gauge is backwards, the bigger the number, the smaller the wire). Refer to my chart above for the wiring diagram.\nSolder the positive and negative on the PB500C to the positive and negative on the Trinket (reverse side).\nSolder wires to the GND (ground) and 5V to the powerboost. Solder the corresponding wires to the LED strip.\nSolder a green wire to the data (\"din\" center pin) on the LED strip. Attach this to the 6 pin on the Trinket.\nIf you want to use a switch to turn the power on and off, solder the center pin of the switch to the EN pin on the PB500C and bottom pin of the switch to the GND pin (right below the EN pin).\nPlug in your battery to the PB500C.\nWait. Nothing happened?! Don't worry, you haven't programmed the code yet for the Neopixels. This is normal.\nI am not experienced enough with this next section to try to explain it to you. Arduino code is a foreign language to me and I am still learning. I will defer to the below resources on the setup process of the software and code required. Feel free to leave any questions below and I will do my best to point you in the right direction!\nAdditional resources:\nKamui cosplay has a wonderful ebook with an introduction to Neopixels. Buy her books.\nAdafruit has an awesome \"Uberguide\" to Neopixels\nTweaking4All.com has a great guide to different Arduino codes for Neopixels. This is what I used to learn how to adapt codes for different effects.\nA few quick tips for dealing with Neopixels\nTake your time. This isn't a quick process. If you aren't willing to be patient, use standard 12V LED strips, it will cause far less of a headache and heartbreak for you.\nPractice soldering before actually soldering onto the boards / LEDs. Buy a breadboard and practice your solder points. Invest in a decent soldering iron with a nice tip. Tin the tip before use.\nWhile learning to use the arduino code, an Arduino Uno is quicker to test code on. Use a test strip of LEDs to test your code.\nUse heat shrink to cover the connections of the LED strips. It's a quick and easy way to make sure everything stays nice and neat.

At this point I had two halves of the main body, one with the LED strip and teeth attached to it at, and one without the teeth.\nI've been working on getting snap tolerances as close as possible and this was a stress test of those skills. Luckily every groove fit together and I heard the satisfying click of the pins locking together.\nAn important note about snap fitting joints: when painting, either mask the joints (they aren't going to be seen anyway) or take care to avoid getting paint in/on them. I had to go back and sand paint off several areas to get pieces to fit together. The tolerances I mentioned early do not account for paint, only the shrinkage of the filament. You could add a little extra wiggle room but that's hard to gauge.\nThe parts making up the halves themselves were glued together but the two separate halves are held together by the pins, no glue.

Yes, 1845 is completely the wrong era for English pirates, but it's still the cutlass everyone knows from movies and storybook illustrations. You can see this in the screenshots I took from one of my favourite movies, the 1990 version of Treasure Island (probably the best pirate movie ever made...) As far as I'm concerned this makes it the quintessential literary pirate cutlass.\nUnfortunately, originals are very expensive and no one makes a replica, at least not available in Britain, so I decided to make my own. But I don't have the chops to make my own blade so I decided to borrow the blade from a different sword. Katanas are about the right shape and are readily available (although the government is clamping down on them again this year *fume*) so I bought the cheapest one I could find, \u00a350 delivered.\nA katana blade is quite long, and the handle is much too long for a cutlass, so I cut the end off the tang with a hacksaw and further used a file to eat into the blade by a further two inches or so. This brought the actual blade length down to 25 inches which looks right to me. Because it was a cheap katana the cutting edge is not hardened, so it was easy to file.\nTo remove the hamon (the milky pattern along the cutting edge) I dipped it into a strong solution of potassium permanganate for about eight minutes. You can buy this very cheaply online because it is used for etching circuit boards. I used half a litre in a bit of PCV pipe. The blade turned completely black (and got very hot during the etching process!) but after sanding the oxide off with some wet and dry paper I was left with a pleasing antique-looking finish, and no hamon.", "title": "Turn a Katana Into a Cutlass", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Turn-a-Katana-Into-a-Cutlass/", "section": "costumes", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The hilt began as a piece of 1.5mm thick steel. The piece I used was nickel plated because that's what I had, but it would have been better to use plain steel since the nickel coating messed with my blackeneing method (see later). I made a cardboard template and used it to cut out the shape with a hacksaw and file. I also drilled and filed out a hole for the tang to fit through.\nTo create the bowl or cup shape I used a piece of timber (a bit of fence post actually) and gouged a shallow depression into it. Placing the steel over the depression and gently hammering it with a ball-end hammer quickly caused it to curl up and take shape -in fact I was surpsied how easy this was! I also hammered the edges of the hilt over a piece of steel bar so they fold in the reverse direction, which strengthens the thin part of the hilt (in retrospect it would be easier to do this part first while the steel is still flat). Once I was happy with the shape and size I made another hole in the thin end of the hilt for the peg on the end of the tang to fit into (if this doesn't make sense see later for how it is all constructed).\nI then filed and sanded out most of the hammer marks (at least on the outside of the hilt) which also removed the nickel coating (or so I thought).\nApparently Naval cutlasses were painted black. However, I'm somewhat skeptical that they used regular paint back then, so I used an alternative traditional method of blackening with boiled linseed oil. The process is simple: clean the steel thoroughly with wire wool and acetone to remove any grease. Then heat the reverse side of the metal with a blowlamp and paint the linseed oil (use boiled, not raw linseed oil) on the other side. When it gets hot enough the oil will start to smoke and 'bake' on. Repeat this a couple of times and you will be left with a durable black coating that looks just like black satin paint! I did get trouble with traces of the nickel flaking off as it heated up, leaving un-blackened patches. Fortunately this is only visible on the inside of the hilt and rust may hide it later, but I learned my lesson: use only plain steel!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FC5/9LSX/JS0ORQX4/FC59LSXJS0ORQX4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F81/U4OJ/JS0OV3CQ/F81U4OJJS0OV3CQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTJ/LO5L/JS0OV3EI/FTJLO5LJS0OV3EI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F50/GPIA/JS0OV3H0/F50GPIAJS0OV3H0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3R/GP4O/JS0OV3IS/F3RGP4OJS0OV3IS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Making the Hilt"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The handle I made from a piece of scrap beechwood, but any wood would work.

This helps to absorb any shock to the handle during the peening process, and also compresses to fill any gap between the handle and hilt.\nI also made a brass washer thing to fit above the hilt to hide the less-than-perfect hole where the tang slides into the hilt, plus it's a cool detail.\nFinally I made a peening block. This is a piece of thick (4mm) steel that slips over the peg on the end of the tang, which allows you to hammer or 'peen' the peg over without hammering all over the nicely-made hilt. A subtle detail is that the hole in the peening block should be filed at an angle; this means the peened metal will mushroom over and form a wedge which cannot come loose (you can see what I mean in the next step).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTW/DXHP/JS0OV3AY/FTWDXHPJS0OV3AY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXM/9X33/JS0OV3MC/FXM9X33JS0OV3MC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ6/PTKV/JS0OV3KK/FZ6PTKVJS0OV3KK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Making the Handle and Peening Block"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I assembled the component parts, stood the sword on a block of wood and proceeded to peen the peg with a ball-end hammer.

Yuo have to make sure that the glue you're using isn't elastic, because you don't want your prop to bend in the middle of a ComicCon, while everyone is admiring your Halo Master Chief laser gun or something as embarrasing as this. You should also read the glue's instructions properly to make sure that the glue you're using isn't toxic. If necessary, wear a safety respirator.\nOnce your prop has its final shape, you should cover i t with a fine layer of body filler. This body filler can be in form of spray or brush Paint. You can use an specific for 3D printed pieces body filler, like XTC-3D; or you can use some buolding body filler you can find in any hardware store. You have to make sure that the body filler isn't very dense, and that it can be applied into the type of plastic you prop is made.\nAfter the body filler is dry, you have to sand all the piece using some sandpaper. A 200 roughness sandpaper will be a good one to start sanding your piece. After the sanding, you should cover the prop with other layer of body filler, and sand it again with a lower roughness sandpaper.

If you are not happy with your plain and sad creation, continue reading. Here is were the magic that gives life to your creations starts!!!\nLets start from the beginning. Normally, all the props have a different base color than bodyfiller's one, so its time to paint your piece. In this point you should make a decission. If you want your prop to look like an old metal piece, wich has parts were the original paint has dissapeared revealling the silvered metal that was covering, you should jum to the \"Simulating old metal\" step. If you are not interested in giving your prop this aspect, I invite you to continue reading.\nIt's time to give your creation the first layer of color. This Will be the base color, that will cover the bigger surface. In this step, i highly recomend you to use a spray paint. They are cheap and can be used to cover big surfaces in a short period of time. You can choose the color you prefer, and you can always look for external references to show to your nearest paint shop employee, and he Will help you choosing themost similar colour. Also, if your prop has the same color that the body filler you've used, I recommend you covering the prop with a layer of that colour spaypaint, because its easier to apply different types of paint over a sparypaintlayer than over an industrial body filler.\nYou should always remember that, if you are using spraypaints, you have to work in a ventilated \u00e1rea, being aware of not painting food or things you are going to put in contact with your body. You should also wear a respirator and safety glases. I cant grant you that spraying Paint into your eye by mistake isn't a funny experience.\nOnce your prop has that shiny colour that represents it, you can go to the next step.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZW/UBEK/JSL38MPV/FZWUBEKJSL38MPV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUN/X02X/JSL38N36/FUNX02XJSL38N36.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F24/FFAO/JSL38N3N/F24FFAOJSL38N3N.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Second Step: Primary Colours"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Now you have a shiny and almost ready prop, but normally, almost every cosplay object has at least two or three colour that gives details and realism to the prop. This is the step whre you shou show to the world your painting abilities, or at least look for someone who isn't as horrble as you while having a paintbrush on its hands.\nWhen you are applying a second colour to a prop, you don't want the parts that you've alrady painted to get covered by tha new colour. First of all, you should cover the parts you don't want to be repainted with masking tape. If the \u00e1reas to cover are very big, you can also use paper towels and glue them to the prop with masking tape in the borders and difficult areas. This could become a very tedious part, but I can grant you that, the more patient you have covering all the details, the better the final result will be. Having said that, I can't give you more detailed advice of wich part should be covered, because every prop is different. The only thing I can say you is to be patient and prepare to have a good time olaying with scissors, paper towels and masking tape.\nOnce you've covered all the parts you dont want to be painted, you can apply the second layer of Paint. In this step, I suggest you to use acrylic Paint. It's easier to apply using a paintbrush, and you can mix different colours to get the exact colour you are looking for. If after one colour you want to apply another one different, you should repeat the masking process again. You can repeat this as many times as you want.\nWhen your prop has the colours you want, it's the most magic moment during all the process: removing the masking tape. While you remove the masking tape carefully, the colours and details of your prop will become visible, and your prop will come to life. At this point, you should apply a layer of transparent varnish to your prop, to avoid it to be damaged in the future.\nAt this point, your prop is finished and you should be very proud of it.

But there's always the world of make-believe, and what better way to get in the ocean vibe than with an amazing deep sea diver costume. I created this costume pattern to try and recreate the feel of the classic \"Mark V\" dive helmet which has become an iconic image of divers and the sea. It was used by the U.S. Navy from 1916 until 1984! Let's make one of our own.\nHere are the tools and materials I used:\nPattern: I used the one that I created. You can find it on my website. It includes an adult and a child size.\n5-8 mm thick EVA foam: I used the foam from an anti-fatigue floor mat, but you can also use the less dense foam from a camping mat.\n2 mm EVA craft foam: One sheet is enough\nVinyl tubing: 3/8\" outside diameter\nWingnut: 1\nSuper Glue\nHot Glue Gun: I love my glue gun because it is adjustable temperature. I like to use it at as low a temp as possible so that the glue cools quickly.\n6 & 8 mm leather punch\nCutting Surface\nGluing Surface: I absolutely love using a silicone baking sheet. Nothing sticks to it.\nSharp Knife: If it is not really sharp you will have a terrible time when you are cutting the foam. I like to use a scalpel.\nBlowdryer: Used for heating the foam so it can be shaped.\nBallpoint Pen\nScissors\nPaint: I used Liquitex Basics \"Mars Black\", Liquitex Basics \"Bronze\" and DecoArt Americana Decor Metallics \u201cVintage Brass\u201d\nRubber Gloves\nPlease note, the above links are affiliate links, and I do get a small commission if you buy through these links.

There are some people that say there isn't enough formamide in EVA mats to be harmful, and others that say there is. Do your research and come to your own conclusions. At the least, I would say it is a good idea to open your foam mat up and let it sit in the sun for a day or two, as most of the chemical will off-gas from the foam. Or buy foam that is labelled formamide free.\nDo not wear your helmet until all fumes from glue and foam are gone. The helmet is a fairly enclosed environment and you only have one set of lungs.\nDo not block off the viewports with glass or plastic. These are open to allow proper airflow for breathing.
