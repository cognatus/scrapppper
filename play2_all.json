[{"category": "Play", "description": "Make your own compressed air hand gun with a few off the shelf parts.\nOver the years I've used compressed air to launch many projectiles, from paper and straw rocket launchers to acorn, airsoft, and blow dart guns. Using compressed air as a propellant works great and you can really get some distance if you can release the air quickly enough. Using a sprinkler valve is the best way to achieve this as it releases the air instantly. I first saw the idea of a sprinkler valve as an air release mechanism in Make Magazine and thought it was genius.\nThe way the gun works is there is a air pump that is used to fill a air chamber inside the gun. To release the air and propel the airsoft bullet, you push a switch (which acts as the trigger) which releases the air valve and expels the air instantly.\nIn this version I decided to reduce the air chamber which means less pumps are needed to fill the chamber. I did think that maybe this might reduce the power of the gun but it didn't make a difference all at. Now all you need to do is to pump about 6 times on the air pump to fill the chamber and your ready to shoot. I have been talking to people a lot smarter than me on how to make the gun more powerful. One of the suggestions was to reduce the piston size of the air pump which will allow you to increase the PSI. I'll have to explore this in the next build.\nDisclaimer:\nI'm assuming that anyone thinking of making this is a responsible and intelligent human being. This is a serious weapon and could do some real damage so please use it responsibly.\nLets get making", "title": "Extreme Airsoft Hand Gun V2", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Extreme-Air-Soft-Hand-Gun-V2/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Parts:\nPVC Pipe. 25mm = 1 inch so if you are in the US just use 1 inch equivalents.

This time I wanted to conceal the pump within the gun. To do this I had to seal the pump inside the air chamber. The pump is smaller in diameter than the 25mm PVC tube (and too big for 20mm tube) so you have to do some modifications to the tube to ensure the pump forms an air tight seal in the air chamber.\nSteps:\n1. If you put the pump inside the PVC you will see that the top section of the pump is slightly too big to push the pump all the way through. This is a good thing as you will be modifying the tube to allow the pump to slot into the PVC. Cut a piece of tube slighly longer than the pump.\n2. With a dremel (sanding drum attached) remove some of the plastic in the inside of the tube. You only want to go about 10mm deep and remove just enough so the pumps end fits inside the tube\n3. Next to help secure the pump a little better (it's quite loose inside the pipe) I added some 20mm PVC tubing around the pump. With a cutting wheel on the dremel, cut down the middle. Next cut a couple of pieces off the tube and place them around the pump\n4.

This will slip onto the barb (which is 8mm) and then you can put the 8mm piece and barrel into the end of the 9mm piece.\n3.

The result would be a huge inflatable dodecahedron dice where you can get into.\nMy biggest problem was to get the right foil. I finally found thick, transparant PVC at a local store, that is used to put over a table so it can't get stained.\nThe maximum size was dictated by the size of my heat-seal machine. This machine is for closing bags for in the freezer and has a width of 30 cm (12 inch), so that makes the maximum length of the ribs of the dice 2 x 30 cm = 60 cm (24 inch).\nThis gave me an inflated object of approximately 140 cm.", "title": "Life-size Hamster Ball Dodecahedron", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Life-size-Hamster-Ball-Dodecahedron/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Materials:\nthick PVC table protector foil\nvinyl sticker material\nsome kind of tube or hose\nbig piece of paper or cardboard\nTools:\na machine to heat-seal plastic\nscissors\nruler (or piece of wood or something)\ntape measure\nmarker (sharpy)\nclothes pins or something like that\na vinyl cutter or somewhere where you can use one\na (air matras) pump", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FR7/1BQY/IYYT6DFM/FR71BQYIYYT6DFM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMJ/PAXB/IYYT6DG4/FMJPAXBIYYT6DG4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJN/AXGL/IYYT6DGM/FJNAXGLIYYT6DGM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTQ/447X/IYYT6DJU/FTQ447XIYYT6DJU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: You Will Need"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The dodecahedron was a good design for the heat-sealer I have, even if I would have wanted to make just a ball.\nThis form makes a big ball with relatively short ribs.\nDraw a pentagon on a piece of paper with a maximum rib length of twice the length of your heat-sealer.\nDon't ask me how to draw a pentagon, because I had a lot of trouble with that.

It's easy, just click the \"Vote!\" banner button to the right of the title on this page, and select the vote button next to the category.\nI used Fusion 360 for the modeling and tool path creation, then cut them on my Shapeoko 3. Getting the depth right took a few tries, but now I have things really dialed in. I can now cut 20 bodies out of a single 12 by 12 inch sheet of acrylic, but initially I was only able to get about 10.\nAs you can see, for the counter weights I used pennies because they look cool and are cheaper than bearings.\nI like the acrylic material because it is strong, and has a shiny finish, and even though it takes about 5 hours to cut a full sheet, the finished product is really nice. The main drawback is they can chip when dropped on a hard surface.\nInitially I 3D printed the bearing caps that prevent your fingers from touching and slowing down the bearing on my FlashForge Creator Pro, but the quality wasn't as good as I would like so I bought more acrylic and used the Shapeoko to cut them out which turned out much better.\nTools Used:\nShapeoko 3 - Any CNC Mill will work\nFlashForge Creator Pro - Discontinued use and now make the bearing caps on the CNC\nFusion 360 software for creating the models (You can just use the file I uploaded)\nMatterControl\nRubber Mallet\nNut driver to secure pennies (you could also use a small piece of wooden dowel the right size)\nMaterials needed:\nAcrylic 1/4 inch thick, 12 x 12 inches\n608 ABEC-9 Skateboard bearings\nDouble sided tape (I use: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LT9K06Y/ref=o...)\nSuper glue (I use: https://www.amazon.com/Stuff-Thin-Instant-Glue-HS...)\nDish washer soap (to get the grease out of the bearings)\nDegreaser (to get the grease out of the bearings)\nSpeed Cream oil (I use: https://www.amazon.com/Bones-Speed-Cream-Bearing-...)\nNew Pennies - Note: This use does not constitute defacing money and is legal because no changes are made to the pennies.", "title": "Fidget Spinner From Acrylic", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Fidget-Spinners-From-Acrylic-on-a-CNC/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I modeled the bodies of the spinners using fusion 360 with the idea that I wanted to make a ascetically good looking, sturdy; but not too bulky design. The triangular design let me puzzle the bodies together and let me maximize the amount of spinner bodies I could get out of a 1'x1' sheet of acrylic.\nI tape the material down to the wasteboard using double sided tape I bought on Amazon. It works great for everything I have tried but gums up the bit a little, not enough to cause cutting problems though. Sometimes it gets rubbed on the outside of the cut and needs to be cleaned off with a towel or microfiber cloth though.\nI used a fairly large .25\" end-mill so it would be able to move greater amounts of material in the pockets in a shorter period of time. This was especially helpful due to the fact that acrylic is extremely tough to cut with a CNC mill (I have not cut aluminum yet but I expect this will experience will help). I had to whittle away at the material .015\" depth at a time at 20 inches per minute because when I tried to go any deeper, the machine's Z-axis belt would skip and ruin the cut. Cutting over the material again shaves enough off the center hole and pockets so that the bearings and pennies don't fit snugly and need to be glued.

I also got some older ones to go under the brand new pennies. you'll want the older pennies to be within about ten years to keep proper weight and balance (the newer ones weigh about 2 grams while the older ones weigh about 3).\nAfter you have your pennies ready, set the older ones in by hand, then use something with a flat head that you can hit with the mallet to push them the rest of the way down into the pocket. I used a nut driver and rubber mallet, but a piece of dowel would work good as well. A light tap will do, hitting it too hard could crack the plastic! After the old pennies are in on the bottom layer you should be able to push the new top pennies in by hand, I pointed the tip of the shield towards the middle to make it symmetric all around.\nTo make sure the pennies wont fall out when someone drops it, I slammed it (not too hard!!) on a piece of cardboard. If no pennies fall out after 2-3 tries the they are secure, but if a couple do fall out then you can put a drop of superglue on the bottom penny, be careful only to use a little drop. I have glued my finger to many spinners and sanding it off is a pain, and ruins the shiny finish.\nIf you want, you can sand the whole thing with a fine grit sand paper like 1500 or 1100 to give it a nice matte finish as long as you do it in random patterns.\nAfter gluing, pop a clean bearing in an make sure it spins well, then put the caps on. Sometimes they need a little help since they are a snug fit for the bearings we purchased. If the bearing is too loose you can just take a small strip of scotch tape and put it around one side of the bearing and it should fit properly after that.

The 3 bearing spinners were too big for my hands, so I started designing 4 bearing spinners and this is when I started to use pennies instead of bearings for counterweights because my skateboard no longer had any bearings left to use, and I needed more.\nCutting Acrylic was another challenge, as I mentioned before. Initially the travel speed and RPM of the router melted the acrylic and caused it to gum up the bit, but with some research I got the steps and found that the lowest 10k RPM speed works great. It also had problems with the Z axis stalling out and not going deep enough until I changed the depth to .015 of an inch. The toolpath is setup in the files that are attached have a good speed and depth per cut. It takes about 5 hours to cut a full one, but I have been through multiple sheets with no errors.\nIn my first runs I didn't get the depth right and had some problems with that, but having a flat bed, and getting the bit have a piece of paper pass under it got it dialed in just right.

It's time to step up your gaming.\nContinuing from the last Instructable where we made a gaming table, we're now going to make some terrain tiles to match! Continuing the spirit of keeping it modular, we're going to make a variety of tiles that can work together in many many configurations. Since our gaming table is 6 ft x 4 ft, we're going to make our tiles 2 ft x 2 ft. This allows you to use them with a variety of table sizes (4x4, 6x4, 8x4...)\nIn this Instructable, we're going to cover four main ideas of making terrain. We'll make mountains, craters, give texture to the surface, and the paint everything. We'll be using 1 in thick blue foam, which you can find at the hardware store. I found big sheets that were 2 ft x 8 ft, and was able to get the store to cut 2 ft x 2 ft squares for me. Check that they are actually 2 ft x 2 ft, even a slight amount (1/8 in) too big can make them fit too tightly into your table. Once I had the foam as my base, I was ready to go.\nLets get started!", "title": "Modular Tabletop Terrain Boards", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Modular-Tabletop-Terrain-Boards/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Planning\nWe'll start with the biggest mountains. The idea here is to create four tiles that can be rearranged to give you different mountain configurations. In order for this to work smoothly, you need to measure where the corners of each mountain ledge will end, so they line up no matter how you arrange them. For my mountains, I wanted them to cover a quarter of the tile, so they started at 12 in. I then decided how big I wanted the top layer to be, which was 12 in diameter (compared to the 24 in bottom layer). That means that each side has to be 6 in. Then, the middle row of the mountain was 9 in, to make sure that the steps were even. If you want to make a taller mountain, you can add more layers!\nCutting\nIt's easiest to cut the mountain corners out of a corner of foam, to ensure that you have a good 90 degree edge. This means you may have to buy a lot of a foam squares, and only use the corners, which can waste the middles. If you want to cut your own corners, I would suggest cutting slightly under 90 degrees, rather than slightly over. We can fill in the gaps later.\nOnce you have your marks on the edges (6 in, 9 in, 12in) hold your knife vertically and cut a jagged shape across to create a rough outline for your rocks. Cut in a rough quarter circle shape, the exact shapes and positions don't matter, the only thing that matters is that the edges line up with your measured marks.\nMatching\nWhen all your pieces are cut, line up the pieces to make a trio of bottom, middle, and top. Depending how you cut the edges, some pieces may look better together than others. I marked my layers with 1, 1A, 1B, 1C, 2, 2A, 2B... so that I knew which tiles (1) matched to each layer (ABC). Once you start pairing the pieces up, you can make adjustment cuts on the jagged edges so that the layers look good together. The thing I focused on was ensuring that the mountain layers were wide enough for big models to sit on.\nWith these layers done, it's time to add details! Next we will add a rockier texture.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F4E/1F3L/IZQA5IVE/F4E1F3LIZQA5IVE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQP/3RJJ/IZQA5IVJ/FQP3RJJIZQA5IVJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9R/GFRL/IZQA5IVH/F9RGFRLIZQA5IVH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKL/Q75G/IZQA5IVK/FKLQ75GIZQA5IVK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Plan Out the 4 Mountains"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The mountains are roughly shaped, now we will add some rock texture to make them even better! Here you have two choices. You can either use a gap filler, and make smooth mountains, or you can carve in rock textures and keep the edges as a stepped appearance. I know that a smooth mountain is more realistic, but a smooth mountain is very annoying to balance models on. If you want to make smooth mountains, we will cover how to in the \"Sealing Gaps\" step (step 6).\nRock Texture\nTo carve a rock texture, you need to cut angles on the edges of the foam. Make sure to cut on the top and bottom of the foam. Cut at a variety of angles and depths to make the rocks looks more realistic (Picture #2). Take care when cutting the corners, the rocks need to blend into the other mountain pieces. Since you're going to be rearranging the mountains, don't try to make a perfect blend between corners, just ensure that they look decent together. Picture #3 shows how much of a difference carving the rock texture in makes!\nOnce all your mountain layers are carved, set them aside for texturing and painting. I glued mine together, and that made it more difficult to paint. You can use toothpicks to hold them together for texturing, which will allow you to see how the final product will look.\nSingle Mountain\nOnce you've made a few layers of mountains, you can make a different mountain to sit on a single tile, rather then a mountain that crosses multiple tiles (Picture #4). Follow the same steps as you did to make the mountain layers, except this time you don't have a 90 degree corner to deal with. You can also cut a standing rock shape to put on the top of the mountain, or to scatter around the tiles! To make the standing rock, cut a rough shape out of foam and cut rock texture in.\nNext we will cover how to carve some craters!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZM/2YYD/IZQA5IVL/FZM2YYDIZQA5IVL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F29/X5XQ/IZQA5IVP/F29X5XQIZQA5IVP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2L/Z0ZS/IZQA5IVR/F2LZ0ZSIZQA5IVR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOK/E326/IZQA5IW9/FOKE326IZQA5IW9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Carve Rock Texture"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Craters are good to add different heights to your board. We're going to make two types of craters. One to sit above your tile, and one to dig into it. Making both are very similar.\nShaping\nTo make a crater, start by cutting out a rough circle on an angle (Picture #1). Don't cut too deep, or you'll pierce through the bottom of the foam! Next, cut a cross hatch pattern of approx 1/2 in to loosen the foam (Picture #2). Now, you can either use a spoon to scoop the foam out, or continue with a knife. This is a very messy process, the foam bits will fly all over the place. Use the tool to shape the crater how you want, then smooth the surface with sand paper or scotch brite (Pictures #3-5). You can also put some texture in the bottom of the crater using sand. See Step #5 for how to add texture.\nRock Texture\nOnce you have a crater scooped out, you can add rock texture around it the same way you did on the mountains. With an above ground crater, its easy, just cut a jagged shape around the crater (Picture #5), then carve the rock texture in (Picture #6). For a crater in the ground, I cut lots of small rocks out of spare foam pieces and glued them all over (Picture #8). This was a pain to paint, so I don't recommend it.\nIf you accidentally scrape too deep, and break through the bottom of the foam, no worries! On the above ground crater, you can ignore it if you are gluing it to a terrain tile. If you are leaving it free to place in different places around the board, you can put a thin piece of plastic card or card board to fill the hole. Or, if you got a hole in your terrain tile, you can use hot glue to fill in the hole. Once its all painted, you won't be able to tell where the gap is.\nCraters are quick to make, you can carve an above ground crater in ~10 min. Inside a tile is a bit harder, and also depends how big you make it.\nNow that we have all our mountains and craters, we can add more textures.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2B/78V2/J0X4X3EN/F2B78V2J0X4X3EN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCF/TEU9/J0X4X3EO/FCFTEU9J0X4X3EO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7V/ZRYT/J0X4X3EP/F7VZRYTJ0X4X3EP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEV/MRQO/J0X4X3EK/FEVMRQOJ0X4X3EK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP5/MEHO/J0X4X3EL/FP5MEHOJ0X4X3EL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTU/ALXI/J0X4X3EM/FTUALXIJ0X4X3EM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMC/TD0F/IZQA5IW6/FMCTD0FIZQA5IW6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F01/RPSV/IZQA5IW2/F01RPSVIZQA5IW2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Carve Craters"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "To texture your pieces, we're going to use a mix of white craft glue and water. This is a very similar process to adding sand to your miniatures bases, just at a larger scale. Mix the glue and water at a ratio of roughly 80:20 (glue:water). The water helps the glue flow around the tile better, and also makes it easier to apply with a paint brush. Careful though, if you use too much water it weakens the glue and the sand will fall off. Mix the glue in small amounts with a few drops of water at a time in a small plastic container.\nSand Choice\nFor sand, I found some pouches of decorative sand at the dollar store. You can use outdoor sand as well, ensure that it is completely dry before you use it. If you're using outdoor sand, you should sift it to ensure the pieces are the correct sizes (you don't want big chunks throwing off the scale of your board!). I would advise against using bigger pieces (like small rocks), as it makes painting the boards more difficult. I tried to use small aquarium rocks from the pet store blended in with the sand, but most of them fell off while painting (or got stuck in the roller and scratched the surface...).\nTexturing\nOnce you have your sand and glue mixture ready, use an old paintbrush to draw shapes on your foam. Try to avoid painting shapes near the edge of the tiles, it will look funny unless the tile beside it matches the shape. Since the tiles are always going to be moving, you can't count on that!\nYou can paint on a full tiles worth of glue, and then sprinkle sand onto the tile. Work on one tile at a time, otherwise the glue will dry before you get the sand on! You can sprinkle more or less in various places to get different textures. Once you've covered the tile, tip it over to get all the loose sand off to use for the next tile! When all the pieces are textured, you're ready for painting.\nFlat Tiles\nWhile you're texturing, you can make some plain terrain tiles (no mountains or craters). These are good so that you have space to put different pieces of terrain on. They are very quick too make, just paint texture on a 2 ft x 2 ft tile.\nBefore we get to painting, we're going to cover how to seal any gaps that may be left.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZR/SJ89/J0X4X7LG/FZRSJ89J0X4X7LG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZB/KSQS/IZQA5IWA/FZBKSQSIZQA5IWA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0X/J12Q/IZQA5IWI/F0XJ12QIZQA5IWI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Add Texture"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "In this step we're going to work on sealing gaps in the foam. The main gaps I had to seal were the corners of the mountains, since the pieces of foam were not exactly 90 degrees. I used drywall filler, with multiple coats. If you try to do one thick coat, the filler will take ages to dry, or the center may never dry and leave a soggy core. Check the filler you use to see the maximum thickness it recommends applying per layer.\nTools\nTo spread the filler, I first tried a plastic lid cut in half, and was scooping the filler with an old toothbrush. However, I found that a corner of foam works much better (Picture #3 and #4). Who needs fancy tools!\nApplication\nScoop the filler out, and spread it along the corners of the mountains (Picture #5). If you're doing multiple coats, ensure the previous coats have dried solid before starting the next. You can use the foam to make a smooth surface, or wait until the final coat is done and sand it flat.\nSmooth Mountains\nIf you would like to smooth out your mountains, rather than leaving them as steps, I would recommend putting in a different material first, rather than trying to use pure drywall filler. You can cut foam to fit in the corners of the mountains, and then put filler over top to make a smooth curve. If you try to smooth it with pure filler, then you will have to do many many layers to ensure that you're not leaving too much to dry at once.\nYou can also use drywall filler to smooth out any other gaps or surfaces on your other terrain pieces.

Sometimes the melted, bubbly look of the dissolved foam can be an awesome texture.\nBase Coating\nIf you want to protect your foam from spray paint, you can do a base coat with latex paint. This will allow the spray paint to sit on top of the latex, and not react with the foam. You can also use acrylic paints from the craft store (or dollar store). If you've been leaving all your foam pieces separate, it is fastest to base coat everything with a roller (Picture #1). This way it only takes a few min per tile. Once you've rolled everything you can, use a brush to touch up the last areas (Picture #3). Don't forget to paint the edges of the tiles too! I left painting the edges till the very end, that's why most of the pictures have blue edges (Picture #4). Painting the edges is easy if you do 2 at a time, and leave it to dry. This allows you to rotate the tiles without fear of getting wet paint on the floor. You can use newspaper to make a clear area for painting, I also used a big sheet of MDF from the gaming table to protect the floor.\nDry Brushing\nOnce everything is base coated, you can begin the detail work. Dry brushing is the fastest way to make the terrain pop, it really takes advantage of the textures that you've put down. Another option is to lightly dust colours on with spray paint. I wanted my terrain to look ashey, so I went with a black base coat, a grey dry brush, followed by a white dry brush.\nTo dry bush, get a small amount of paint on your brush. Wipe the brush on a paper towel, to press the paint into the bristles, as well as wiping most of the paint off. When there is a small amount of paint left on the brush, lightly paint over your textured areas. The small amount of paint on the brush will catch on the raised areas, leaving the lower levels untouched. This is a fast way to get highlighting done. Pro Tip: Dry brush in a circular motion, if you do a linear motion (up down side to side) it looks really obvious and leaves streak marks. Circular moves looks more natural.\nOnce your grey is complete, you're ready to dry brush the next layer (Picture #5)! Don't dry brush the entire textured parts, leave some parts grey so you have a variety of colours (or in this case, shades) showing. This makes it looks a bit more realistic. Picture #6 shows the slight difference between a grey dry brush and a white dry brush.\nYou should dry brush the edges of the rock texture as well. Use the same technique, and focus on the edges and corners so it looks like the rocks are lighter where light hits them. Use the white dry brush a bit heavier on the very corners to make it really pop.\nFinal Assembly\nIt's easiest to leave your mountains and craters separate to make painting easier. Now that painting is done, you can glue everything to your tiles using the same white craft glue. You should also use some pins to hold everything together. The pins can be toothpicks, or paperclips cut short and straightened. Once your pins are in, spread lots of white glue around the bottom of your mountains (get right to the edges!) and press them to the top of the tile. Put some weight on top to hold it together while it dries. You can also put some dots of hot glue in as well to hold it in place for the white glue to dry.\nNow you're done!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FW5/TDRI/IZQA5IWD/FW5TDRIIZQA5IWD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLL/S0IH/IZQA5IWH/FLLS0IHIZQA5IWH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTL/JTJV/IZQA5IWM/FTLJTJVIZQA5IWM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZF/VY2J/J08EHZSM/FZFVY2JJ08EHZSM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVY/ATPL/IZQA5IWN/FVYATPLIZQA5IWN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F20/Y8SW/IZQA5IXD/F20Y8SWIZQA5IXD.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Painting"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "In this Instructable we learned to make terrain tiles that can be pieced together in many different ways to create a variety of battlefields for your war games!

His puzzle was extremely simple - a popsicle stick with a loop of twine attached on one end. He looped the puzzle to a buttonhole on my jacket. It looked SO simple to me; but after 5 minutes I was ready to grab a pair of scissors. I eventually figured out how to get the thing off my jacket. Needless to say, I felt pretty dumb for taking so long.\nI built a few of my own and have tried them on multiple people (my hapless family.) The solution is not intuitive and my solution time wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought\u2026I AM trying to make myself feel better. Anyway, the puzzle can be made more challenging by placement.

They're also generally made of a bendy, durable kind of plastic that can be easily shaped with ordinary woodworking tools.\nRegarding dimensions, I've found that for medium sized hands a spinner of 80 mm in length works well (third picture).

I also drilled (third picture) guide holes of 2 mm in the centre of the circles for the bearing and nuts, for when the spade bit is used later on. You can use a punch (fourth picture) to help drill the guide holes accurately.\nBefore gluing the two halves together, I roughened the inside faces with sandpaper for the glue to stick to. I also drilled four 5 mm holes opposite each other halfway through each half (sixth picture), hoping they'd form a kind of concealed rivet when filled with glue to help keep the bond intact.\nIn the third picture from the right the bonded piece of plastic can be seen.

The light grey connectors should also be kept straight, so they can assist in the lifting of the balls of the machine.\nAfter inserting the jigsaw, you'll link up the top and bottom crank with a driveshaft. You can use other methods to link up these two cranks, such as a geartrain or chain (an example of the geartrain method is in the last picture). I just like the drivehaft method since there's less friction and it's easy to extend. If you're making your lift taller, be sure to connect more than the top and bottom cranks to the driveshaft (you'll probably want to connect to the driveshaft every 2 red rods). As stated in the first step, you can use only red gears if you don't have any yellow ones. Go to picture 20 for how to use red gears only.\nImportant: After building the linkage of your choice, you'll have to adjust the cranks that are linked up. To do this, slowly turn the jigsaw from the bottom crank by hand (turn it in the direction that it will be moving when finished, not backwards), and make sure the jigsaw runs smoothly all the way around. You especially want to watch out for when the jigsaw reaches its highest point and starts lowering.

It can give distance traveled and the time duration of the exercise session. (See the small numbers across the bottom of the Schwinn display. According to the reading, I have been exercising for 2 minutes and 56 seconds at the time this photo was taken. (This monitor does display both time and speed. An official NordicTrack montior like the one shown in the Introduction shows only one or the other at any one time.) The time duration of the last workout session is held in memory and should be deleted before the start of a new session. See the Schwinn instruction sheet linked in the last step on how to bring up the duration of the workout and how to zero out the reading from the previous session.)\nAs regards pulse, there are work-arounds. First, the heart rate tool for a NordicTrack monitor involves a spring clip on the user's ear lobe. I have tried one, and it was not very accurate. In addition, I believe the user is supposed to stop exercising for part of a minute while the monitor acquires a reading.\nThe dependable low-tech. way is to release the cords from your hands for a few moments, put a finger or two on the big vein in your neck and count your heartbeats for 10 seconds. Then multiply by six for beats per minute. Nurses check pulses all of the time with fingers on a pulse point and a 10 second count. The time display on the Schwinn cyclometer reads out continuous seconds, but you will need to keep your feet moving on the NordicTrack skis or the display will freeze after about 5 seconds.\nMany people wear an electronic fitness tracker on their wrist, and these often include a heart rate monitor. The method of reading your heart rate employed is to turn a bright LED \"on\" and a camera lens reads fluctuations in translucence of the blood flow under your skin associated with surges of blood from a heartbeat. Most of these fitness trackers do not give a continuous readout because the bright LED light would deplete the battery very quickly. Some take a reading at intervals, and uploading data to the companion app. would show a graph for your pulse during the duration of your workout. Customer reviews on various trackers both praise and condemn the same model on accuracy, no matter whose brand name is on it. Some customers complain that their tracker quit working after only a few months.\nI found Instant Heart Rate by Argus with Azumio in the App. Store and have it on my smart phone. It is free and uses the same LED technology characteristic of the now popular fitness trackers worn on the wrist. It gives a quite accurate count. See the second photo. It shows a collage of a phone mount I made. It helps me to avoid dropping my smart phone while using the heart rate app. Lightly place your index finger over your phone's light and camera lens. The reading requires ten or fifteen seconds before it is complete and is a snapshot, not a continuous reading. It is fairly easy to hold an index finger over the phone's camera while exercising without too much bouncing around. After a few readings with any of the above methods you will know what your breathing is like in your target heart rate zone and can use it as a general guide. Check again periodically. As your condition improves, your processing of oxygen becomes more efficient and the correlation between breathing and heart rate can shift.\nThe most reliable heart rate monitors involve a sensor on a chest strap. The sensor sends data to a receiver wirelessly. The readout is usually continuous. Some fitness trackers offer a chest strap as an add-on.\nAt the very best, calories burned per hour as reported by the NordicTrack computer is only a reasonable guess. The amount of effort expended is also a factor. At this site, you find this information: The Nordic Track ski machine can help you to burn calories and get in shape. According to Calorie Lab, a 150-pound person on a Nordic Track Ski Machine will burn 415 calories per hour for light effort, 496 calories per hour for moderate effort and 571 calories per hour for hard effort. If you weigh more, calorie expenditure will be somewhat greater. If you seek out more information like this, you may not find information related to a ski machine, but try searching for cross-country skiing. This site has a calculator into which you enter personal data, and it gives you a calorie count per hour. Fitness trackers worn on the wrist use your heart rate to calculate calories burned based on personal data you enter in the corresponding app. on your phone..\nIf you are familiar with Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper's aerobics program, you can get a table of exercise point values for cross-country skiing here. (Scroll to page 18 of 21.) A reasonably fit person gets a minimum of 30 points per week. 20 minutes of cross-country skiing is worth 6 points. 30 minutes is worth 9 points. Some of Cooper's charts will mention a ski machine, but this fairly comprehensive chart does not, so cross-country skiing is the closest applicable category. Unfortunately, this chart also does not distinguish for different levels of effort.\nIf you have a NordicTrack monitor and need to replace it or if you do not have a monitor and want one, you can use newer technology in a recently manufactured device for very little money. One thing I really appreciate about this skier monitor is that its response to speed changes is much quicker than the official NordicTrack monitor. I also find trying to keep my speed within a certain narrow range keeps me focused on the Schwinn monitor so that time passes quickly and I do not have time to become bored.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKS/NCG3/J048CMH0/FKSNCG3J048CMH0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYK/GRHD/J7AQUX89/FYKGRHDJ7AQUX89.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Other Data"}], "channel": "Sports"}, {"category": "Play", "description": "The inspiration for this project was the desire to build a chessboard that could operate both vertically and on a tabletop. My brother enjoys playing correspondence chess, so I thought he'd like a vertical, wall-mounted chessboard so he could play slow games like correspondence chess with me, his roommates, or visitors to his house. Often, though, if we have a game going on when we meet up, he suggests setting up our current layout on a conventional board and playing through. This inspired me to make a vertical board that could easily be converted for tabletop play mid-game.\nTo accomplish this, the board is simply lifted off a wall and laid flat. The pieces fall over, but remain on their spaces. The shelf assembly is removed and placed underneath the board to get it out of the way and give the board a bit of height off the table. Pieces need to be set upright, but other than that, they are in the same places as before and the game can proceed on a table.\nAlthough I'm pleased with the outcome, I have plenty of suggestions for things I'd do differently, which I'll mention as they come up.\nThis took me ~ 30 hours of hands-on work because I didn't know what I was doing. It could probably be done in 20 or less if I were following this guide. I'd rate it as moderate difficulty because pieces need to fit together and it requires some precision for drilling and staining.

I measured with my ruler, marked the wood, and laid the grid out with tape. I applied dark stain and let it absorb, then wiped off the excess with a rag and repeated several times. Once dry, I peeled off the tape and repeated for the squares which were covered by the tape. Once I had my dark squares, I applied a light stain so that the light squares wouldn't look like raw unfinished wood.\nI was surprised by how light the dark stain was. Ultimately, it didn't matter too much. I think it looks alright. Still, this was a lesson in the complexities of staining. The final color depends heavily on how absorbent the wood is and what kind of stains are used. You can apply it heavier, but it will bleed under the tape. You may want to find a different guide for making a great chessboard if you're looking for a professional look. Look up tips, consult reddit.com/r/finishing or use test pieces if you want to get a better result than mine.\nOnce both stains were applied, I covered the whole board -- besides the borders I was going to paint -- in several coats of urethane finish.

This is a guide to all the elements in Citadel, for those who are looking to add elements in their machine and want instructions. Each element has its own step. Most of these elements are pretty small and compact, as I couldn't use any huge elements in such a compact machine. There are also lots of elements that fit well into red rod towers, so you won't have to have blank towers in your machine. If you'd like to see the video that these elements are in, click here for the Citadel video.\nBefore you begin: Some of the pictures used in this guide are from Citadel V2. I built onto Citadel after making the official video so I could make the elements and tracks work more reliably. For more information on Citadel V2, here are some links to pictures/video:\nOverview video\nCitadel V2 Photos\nCitadel V2 Construction\nCitadel Deconstruction\n_______________________________________________\nNote: Throughout this Instructable there are some elements that are more step-by-step than others, as I don't have the time to rebuild all of them. So, I decided to build the more complex ones that require some explanation. You'll also notice that I've put a lot of the picture info in image notes, rather than in a numbered list like I used to. This is so you won't have to leave the full-screen picture mode, read an image's description, and open the next one into full screen. If you're having trouble with a certain element because there aren't enough pictures, leave a comment and I'll rebuild it and make better pictures.\nThese have not been tested with newer Knex balls, since I use the original balls from Big Ball Factory. You'll have to use your own judgement if you use newer balls, which are slightly larger and lighter than the older ones. Also, lots of the elements have cheap support structures that are meant to be improved (go to Step 21 for an example of these cheap supports).\nLet's get building!", "title": "Citadel Knex Ball Machine Elements - Instructions", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Citadel-Knex-Ball-Machine-Elements-Instructions/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Video link\nThis maze is like a horizontal maze and vertical maze combined, as you can curve it however you like.

It's easy to fit into a red rod tower, but make sure it's reinforced so it'll be nice and strong like in the pictures. Also make sure to either include a floor at the bottom or tracks on all sides.

The most difficult part of this element is the top, as you don't want the ball falling out or going to the other helix. If it does go on either helix, you'll need two tracks at the bottom to catch the ball. I got mine to work on just one helix so mine only has one exit track.

It uses 2 chains as well, and the ball transfers from one chain to the other as it descends. The chains are hooked up to a small escapement mechanism, which makes the chains not go down too fast, while still allowing the ball to easily go down. The tricky part of this element is making sure the chains don't go to the side and get stuck. I added some guardrails along some parts to prevent this, as seen in the last two pictures. I wouldn't advise making it taller, as that will just allow the chain to be more loose. If yours still doesn't work with guardrails, make it shorter.\nImportant: If you make yours a different height than the one in these instructions, the spacing of the red connectors on the chain may be different.

It's one of my favorite games, and since the theme of catwalks and factory was inspired from Portal 2, I decided I wanted some portals in there as well. It may come of surprise, but the pieces aren't actually made of moon rock. A second ball waits behind a wall, and when the first ball activates a small arm it releases this second ball at the right time to make it look like a real portal. You'll have to cut tubing if you want the orange and blue portals, but it looks cool and like the real thing. I made my portals where they are so you can't see what's behind them as easily, like the tracks leading into the back where the second ball is stored. I recommend making a wall so you can't see the second ball.\nThe version covered in these instructions has the same spacing as the one in Citadel.

Standard ball collectors release the balls at the same time, but this one adds a timed release once they're collected. The balls pile up behind a gate, and when the last ball comes in it goes past the waiting line, using an overflow track much like the ones at the bottom of the machine. It then ends up activating the release gate, which sends the rest of the balls into the exit. This gate is a double gate, much like the one that's motorized before the 4-way path separator for the lower side of the machine. The timing depends on how long you make the track that connects the release gate to the arm. You can make it collect as many balls as you want, and you can also modify the timing by changing the length of the connecting track.\nI built two versions in Citadel, one before the vortex that collects 5 balls and one before the yellow zigzag to collect 4 balls. These work best if the last ball is coming in straight on. The smaller one I built had to be more compact, so the balls came in from the side, and sometimes the last ball didn't go into the overflow track. That's why I recommend making the version where the ball comes in straight on from the back (this version worked 100% for me).

To get the best results, you need to have the grenade bounce up into the air one way or another. If you throw it against a wall it will begin spinning but get interrupted by the second impact when it hits the ground a second or two later. It will still throw out decent coverage. But for best results it should be thrown up high so when it comes down, it bounces back up allowing it to spin and empty all of it's paint while in mid air. I use these mainly for room clearing in paintball games.\nFor example, you and an enemy are in adjacent rooms in a building. Neither of you wanting to go through the door first so it turns into a stalemate where you both just sit tight watching the door for the other. That's where these grenades have been crazy effective. If you have a teammate with you, have them cover the door so you can lower your gun and pull out a grenade. Press down on the PVC cap and pull the pin out. Then throw grenade around the corner at a downward angle (imagine an NFL player spiking the football after a touchdown) into the room. This will cause the grenade to bounce back up high enough to dump all of the paint 360 degrees into the room and take out anyone in there.\nAnother example is to lob it high so it comes down behind a bunker in the woods and bounces that way as well. If you throw it like a baseball it will be less effective when it bounces off a wall or tree and gets interrupted by the secondary impact while it's still trying to spin.\nMessage me if you have any questions.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 6: Testing"}], "channel": "Paintball"}, {"category": "Play", "description": "Hi All,\nI wanted to introduce liquid density concept for my son and have fun\nI am going to share how to build Ocean in a bottle and Oil Timer, using everyday items, found at home\nKids can do this by themselves with little Adult supervision and have fun", "title": "Fun With Liquids for Kids", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Fun-With-Liquids-for-Kids/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Material Needed\n2 Plastic bottles ( small sized, cola bottles)\n1 Straw or thin pipe\nSuper glue\nWater ( Distilled water prefered )\nBlue Water color\nVegetable oil\nHow to make ?\nSuper glue two bottle caps and puncture/drill holes large enough for the pipe to pass\nThe pipes must fit tight, if you feel they are loose use can use super glue to hold them\nThe pipe height is adjusted as per the image ( It should not be at same height, keep 0.5 inch gap)\nAdd water to one of the bottles and add (water based) blue color in it, till you are happy with the shade\nClose the cap while applying super glue\nFIll Oil into another bottle, till the rim edge\nNow with a swift action invert the bottle with water and close the cap\nVideo\nLink may not work on app", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXU/GDUL/IYOQMPBS/FXUGDULIYOQMPBS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3S/KGF6/IYOQMPCR/F3SKGF6IYOQMPCR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYF/T2J6/IYOQMPDP/FYFT2J6IYOQMPDP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F13/6NER/IYOQMPEN/F136NERIYOQMPEN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Oil Timer"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Material Needed\n1 Plastic bottles\nSuper glue\nWater ( Distilled water prefered )\nBlue Water color\nVegetable oil\nHow to make ?\nAdd water to the bottle ( half filled)\nAdd blue color till you are happy with shade\nAdd Oil till the rim edge, removing as much as air\nSuper glue the bottle cap to the bottle while closing\nVideo\nLink may not work on app", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F76/7M1B/IYOQMPFN/F767M1BIYOQMPFN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5P/2ISF/IYOQMPFQ/F5P2ISFIYOQMPFQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBM/J7EF/IYOQMPGQ/FBMJ7EFIYOQMPGQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9T/6SYX/IYOQMPGT/F9T6SYXIYOQMPGT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA6/GNR6/IYOQMPHS/FA6GNR6IYOQMPHS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Ocean in a Bottle"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I noticed after a day playing with them, the clarity in the oil went bad.

There is an official kit, with standard wood block (that can be modified according to the Scout\u2019s vision), and plastic wheels with metal axles. The popularity of this event amongst youth has led to the development of a small industry supplying various and necessary components, such as race timers.\nThis Instructable describes a simple race timer based on an Arduino Uno. There are commercial devices that are more richly featured, but this Instructable is for a Cub Pack that may not have the funds for a premium solution. As various tracks differ greatly, it concentrates on the software and basic interface. This example is for three tracks; as long as you have two pins available for each additional lane, you can add lanes. The same software can work with an Arduino Mega and with that model, you could have more lanes than you can deal with. The Instructable does NOT cover construction on the track.\nA gantry over the finish line holds one IR LED for each lane. In the lane center piece (which is used as a guide for the cars), the detector, which has been mounted in a tube, is glued into a hole. When a car crosses the finish line, it breaks the beam and the Arduino records the event. It displays the results by blinking white LEDS in a pattern over each lane. One blink, first place. Two blinks, second place.

The cards rank as follows: A (high), K, Q, J, 10 (low).\nOverview of earning points\nThere are two ways to earn points each round:\nScoring melds (This is done after the bidding phase and before tricks)\nScoring tricks (This is done after all the tricks are played)\nOverview of a round\nEach round has the following general pattern:\n20 cards are dealt to each player\nEach team bids on how many points they think they can win during this round.\nThe winner of the bid chooses a suit to be the trump suit\nTeams score points based on the different melds (special combinations of cards) that they have in their hands\nThe players play and win tricks (sets of four cards)\nThe teams score points based on the cards in the tricks that they won.\nSetup\nPinochle is a card game played with four people on two teams.

Scoring is by team, not by individual player.\nIt\u2019s okay to reuse a card in different melds of different types. For example, a card can be used in a Royal Marriage and a Pinochle, because those melds are different types. However, a card cannot be reused for two melds of the same type.\nYou do not need to show cards that don't score you points during the meld\nThe table above gives different score values for the melds, depending on how many of that meld you have in your hand.

This would score a total of 30 points for the two melds.\nCount each player\u2019s meld scores individually, but then add together partners\u2019 scores.

(Photographs 1 to 6)\nWith the fourth you have selected to construct SS-3, fold the paper in half along its length and width to divide it\ninto fourths. Cut along the length-wise center crease. Keep the remaining paper below--this will become SS-4 in the next step. (Photographs 7 to 14)\nWith this new and smaller piece, again fold the paper up in half along its length center crease and pull the length sides' edges into the center crease to create new fourth folds. (Photographs 15 to 18)\nFold the length edges of the paper into the center again to make eighth folds. After you have done this, fold the eighths over top of one another. (Photographs 19 to 22)\nAccentuate the width center crease with your pencil; with the open edge facing toward the maker constructing the piece and identify side as SS-3L and the right as SS-3R. With this done, cut along the width half fold to bisect the paper. (Photographs 23 to 25)\nOn SS-3L, measure 1.125 inches from the inboard half mark you just cut previously. On SS-3R, measure 1.125 inches from the inboard half mark you just cut previously.

Try an keep power distributed fairly evenly, and bring pieces over to add strength if you see an attack coming.\n\nWhen attacking, it's a bad idea to let any of your pieces become cut off from your main force.

Have you ever seen a baseball pitching machine or tennis ball launcher? No? What about the mechanism inside one of those battery powered Nerf guns? No? Okay...\nThe launcher uses two wheels with grippy rubber tyres, both spinning very fast in opposite directions. The left one spins anticlockwise, and the right one spins clockwise.

It's not too difficult to build, no motors are needed and works about 90% of the time when instructions are carefully followed.\nYou can check out step 1 for the special pieces that you'll need to build this separator. Also 11 Medium yellow (or grey) and 7 small bleu (or brown) gears are needed. If you don't have 11 Med yellow gears, don't worry, you can replace the 7 Med gears in step 9 and 10 with the Med red gears instead.\nIn step 19 you'll see that a little table needs to be made and fixed underneath the separator. This table puts the separator at an angle of 12 degrees, which is very important! So if you want to use this separator in one of your machines, make sure it stands at an angle of 12 degrees.\nYou can always watch the video to see how it works.\nIf there are any complains, problems

We push the lab tables together (end to end) to make a series of long tables. We set up three cups at the end of the table filled with sand. Students work in pairs to either hit the cups (one point) or sink the marble into the cups (3 points). First to 10 wins, but they have to win by 2.

Possible variables include but are not limited to:\nthe distance the throwing arm gets pulled back in cm.\nthe number of rubber bands\nthe mass of the projectile\nthe angle the throwing arm gets pulled back\nthe angle of the throwing arm at it's stopping point\nthe size of the basket\nEvidence: Students then design an experiment to test their claim. They collect data and create a data table.\nReasoning: Students are then expected to be able to use the evidence they collected to support their claim. For example: To launch a catapult 300 cm, students must be aware of the distance the throwing arm gets pulled back in centimeters and the number of rubber bands. First, our team used a metric ruler to mark centimeters 1-6 on the \"A\" frame of our catapult. Next, we collected 4 rubber bands. To keep the mass of the projectile the same, we used the same marble with a mass of 4.5 grams for the entire experiment. According to our data, using 3 rubber bands and pulling the throwing arm back a distance of 4 cm resulted in a throwing distance of 300 cm. Our next closest trial was using 2 rubber bands and pulling the throwing arm back 6 cm because the marble landed 315 cm away.

It is by far the most complex and difficult build for me yet both structurally and ascetically. I used the high quality model version of the banshee seen in the cinematics for the game rather than the in game unit model which when you look at the pictures(at the end above) you will see there is a large difference between the 2, so I went with the more geometric and higher resolution version for this build. All of the reference pictures I used to make this are above, I used nothing else(I couldn't find anything else).\n\nIn this project I pushed the limits of K'nex pieces many times to get angles and shapes that the standard K'nex angles (45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315, 360 degrees) don't support. The biggest challenge for me (structurally wise) in this project was how to get the main body to support the very large twin turbofans without breaking or sagging. One idea I considered was using gears to raise and lower the turbofan arms like it does in game ( as I could in this build but did not have enough pieces in the right color or certain pieces only had a few select colors.

It's very important that the camera's operating voltage is starting at 3.6 Volt as toy quadcopters are usually powered by a single 3.7V lipo battery. You can find cameras for around 20 USD here or here.\nLast but not least you will need a FPV monitor or FPV goggles to receive the transmitted video signal. There are lot of good options out there, you can check out banggood or gearbest.\nBesides, you will need\na soldering iron and tin,\na Phillips screw driver\nand double sided duct tape.\nHave fun!", "title": "How to Convert a Toy Quadcopter Into a FPV Racer", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Convert-a-Toy-Quadcopter-Into-a-FPV-Racer/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "First, you have to remove the lower chassis:\nRemove all the screws on the bottom of the chassis.

We can easily do this by capping the internal wall with a piece of aluminum foil - make sure the foil goes slightly over the edges to trap heat - and heating it with a candle's flame.\nI found it was easy to use 3 fire bricks and arrange them as shown, with a tea light in the slot between them.

It advises you to follow your heart and intuition if you are to take a leap toward achieving a goal. In practical terms, The Lovers can also reveal outgrowing an environment, such as a young person leaving home and taking a step toward independence. (Dean, 2008, 20)\nReversed Meaning\nBreak-ups and commitment issues: one person may pull away from a relationship rather than work through difficulties. Tension mounts as imbalance and temptation creep in, such as seeking out an affair as a way of avoiding problems. Otherwise, this immaturity may be expressed as overdependence on a parent.

As the charioteer uses the force of his will to bring together everything he needs for his journey, you move on toward a new relationship or career, although The Chariot can also show an important journey, learning or drive, or a new means of transport. At this time, you show great determination to get where you want to go -- and you will reach your destination. The horses represent libido, so there is also the frisson of sexual adventure here. The horses, dark and white, echo the dark and light aspects of the journey ahead. (Dean, 2008, 21)\nReversed Meaning\nEgo and arrogance bring problems.

As a general influence, in a reading, Justice argues for a reasoned, pragmatic approach to challenges as opposed to avoidance and denial, or extreme responses. Balance is all. (Dean, 2008, 22)\nReversed Meaning\nIn the reversed position, Justice shows a miscarriage or justice. A decision goes against you, or a straightforward situation becomes unnecessarily complicated and the true facts of the matter become hidden.

The Hermit also shows a recuperation period after an illness or operation. (Dean, 2008, 23)\nReversed Meaning\nEnforced isolation. Refusal to learn or listen to advice may result in withdrawal from others in anger or resentment. You may need more time to come to terms with a situation you do not wish to accept.

If provoked, be prepared to spend time in negotiation, and stand your ground. Aims can be achieved with quiet confidence rather then displays of overt strength. This card is also about internal conflict and the necessity of accepting your shadow side. In a generally positive reading, Strength also symbolizes good health.

As this card literally shows, you may need to hang around waiting for someone else to make a decision. In this case, there is little you can do but wait. Analyze the situation with detachment and you may see new opportunities from a distance, rather than obsess about an outcome you are powerless to change. (Dean, 2008, 26)\nReversed Meaning\nBetrayal, often of the self. You may shy away from making a life-changing decision because it means initial discomfort or expense, and even yearn to return to the life you has as a dependent child.

I don\u2019t really remember why, but I guess it must have been that I didn\u2019t have any welder to use and that aluminium could be soldered (or so I hoped, but it turned out I was partially wrong). My project included several stiff connections. Additionally, aluminium is somewhat bending- and blacksmithing-friendly.\nI think every M41a amateur constructor starts from papercraft, which is actually a good starting point for everyone who attempts to construct a bigger model. I based my model on a plan from a webpage that sadly does not work anymore - www.usmcblackwatch.feeserve.co.uk.\nTo be honest, my paper model was quite rough and quickly done (true and accurate models need a few days of making). All I needed was just a scale and something to look up to just in case.\nNext, basing on my model (and on a load of web images) I made tech plans and a template that was later used for cutting from aluminium sheets.\nI used Solid Edge 2D, a free and user friendly program. I needed to draw a flat plan and the program served the need perfectly.\nI based my plans on milimeters.

At first I planned to fit a tube for 40 mm gas grenade there; however, the case would be too big when compared to replica\u2019s overall width.\nI also had an idea to install a banger launcher inside. The construction of a slingshot with a guide rail seemed promising, but launching the banger posed a little problem. After each launch, there was just a short moment in time for taking a shot. As a result, my \u2018grenades\u2019 were exploding before even reaching the target.\nFinally, I decided to stick to the original replica\u2019s construction. I bought a cheap airsoft shotgun at local kermess, removed unnecessary accessories and shortened it as much as I could. It fit just right.\nThen, I drew a template for the shotgun\u2019s cover.

It was supposed to count down from 99 to 0. Well, it was quite a challenge, since I don't know much about electronics.\nI wanted to use IR diode and a photodiode, as it fit my possibilities. The moment the pellet was between these two elements, the ray of light was supposed to be interrupted and the counter was to be given the right information.\nIt turned out that the counter based on a photodiode works great when it comes to detect a pencil, but a pellet - not so much.\nThen I found a web page with a working pellet counter (programming is not my strongest skill either).\nhttp://jenswilly.dk/tag/airsoftroundscounter/\nThis solved most of my problems. The program worked exactly as I wanted; I was able to understand it and even to modify it a bit. The program counts from 180 to 0, but the counter display shows only two last digits. For me it is better this way.\nI switched photodiode to phototransistor and it started to work. Well, at least it detected a few series of pellets while shooting.\nOne year later I switched that phototransistor to type QRD1114 and it worked just as I wanted - it counted every single pellet shot and pellets shots in series.\nMy display consists of two 7-segment displays. That may not be the best solution, but it gives quite clear view and it\u2019s user-friendly. I soldered both displays to a universal board together with two buttons. One button manually switches the counter off and the other one resets the system.\nInside magazine\u2019s chamber I placed a microswitch that engages the counter whenever mag is put in, and switches it off whenever it\u2019s removed. So, everytime you switch mags, you reset the counter.\nI had to re-design the board in Eagle PCB program.\nI moved several elements, so that the board was more narrow and I changed smd elements to through-hole elements.\nI also added an ISP socket, in case I needed to make some changes in the code, and an off-switch to cut the power.\nI printed the project, placed it on the PCB laminate and used a pin to make dots - later solder points.\nAfter making all necessary dots, I connected them by drawing line paths with CD marker.\nAfter prepatrations, I placed the board in a jar filled with a solution of ferric chloride. The \u2018bath\u2019 took about 30-40 minutes. I had to stir it several times in the meantime, so that the process underwent evenly.\nThen, the board needed to be washed under running water.

Its cost closed in about 250$.\nBut... After several airsoft games it turned out that the \u2018aiming rail\u2019 is good enough only for shooting from the hip, and I\u2019m way behind Vasquez\u2019 level of badassness, so I had to add some genuine accessories. At the time I didn\u2019t want to change the gun\u2019s original look too much. That\u2019s why I chose MRDS aimpoint.\nTo install it, I had to add RIS rail in the middle of the bar. I used the plastic one that was part of my cheap shotgun. The aimpoint itself was nice, small.. and faulty. It didn\u2019t always work in the field. I couldn\u2019t figure out if it was because of the wind or rain. I tested it in the forest during springtime. After that, I tested Flip Flop, but I don\u2019t remember its producer.\nIn order to install it, I had to add two RIS rails - one in the back and one in the front. They were precise and durable. They also had wide regulation possibilities. I played with them during respawns.\nI had used them for a couple of months until I lost the sight somewhere during one big game. It was the time when the gun had already become commonplace and I didn\u2019t care anymore so much about sticking to the original look. I decided to install Eotech 551 clone. To be honest, it raised the aiming spot quite high, but such configuration made this gun more comfortable to use. It has worked flawlessly for two years now.\nOnce the external barrel slackenned off and I shot the phototransistor, that found itself in the shooting range. Since that accident, the counter display still works, but it doesn\u2019t react to shots. After a few shots the grenade launcher\u2019s pump handle cracked. The pin that was cropping out from the shotgun\u2019s slide was too small and it tore its socket in the handle.\nBut... After three years my replica still works. I built it to endure rough conditions, and I have to admin that I really didn\u2019t spare it. It survived heavy rains, snow, minus temperatures and heat. It survived close counter with mud and sand.

I have three kids... including a 5-year-old who wants to join in with her older brother and sister. We only had one working set (my son's Fireball Challenge set that we bought him a few years ago, and which hasn't seen a great deal of use) and a couple of add-on pieces. However, it was only suitable for two-person racing, and some of the curves were a little too advanced for my 5-year-old. Fortunately a relative had given us some second-hand track, cars, and (thankfully) a third controller that he'd picked up at a garage sale. Just perfect for an additional raceway! All I had to do was clean up the track (a story for another time) and get a third car in working order (also a story for another time).\nFast-forward a week or so, and my 5-year-old was happily racing her own AFX car around an independent track set inside her siblings' track. Unfortunately, the cords on the standard AFX controllers are very short, and 5-year-old excitement levels are very high. At one point my 5-year-old lifted her controller too high and pulled on the cord, dislodging her track and her siblings' track. After fixing up the track, we then discovered that her controller was no longer working. After some testing, and on further inspection, it turned out one of the wires had snapped right at the base of the controller.\nUnlike the old orange/yellow Aurora AFX russkit controllers (which are screwed together), the standard AFX controllers in more recent sets are glued together and are not designed to be user-servicable. They are notoriously fickle, and are designed to be thrown out and replaced rather than repaired. Depending on what the fault is, a repair may not possible - and there's no guarantee that you won't crack the casing or further damage the internal components while attempting a repair. However, with some basic tools, a little care and some patience, you should be able to open up that controller and repair some simple faults (such as a broken wire or loose contact), and you can even make some improvements on the basic design (eg. adding a longer cord) if you wish. If it's not working anyway, what have you got to lose?\nIn the case of a broken wire, soldering is not required (depending on where the break is, of course) but may be beneficial.\nI'm happy to report that my 5-year-old now has a fully-functioning controller with a longer cord (much to the envy of her siblings), and all for less than $1 AUD. You can buy factory-built Tomy AFX controllers with longer cords, and I'd ordered a couple of these from overseas before I considered repairing the controller myself. I wish I'd waited, as it turned out to be such an easy (and cheap) fix.\n(On a side-note, this is my first Instructable ever.

Do this a couple of times, pressing a little harder each time to make the scoring deeper. Mind your fingers! SAFETY TIP: Sit the controller on a cutting mat/board while scoring, as it will give you more control and stability than simply holding it in your hands.\nWorking on one small section at a time, continue scoring and pressing harder (within reason) until the blade pierces the seam. In some places there is a tab that runs under the seam - you don't have to cut through these (and the casing will probably fit back together better if you don't), but it's not a big problem if you do. Again, sit the controller on a cutting mat/board for more control.\nRepeat as above, until the seam is breached at a number of points around the controller.\nWedge a small flat-head screwdriver a short way into one of the breaches, and twist or lever the screwdriver to prise open more of the seam. Take your time, and avoid exerting too much pressure, otherwise you may damage the casing along the seam-edges or even crack the casing. Also avoid pushing the screwdriver too far into the casing, or you may damage its internal components. SAFETY TIP: Wherever possible, avoid using the Stanley knife to prise open the seam. If you absolutely have to do this in order to get the screwdriver in, consider wearing safety goggles just in case the blade snaps.\nContinue working your way around the seam. Using a combination of small and large flat-head screwdrivers, gently twist or lever them to prise open more of the seam. You may hear some internal cracks or pops - that's to be expected, provided that you're not sticking the screwdrivers in too far. It's probably just the glue or the plastic pins (refer below) coming apart. Take your time, work gently, steer clear of the internal components, and everything should be okay.\nEventually you'll get to the stage where you can start to pull the casing open with your bare hands. CAUTION: It's tempting to rush this step, and just pull the whole thing wide open. You may snap or crack the casing if you do, so proceed gently! There are five plastic pins holding the casing together, one at the base of the handle (just behind where the cord comes out), one at the \"thumb rest\" on the back of the handle, one just forward of the trigger, and two at the top (one at either end). You may have already cut or broken some of these in the steps above. Some may be glued tightly, and you may need to break the remainder of the pins before the casing comes apart completely. In my case, only one of the pins (top rear) survived unscathed - the pins at the top front and thumb rest had to be cut with the Stanley knife, and the one near the trigger snapped with a gentle application of force. The one that gave me real trouble was the one at the base of the handle - after I'd released everything else, I had to twist the two halves of the casing in opposite directions in order to break that last pin.\nLay the controller with its handle to the left, and remove the \"top\" half of the casing.

In this case though, there's a broken wire right at the base of the handle, so let's fix that.\nUsing the side-cutters, cut the wire neatly just below the break. This will give you a length of cord with the standard Tomy AFX plug at the end of it. Don't throw it out!\nSplicing the wire together right at the base of the handle is not going to be feasible, so cut the other end of the wire a little further up into the handle. This will have the added advantage of hiding the splice within the handle.\nStrip 2-3cm of insulation from the cut ends of each wire. OPTIONAL: If you want to lengthen the cord, cut some speaker wire to length (I added an extra metre) and strip the insulation from both ends.\nMatch up the striped wires, and splice them together first (this will help ensure that you match up each wire to its mate, so that the plug is wired correctly). Initially I had separated the strands of each wire into two groups to form a \"Y\", as I don't have a soldering iron and had planned to splice them together using this method for inline splices. However, I must have mucked it up because the end result was very weak and my splice basically just fell apart. So I just ended up going with a basic (and ugly) twist splice (also known as a pig-tail or rat-tail splice). Do whatever splice works for you.\nSplice the non-striped wires together.\nWrap each splice with a couple of turns of electrical tape to insulate it. OPTIONAL: If you've got nice neat inline splices, use some heat-shrink tubing instead.\nWrap the wire around the plastic pin inside the base of the handle and pass it out through the bottom notch.

I needed to cut another 12\" board to match it using my jig saw.\nI found that cutting this laminate was done best with a saw blade that had as many teeth as possible (mine was 20 teeth/inch). This worked great, until my blade dulled, then broke.

I wish I had a couple more spring clamps, but this seemed to work well. I left these a few hours and they were set enough to move onto the next step\n3) snap in and glue down two boards at a time (a course). I used plenty of glue and made sure each board was snug against the boards they were snapped.\n- notice that I aligned each course of boards with one side and all of them, except one, overlapped. These will need to be trimmed in the next step.\n4) Because I used the anchor board at the far edge, my courses ended with about 1/2\" of OSB sticking out.

You can use this project if you are a stressed out student like me or if you know someone who should relief some of their stress.\nWhen I heard we had to build something with Arduino I had no single idea what to do. So what does one do when they could use a little bit more inspiration? Yes, exactly! Go to the internet for help! I knew I needed something with clear instructions which didn\u2019t require me to have too much experience with coding. So after looking around on instructables and saving some projects that stood out to me, I chose this one (https://www.instructables.com/id/Animate-a-Billy-Bass-Mouth-With-Any-Audio-Source/?ALLSTEPS) because it seemed like a lot of fun and I thought I could really personalize it. A lot of credit goes to the writer of the linked instructable Donald Bell, I just added my own personal touch to his project.\nThe materials you will need for this Instructable are:\n\u00b7 A big mouth Billy Bass singing Fish\n\u00b7 An Arduino Uno\n\u00b7 An Adafruit Motor Shield v2\n\u00b7 A Panel-Mount mini jack\n\u00b7 A mini jack audio cable\n\u00b7 A mini jack splitter cable\n\u00b7 Hookup wire (preferably in multiple colours, I used black, white, yellow and red)\n\u00b7 A small rechargeable speaker\n\u00b7 An audiosource (you can use your mobile phone for this)\n\u00b7 Stress that needs to be relieved\nThe tools you need:\n\u00b7 A small screwdriver\n\u00b7 A soldering iron and solder\n\u00b7 Wire strippers", "title": "The Stressed Art Student", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Stressed-Art-Student/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Luckily for all of you animal lovers out there, you don\u2019t need a knife to cut this fish up, but rather a small screwdriver to undo the screws on the back panel.

After you have opened it up you can unplug the cable harnesses so that you can remove the back completely and have some more space to work. Then you should unscrew and set aside the fish\u2019s circuit board and the little piezo buzzer for some more space to put the electronics we will be adding.\nWhat you will be left with is the front of the fish with one 4-wire harness. Two of these wires lead to the mouth, and the other to lead to the little motor in the middle that moves the head or the tail. Now cut 4 pieces of wire in equal lengths (my wires were about 15 cm but you should do what works best for you). You can use any colours you want, but using colours of wire that are comparable to the ones in the cable harness seems less confusing.

If game play is going longer than a specified time (usually 75 minutes, but varies with league) and a team has not reached 13/15 points, a soft cap is given. The highest score is taken and two points are added - that is the new score to end the game. If soft cap is not reached within specified time (usually 10 minutes), hard cap is placed, meaning the game ends at the next point.\n4. Points are scored by advancing your disc from one end of the field to the end zone at the opposite side. The disc must be caught within the 25 m by 40 m end zone.\n5. The disc is advanced by being thrown from player to player. If the disc is dropped or if a defender intercepts the disc, it is a turnover and the other team may pick up the disc and try to start moving it to their end zone. Travels occur when the person catching the disc takes more steps then needed to stop their movement, or changes direction and speed while slowing down. Travels also occur when the player with the disc moves both feet - a pivot foot must be maintained.\n6. The person holding the disc has 10 stall counts to throw it to another player. If the stall count reaches 10, it is a turnover. Stall count is managed by whoever is guarding the person with the disc. They must be within 10 feet of the person with the disc and count out loud.\n7. If the person guarding the disc contacts the thrower - hits their hand or arm, or runs into their body - it is a foul.

This can cause strings to break.\nTo prepare yourself to tune the entire keyboard, it is helpful to spend some time tuning unisons (single notes). Since most keys on the piano have either 2 or 3 strings, the strings for each key need to be tuned to precisely the same pitch. Even with an electronic tuning aid, you will use your ear to tell when the strings of one key are in tune with each other. For now, don't worry about whether the key is tuned to the correct pitch relative to the rest of the keyboard.\nChoose a note with 3 strings to tune. (To start, the ones in the middle of the keyboard are easier.)\nDecide which string to use as a reference to tune the other strings to.\nMute one of the strings (see picture). This is done so that you only hear the string you're tuning and the string you're using as a reference.\nPlace the tuning hammer on the tuning pin for the string you are tuning. The handle should be pointing roughly parallel to the strings toward the inside of the piano.\nPull the hammer to bring the string slightly sharp of where it should be.\nMove the hammer back the other way until the string is in tune. As you do this, listen to the sound of the two strings carefully. When they are far out of tune, you will hear a fast beating in the sound, which will slow down as they approach the same pitch. If they are perfectly in tune, there will be no beating at all.\nOnce the two strings are in tune, mute the string you just tuned, and unmute the remaining string. Repeat the process for this string.\nNotes:\nThe method of bringing the string into tune from the sharp direction helps the pin to stay where you put it. If a string is flat and you simply bring it up to pitch by increasing the tension, it will tend to loosen on its own after a short time (like a spring unwinding, but slower).\nHaving the tuning hammer parallel to the string reduces the amount that your twisting motion can tilt the pin forward or backward, which would change the tension on the string until you release pressure on the hammer, causing error in the tuning.\nIt is better to use quick, short movements of the hammer, rather than long, steady ones. This improves the tuning stability. When you are starting out, you may need to move the hammer more slowly to practice listening to beating and train your ear to identify when strings are in tune.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGU/7YZR/IY4QFJNC/FGU7YZRIY4QFJNC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWT/LH12/IY4QFHWY/FWTLH12IY4QFHWY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Practice Tuning Single Notes"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Entropy is free and open source, and relatively easy to install if you have a common platform. It can be downloaded here.\nThe reason for using software to help tune a piano is that the non-ideal nature of the strings needs to be accounted for. If you were to tune a piano to ideal pitches (equal temperament), it would actually sound terrible, because the strings produce overtones that are not at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. Standalone electronic piano tuners and piano tuning software have ways of calculating how the pitch of each note should deviate from the equal temperament to make the harmonics line up better with each other. There are several programs that can do this; Entropy is not the only choice.

If you don't have cards then you will need money, or a generous friend, to get cards\n3. A creative mind\nElapsed Time:\nAnywhere from 15 minutes to a few days, depending on your skill level and dedication to the deck-building process.\nSo let's get started!", "title": "How to Make a \"Magic: the Gathering\" Deck", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Magic-the-Gathering-Deck/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "What type of player are you? Are you a more casual player looking for some fun in your downtime? Do you want to climb the ranks of the competitive community and be the top local, national, or even international player? What you want out of Magic will determine the format best for you. I will list some of the most popular formats that people play in. Decide which one best fits you and your needs.\nStandard: This competitive format plays cards from the most recent sets. After a recent change in the format, Wizards of the Coast (the company in charge of the game), decided to make sets rotate every year. This means that every year, the older sets will not be allowed in the format while the newest set(s) will be. Standard tends to be the most dynamic and unpredictable format, because rotations tend to completely change the way it is played. However, this also means that eventually you will have to change up or build completely new decks, meaning that you have to spend more money if you want to continuously play in this format.\nModern: Another competitive format that uses cards from the Eighth Edition set and forward. Unlike Standard, Modern doesn't rotate, so any cards from the allowed sets can be used, in addition to the newest sets. This format tends to be the fastest and one the most expensive, because it uses some of the best cards in Magic history. While new sets can shake up the format slightly, this one tends to be more stagnant than Standard, with the best decks staying at the top for long periods of time.\nCommander: This is the most popular casual format. What makes it unique compared to others is that you construct 100 card decks (instead of the usual 60) and you can only have one copy of each card. While not going into detail about the rules, Commander games, often played with 3 or more people, tend to be very explosive and unpredictable. Because of the multiplayer nature of the game, it is the most interactive and arguably the most fun out of all the formats. However, you won't see any tournaments in this format on the competitive level.\nI will briefly list other formats, both to save space and because I lack experience in these: Vintage, Legacy, Pauper, Frontier, to name a few more.\nNOTE: It is always important to be aware of the cards that are banned in each format to avoid unnecessary expense.\nPicture is from https://warosu.org/tg/thread/46178757", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSQ/DUND/IY3CURMR/FSQDUNDIY3CURMR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Decide What Format You Want to Play"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Once you have figured out what format you want to play, this can be the both easiest and hardest part of building a deck.\nDecide what type of deck interests you. Are you more of an aggressive player, going for the all-in type of approach? Or are you a more reactionary player who likes to control the tempo of the game until you can cast your huge creatures or planeswalkers? Maybe a mix of both? You could be the type of person that likes to bend the rules and use \"Alternate Win Conditions\", cards that will win you the game by themselves under the right circumstances, such as the one shown above.\nWhatever your style of play is, you can create a deck that you can both win and have fun with at the same time.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2I/AI1W/IY4Q5N32/F2IAI1WIY4Q5N32.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Decide What Type of Deck You Want to Build"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Once you have found the type of deck you want to build, the next step is to decide what Colors you want to build around. For beginning players, look at cards that interest you and base your decision around that. More experienced players will want to build a deck around an \"archetype\", where you play cards that work well with each other and have effects that collectively increase the power of the deck.\nAn example is the card shown above. It is a card with Red and Black colors. In addition it is a Vampire and has a very powerful effect that works well with the Madness mechanic and other Vampires. This card would therefore go best in an aggressive Red and Black deck with a Vampire/Madness theme.\nAs I will go into further detail later, you want to make sure that you don't have too many colors in your deck. Decks with 3 or more colors tend to be more inconsistent because you decrease the chances that you draw lands that produce the colors you need. Beginning players will want to stick to two or even one color decks because they tend to be easier to build and buying many different multi-colored lands can be expensive\nNOTE: This is not absolute and depends on the format. Some formats like Commander encourage you to play many colors because they are slower and more casual.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFH/K57W/IY4Q5IR6/FFHK57WIY4Q5IR6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Building Your Deck: Colors"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "With the basic outline of the deck done, now it's time to fill it in. Choose cards that work well together and support the theme of the deck. For aggressive decks you will likely want the a sizable portion of your spells to be low mana-costed creatures and pump spells. Control decks will want a lot of removal, cards that get rid of your opponent's creatures/planeswalkers/artifacts/etc and have very powerful cards that when cast will turn the game around in the later portion of the game. Combo decks will want to play the pieces of the combo and have cards that support and/or protect the combo from being interrupted. Always remember synergy. The more your spells play off of each other, the more powerful the deck tends to be.\nI will continue to use the example of the Red/Black Vampires to show you what kind of cards would fit well in that deck. Stromkirk Condemned shown above is great because it enables you to discard cards, which is fantastic in a deck that encourages you to do so. In addition it powers up all of your vampires when you do. Falkenrath Gorger is good by itself, because 2/1 creatures for 1 mana are always good in aggressive strategies, but in addition to that it gives all your Vampires Madness, so that you can cast them when you would normally discard. Fiery Temper is absolutely great in this deck. Normally it is a 3 mana burn for 3 damage, but with madness it costs only a single red mana! Stensia Masquerade not only gives your attacking creatures first-strike, a nightmare for your opponent to deal with, but when damage gets through every vampire that did combat damage to the opponent will get a +1/+1 counter.\nYou can have up to 4 copies of any particular spell in your deck. It is up to you to decide how many. A good rule of thumb is to put 4 copies of the most important cards in the deck and work your way down. Sometimes you might have to remove some copies of cards to make room for others.\nNOTE: This doesn't apply to Commander, because you can only have 1 copy of any particular card", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2U/BRAG/IY4Q5IAA/F2UBRAGIY4Q5IAA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7F/ZLAU/IY3CX8W9/F7FZLAUIY3CX8W9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9M/0BMV/IY3CX8WP/F9M0BMVIY3CX8WP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Z/3Q6S/IY4Q5IOQ/F8Z3Q6SIY4Q5IOQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Building Your Deck: Spells"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The mana curve is one of the least talked about, yet most important part about constructing your deck. The mana curve is simply the distribution of cards with a certain mana cost, and the curve comes from the shape of the graph, looking somewhat like a shifted Bell Curve or Normal Distribution curve. You want to be efficient with your mana since you can only play at most one land per turn. When you have found the cards you want in your deck, construct a mana curve so you can see how distributed your spells are.\nAggressive decks should have a mana curve that looks similar to the one shown above. Most of the cards in the graph have a converted mana cost of 2, and cards with mana costs of 1 and 3 are a close second. The amount of cards with mana costs of 4+ then makes a steep decline. This pairs well with the intentions of aggressive decks because they want to be able to cast many cheaper creatures/spells to beat the opponent as fast as possible.\nControl decks tend to have a mana curve shifted slightly more to the right than the above graph. Their peak would lie somewhere around the 3 or even 4 mana cost range because they are more about controlling the pace of the game until they can play their most powerful, high-costed spells.\nNOTE: Your mana curve does not need to be exactly like the one shown above even if you are playing aggressively, but when you create your deck, the shape of the curve should at least resemble it to some degree.\nPicture is from http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/183623/what_magic_the_gathering_can_.php?print=1", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIR/1F7P/IY4Q5DRQ/FIR1F7PIY4Q5DRQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Building Your Deck: Mana Curve"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "For decks of a single color, this is the simplest part, because they only require one type of land. However, it gets more complicated the more colors are in your deck. Decks with 2 or more colors will almost always need dual lands, lands that produce two colors, to make sure you get the multiple colors that you need.\nPut as many dual-colored lands in your deck as you can where it doesn't impinge on the play of the deck. For example, you might not want to run too many dual colored lands in a two-color aggressive deck because many dual lands come into play tapped if the conditions are not right, which prevents you from going as fast as you can. Slower more control-based decks have more leeway when using dual lands because they can afford to play a little slower.\nIn total, the total amount of lands in any particular deck can be anywhere from 18-26 lands, depending on how fast or slow it is. A good number for the average 60 card deck is about 24 lands. Test your deck with the lands you put in and see how well it plays.\nNOTE: This often depends on the format. The best dual-colored lands are in older sets, so decks in those formats will tend to want to play as many dual-lands as they can.\nPicture is from http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/magic-fundamentals/magic-general/606212-a-sets-basic-land-art-forming-one-image", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVQ/BQYY/IY4Q5QPN/FVQBQYYIY4Q5QPN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Building Your Deck: Lands"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "So you have constructed your deck. The last thing you need before you're ready to go out there and compete is a sideboard, a group of 15 cards from which you can put in and take out cards from your deck in between games.\nThink of a sideboard like an extension of your deck. Put cards into your sideboard that are better against specific kinds of decks that you see often. For example, if many people are playing artifact decks, put cards into your sideboard that get rid of or at least deal with artifacts. For those pesky creature-based aggressive decks you could put in boardwipes, cards that do damage to or destroy all creatures on the field.\nThe sideboard is one of the hidden arts of the game. It requires a knowledge of the current metagame, that is the kind of decks and cards that currently make up the majority of the playing field. The knowledge of sideboarding is something that will take a while to master, but once done will transform you from a good to a great player.\nPicture is from http://www.manaleak.com/mtguk/2016/03/5-things-magic-players-need-to-think-about/", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQO/CP0E/IY4Q5KG7/FQOCP0EIY4Q5KG7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Building Your Deck: Sideboard"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "The only way to truly gauge the power level of your deck is to use it.

I selected some pieces of timber framing from an old cabinet that was found at the tip and dismantled. These were 42x19mm in profile. The photos show the steps I took to end up with square and uniformly dimensioned pieces of wood. In order, I:\nA) used an electric planer to remove surface weathering and discoloration;\nB) used a combination square to mark damaged ends for removal and sawed these off square with an electric mitre saw;\nC) cut 295mm sections using mitre saw. To ensure these were the exact same length I stacked all five and clamped them so ends on the left hand side were square with each other. The ends on the right hand side were resawn, ensuring blade trimmed even the shortest length ever so slightly.

If you have a kit with dowel centering pins you can use this method:\nDrill two dowel holes in each end of the piece.\nFit centering pins into the two holes at the bottom and gently position the piece as you'd like it to sit on the bottom piece of the frame. I chose to set this piece on an angle because I thought it would help with an ergonomic guiro action.\nHolding the piece in its desired position, bang the top of the wood so pins mark drill points in the bottom.\nDrill the holes in the bottom then glue and dowel this join.\nPlace the dowel centering pins in the top holes. Line up the top plate as desired and bang with a mallet, indicating spots to drill dowel holes in the top. Drill these holes.\nFitting bangclank sheet\nMeasure the width of the slot now that left and right sides have been joined to bottom.\nThe height of the sheet you need will be the length of your sides (295mm), plus 2x the depth of your slot. I estimated needing a rectangle 220x315mm.\nUse a combination square and pencil to mark the rectangle you need on whatever sheet metal you are using.\nCut metal carefully with strong scissors or tinsnips. My steel sheet was 1mm thich but if you procure something thicker or with corrugations, consider using a cutting blade on an angle grinder or a hacksaw.\nSlide sheet metal into the slot and see if top piece of frame will fit nicely. I ended up needing to trim off another 5mm from the top of the steel sheet before the top fitted.\nGluing / dowelling top joins\nNow you're ready to join the top pieces. Same as above!\nBike bell\nI decided the bike bell was going to be a right hand operation. The bottom right corner of the frame seemed like the place it belonged. To fit here, and for screws to be driven without bell being in the way, the bracket needed some adjustment using a pair of pliers. Mark location of holes, pre-drill with small bit and attach bike bell. Ka ching!\nAttach rope\nTo hang the board around your neck you will need a rope or strap.

Of course there were a few people on the Table Tennis websites saying, don't do it, it's not worth the effort! But in reality, it's quite easy and a fun project to do.

Rotate the board so that you are looking at it length ways - in my case this played a bit of a trick on my mind, as the width (940mm) was slightly longer than the length (915mm). Starting at the one corner, secure the masking tape underneath, and slowly stick it down the side - take some time to do this properly - these are going to be your lines after all!\nDo the same for the other side line, as well as the back line of the board.\nFor the middle line, measure the distance from the edge to the middle. In my case it was 470mm - and then subtract half the width of the masking tape (18mm/2 = 9mm). Therefore the start of the tape was 461mm from the edge of the board. Make a little mark on either side of the board, and stick your masking tape down the middle. Make sure it's stuck down properly - you don't want any paint sneaking in underneath.\nRight, now it's time for the paint - I used a water-based chalkboard paint - I'm sure there are better options, but it works fine for my needs - you want it to be a paint with a matte finish, and the chalkboard paint fulfills that quite nicely. Using the foam roller brush, apply 2-3 coats. Again, make sure it's nice and even, and pick out any specks or blobs as you go along. When it's touch dry, you can peel away the lines - this is when you'll get your first sense of accomplishment!\nNow wait for the paint to dry properly, and then apply masking tape in the inverse way to previously, i.e. on the inside of the border lines, and on either side of the centre line. In retrospect, I should have used spray paint (make sure you mask the areas outside of the lines with newspaper) - as when I run my hands over the lines, there is a definite change in texture - I think spray paint would've made it a bit smoother. Once the new areas have been masked, you can now paint the white lines using the roller.

Although the main point of this Instructable is to show a general rehab and upgrade of a cheap Strat-style guitar electric guitar, I also wanted to show how to wire the one volume/one tone knob mod.\nBy removing one of the tone pots, making the remaining tone pot a master tone for everything and moving the pots down one position each, you avoid accidentally hitting the volume knob, and can adjust the tone for all pickups with just one knob. The downside is that you can\u2019t easily use your pinky for cool swells if you\u2019re into that.\nThe guitar being use is a 2002 Squire Bullet Stratocaster. I bought that new from Guitar Center for about $70 as something for my kids to play with. It served its purpose well but really hasn\u2019t been used for years. I have been looking to keeping one of my guitars setup for slide (with heavier strings). As this Bullet had a hard tail and not a tremolo bridge, it seemed like a reasonable candidate for this. The big problem on this guitar is that the pickups were extremely cheap, microphonic, and just bad sounding and are not suitable for any kind serious playing.\nThe entire project was done with parts I had laying around (except for the 5-way switch). So if you have to go out and buy a bunch of parts, this may not be worth doing.\nFor this Instructable I will be demonstrating:\nFitting replacement pickguard/pickups\nWiring the one volume/one tone pot modification\nShow that it's worth polishing and waxing an old, cheap guitar", "title": "Rehab and Upgrades for a Fender Squire Strat - Plus Two Knob Mod", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Rehab-and-Upgrades-for-a-Fender-Squire-Strat-Plus-/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "To get started I removed the pickguard to see what the guitar had in it.

It contributes to challenge the arc always in the same way.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0Y/9JW1/IXQG247C/F0Y9JW1IXQG247C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9R/MR5V/IXQG24BZ/F9RMR5VIXQG24BZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Grip: Default Vs Custom"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Below I explain how you can realize your personal grip using some flour, a balloon and Additive Manufacturing (AM) and 3D scanning techniques.

I report some examples.\nIn step 2, I mentioned to the polysurface creation process considering only two photos of the mold. The modeling of the polysurface following this approach is not suitable for beginners but it allows to obtain satisfactory results. In practice, you have to take two pictures, considering a horizontal and longitudinal sections. The mold is divided in 4 parts given by the intersections of the two photos. You can draw the contour lines and then create the slices of different surfaces starting from the control lines. The same for the riser.

As a result, I might not mention some special circumstances in the game of Go-Stop such as when only one player in a 3 person game loses (usually there is only 1 winner with the assumption that the other players have lost).

Another way you can shuffle the cards is to spread the cards out onto the table and mix them around.\nPicture 2\nThere are four cards that represent each month of the year with an accompanying flower.. The basic objective of the game is to match cards with their respective sets (i.e. match cards from January with another card from January). Don't worry, there's no need to memorize what month/flower a particular card belongs to. Instead, you can think of it as matching cards with a similar theme and design.

The dealer is responsible for shuffling the cards, handing out the cards, and playing the first hand. You can play a simple game of rock-paper-scissors to decide who becomes the dealer. Then, the winner of each game afterwards will become the dealer.\nAfter shuffling the cards, the player to the left of the dealer will \"cut\" the deck. The player takes the cut portion of the deck and places it face down in the center of the table. Then, the dealer proceeds to hand out the cards. If the dealer runs out of cards to deal, then the deck on the table will be used to continue the deal. Any remaining cards will be placed back on the center of the table.\nThe cards are dealt in a counterclockwise direction starting with the player to the right of the dealer. Once the dealer gets the cards, the cards are then dealt face up on the table. This process is repeated once. The way the cards are handed out is different depending on the number players. I'll include how the cards are supposed to be handed out, but as long as the number of cards is the same it is okay to ignore the specifics. As a side note, the game is usually played with 3 players, so the rules of dealing out the cards for 4 players and up are what I follow. Any cards left after dealing are added to the deck in the center of the table.\nThe cards are dealt as follows:\n2 Players - Each player gets 10 cards and 8 cards are face up on the table. (5 to each player and then 4 to the table. Repeat Once.).\n3 Players - Each player gets 7 cards and 6 cards are face up on the table.

However, I had some issues learning the dabbing method so I ended up gluing the cloth to one side, clamping, and coming back to put glue on the second side and clamping a second time. You can do it however works best for you.\nNote that alignment is critical. The cut slots between the disk halves must line up so you can cut the disks apart later. You not only need to align side to side and get the slots to line up but it is also critical to make sure the halves are aligned vertically so that neither side is higher than the other -- so they are flush. It helps to have the snake body on a hard flat surface, so I ended putting the clamps on top of the snake to help keep it flat.\nAfter the glue has set you can cut away excess cloth and sand the cloth area flush to the body.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ4/PQT2/IXQFV9XK/FZ4PQT2IXQFV9XK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXT/6F5E/IXQFUWAK/FXT6F5EIXQFUWAK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK0/9SFM/IXQFV9W4/FK09SFMIXQFV9W4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8J/3Q3F/IXQFUW8O/F8J3Q3FIXQFUW8O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F68/HKD3/IXQFV9XN/F68HKD3IXQFV9XN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F50/VV40/IXQFVA0R/F50VV40IXQFVA0R.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Glue the Fabric in Place and Clamp the Halves Together"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Take the middle section that is now back to looking like a dowel and go back to the band saw and cut into the existing saw blade slots.

For more about the details of this project, check out our blog.\nCD balloon hovercrafts are a tried and true instructional tool in the classroom for teaching the concepts of friction, air flow, momentum and a host of other physics concepts. There are a lot of other Instructables out there with different methods, like this great one from The Children's Museum of Houston. Use whatever method or materials suit your needs best.\nThese devices float rather well on any smooth surface, and depending on what size balloon you use and how much air you allow to escape, can work for several minutes at a time. They are quick to make for almost any age. We've added a design challenge component to the facilitation of this activity to both make the device work better and challenge the participants to add their own ideas to the activity. Building a Better Hovercraft is a great way to explain it. Traditional ones get some drag when the balloon deflates enough to tip over - how can we creatively solve this issue to make the hovercrafts travel further and faster? Read on to find out!", "title": "CD and Balloon Hovercrafts Engineering Challenge", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/CD-and-Balloon-Hovercrafts-Engineering-Challenge/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "We do ours with film canisters and CDs, both items that used to be readily available and either free or cheap. Alas, as the progress of technology marches on, both are becoming less prevalent in the world. You just can't pick up AOL CDs out of the street for this activity anymore! Fortunately, you can still find all of the necessary materials for this activity online and locally.\nFilm canister (a thread spool, cut piece of PVC pipe, sports drink nozzle, etc. also work well - most anything with a hole in it that will fit over the hole in the middle of the CD works fine). Most photo developing shops will give you their old ones for free, so check there first before buying online! I get mine in bulk on Amazon.\nCD - any old used CD or DVD will work. You can also pick up packs of blank CDs at most electronics superstores. I grab mine on Amazon for large classes.\nBalloon. I recommend a larger one (9\" or even 12\") as you can get a lot more flight out of them, and they are easier to stretch over the nozzle than the smaller varieties.\nHot glue gun and hot glue.\nLarge tack or small nail. I love these novelty size push pins for kids, as they have a large area to grip for safety and are not super sharp.\nPipe cleaners.\nCraft sticks.\nPaper and scissors. Markers are good for decorating, too.\nTape - I love masking tape for this activity.\nOptional: For large groups of kids, I get these balloon pumps from Target or party store and put a piece of vinyl tubing over the tip so that it fits the hole in the CDs. It makes it MUCH easier to inflate the balloons over and over again without removing them or going breathless trying to blow them up through the bottom of the CD. Most party supply stores will also stock balloon pumps. I also designed a 3D printable piece made out of flexible filament that can fit over the tip of the pump to lock the CD in place - the file is attached below.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHI/JSWW/J76GKEB0/FHIJSWWJ76GKEB0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO0/2CKA/J76GKEAZ/FO02CKAJ76GKEAZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Materials and Tools Needed"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "First, you'll need to build the base of your hovercraft. Take the lid off the film canister - you can save it for other projects or chuck it. Put a little glue on the open end of the film canister and stick it to the cd, trying to center it over the center hole in the CD. At this point, there isn't a good seal at the bottom of the film canister, so some air could escape out the sides. Add a good bead of hot glue around the rim of the film canister to completely seal it up. Allow the glue to cool completely before going on to the next step.\nNOTE: Don't get hot glue on the bottom of the CD, or else it will hang up when you're launching! If you get a bit and are already most of the way through this process, simply glue another clean CD to the bottom of your existing CD.

Poke a few holes - see how it works and you can always remove the balloon to add more. Be careful with this step to not stab yourself!\nIt's good to ask at this point how the number of holes changes the float dynamics of the hovercraft. Will more make it go faster? Float more?

Make sure it sits down a little bit on the canister - about 1/2-3/4\" or 12-18mm. This will ensure it doesn't fly off. At this point you can blow through the bottom hole of the CD to inflate the balloon, or use a balloon pump with a piece of vinyl tubing (1/2\" ID tubing works well) or the attached adapter file printed in flexible filament.\nAlternatively, inflate the balloon and twist the top, then slip it over the canister - this is much harder to do, but can sometimes be easier than blowing through the bottom of the CD, especially if you have very few holes in the canister.\nOnce the balloon is inflated, twist the top around a few times to prevent the air flowing out before you're ready to launch. You can also just pinch the balloon stem, especially if you build a structure in the next step that won't allow for twisting. Give your hovercraft an initial test, and seal any gaps left over from the first step if there are any. Notice how floppy the balloon is, especially if you give it a firm push?

Notes required; .... Key ....\n....C to d ; C,D,F,G,c,d ; F-major\n....D to e ; D,E,G,a,d,e ; G-major\n.\nWhere the two differ more substantially is in the accompanying chords.\nHydraulophone is like an underwater flute that has 12 mouthpieces, so it can play up to 12 notes at the same time! Therefore to make full use of the polyphony, let's consider the two options.\nHere are the chords in the the key of F-major:\nF, C, F, Bflat, F, C, Dminor, Gminor, F\nand here are the chords in the key of G-major:\nG, D, G, C, G, D, Eminor, Aminor, D, G.\nMany hydraulophones installed in public parks/waterparks, beaches, museums, etc., don't provide end users with access to the tuning screws or valves or any adjustments of key, or the like.\nThus, in F-major we'll play the Bflat chord rootless, and we'll play the Gminor without the Bflat, i.e. as a Gsus.\nIn G-major we'll play the D chord as a Dsus chord (i.e. omit the F# from the chord).\nIt sounds better in G-major, because roots are more important to chords than the 3rd element of the chord.\nAnd I kind of like the way the Dsus sounds.\nTherefore, let's start with the key of G-major.\nIn the following step, I'll provide my arrangement for Auld Lang Syne in G-major for the 12-jet hydraulophone.", "title": "How to Play Auld Lang Syne on Hydraulophone (underwater Pipe Organ)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Play-Auld-Lang-Syne-on-Hydraulophone-underw/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "In the above diagram is my arrangement for Auld Lang Syne on 12-jet hydraulophone, with notes running left-to-right, and time-axis running down the page.

The name \"matryoshka\" literally \"little matron\", is a diminutive form of Russian female first name \"Matryona\" or \"Matriosha.\"\n\nA set of matryoshkas consist of a wooden figure which separates, top from bottom, to reveal a smaller figure of the same sort inside, which has, in turn, another figure inside of it, and so on.\n\nMatryoshka dolls are often referred to as \"babushka dolls\", babushka meaning \"grandmother\" or \"elderly woman\".", "title": "A Plush Matryoshka", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Plush-Matryoshka/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I started by making a pattern consisting of a head, face, feet and belly.

Next I ironed the cheeks into place and sewed a satin (zig-zag) stitch around them.\nHair: I ironed HeatnBondLite to fabric scraps and arranged them on the face pattern circles before adhering them to the faces. I decided to experiment and tried out several different styles and colors. Then I sewed a satin stitch that matched each hair color along the bottom edge of each hairdo.\nEyes: I chose to use buttons for eyes. Don't sew them on at this point though because there are still parts of the face that need to be sewn. You can use bits of embroidery thread to experiment with different features and expressions before you commit.\nMouth: I chose to do simple smiles that extended into the cheeks. I lightly drew the smiles on with a pencil and sewed a black satin stitch over top, then I doubled back over it to make it darker.\nFace: To make it pop out from the background I outlined each face circle with a black satin stitch, then doubled back over the whole circle to make it darker.\nI suggest doing an image search of matryoshka dolls for inspiration when you make your own.

Then I stitched them together in the corners to hold them in place and trimmed the excess.\nThen I used each body front to make a pattern for the back. I didn't worry about matching the front and back fabrics. The more patterns the merrier in my opinion.\nI ironed stabilizer to the back pieces as well. If I were to make these again I might try adding batting and a lining fabric for each one instead of stabilizer to make them a bit plumper.\nAt the last minute I decided to add a loop of ribbon to the top of each one as a hanging device.\nFinally, I placed the front and back panels together, outsides facing in, and with my serger sewed around the periphery of each doll. Then I reached in the belly holes, turned them right side out, and ironed them flat.\nFor the smallest doll, simply attach a back fabric and sew the two pieces together leaving a small opening at the bottom.

If something gets messed up, you can use a hair dryer to warm the hot glue so you can work with it again.\nTuck the end!\nTrim the leather about a half inch longer than the end of the pipe.

We noticed whenever we were visiting friends or at preschool they constantly want to use the play kitchen and pretend to cook. Also, at home, we have a stool they use to hang out at the kitchen counter and they're constantly checking out what we're making or wanting to help out. We could've just bought a nice kitchen from Costco or wherever but this way it would be special, something they'd remember, and something that would definitely last a long time! Now that Christmas is done we are happy to report this was a HUGE success, therefore I am more than happy to share it!\nI got some ideas from here on Instructables and Reddit. We found a used unit for free on Kijiji and I started planning it out and getting more ideas.\nMaterials & Tools:\nA big wooden TV entertainment centre/unit\nScrewdrivers\nDrill with appropriate screw and drill bits, circular saw bits\nPaint brushes\nJigsaw\nTable Saw\nCircular Saw\nPutty knife\nBelt/palm sander\nSandpaper - Heavy grit and medium-light.\nVarnish remover\nWood Glue\nWood Filler\nTape Measure\nCarpenter's Square\nBox Cutter\nPen\nPaint\nPainter's tape\nChalkboard paint\nSpray-paint\nPolyurethane (protective coat)\nExtra cupboard door Hinges\nCupboard door handles\nSink Faucet\nStainless steel dish\nPlywood - (1/2\" x 2' x' 4') for doors\nHardboard (1/4\" x 4' x 4')\nParticle Board (1/4\" x 2' x 2')\nPlexiglass (1/4\")\nGel paints\nGorilla Glue", "title": "Play Kitchen From Old Entertainment Centre", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Play-Kitchen-From-Old-Entertainment-Centre/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Start by taking off all the doors, knobs and hinges with a screwdriver or drill. Set aside any shelving and shelf holders it may have come with. Don't forget to save all the old screws and hinges and knobs! I also ended up cleaning the hinges/knobs after taking them off. The rear \"wall\" is cheap, very thin plywood which I took off and removed all the nails holding it. I discarded the old plywood (crumbling apart and had the precut holes in it).\nI used Minwax Paint & Varnish remover to strip the old, thick varnish on the whole unit. It is like a gel, and you just goop it on, leave it for 20-30 minutes, then scrape it all off with the putty knife, hoping the old varnish and some stain goes with it. It is pretty messy stuff. Don't forget to use eye protection and gloves! I used it on every surface, although the outside frame seemed to have more coated on. It would leave lots of dirt and gunk behind so I used Methyl Hydrate to clean it up and dry it all out, making it easy to wipe down after.\nNext is the fun part, and by far the most time consuming: Sanding. I used both a palm sander and just by hand to sand it down - starting with 40 grit ( I realize now I did not need to go that low, as the varnish remover did most of the stripping work) I worked up to 80 and 180, then 220 grit in some spots. In hindsight, I'd have been fine with 60-80 and finish with 180, much less work that way.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FEL/28OG/IXGFSLDC/FEL28OGIXGFSLDC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLE/32KJ/IXGFSMLJ/FLE32KJIXGFSMLJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7P/3A5Z/IXGFSLDJ/F7P3A5ZIXGFSLDJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS4/4J6E/IXGFSLP5/FS44J6EIXGFSLP5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGD/RBHC/IXGFSLM5/FGDRBHCIXGFSLM5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF3/18PB/IXGFSM4N/FF318PBIXGFSM4N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F86/GWRG/IXGFSM6K/F86GWRGIXGFSM6K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS9/HJMB/IXGFSLLU/FS9HJMBIXGFSLLU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3Y/ILMF/IXGFT6SB/F3YILMFIXGFT6SB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Strip the Entertainment Centre"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I used the 1/2 inch plywood to make 2 doors that would fit on the right side of the unit: the upper right for the fridge and lower right for the oven.

I also used wood filler at this point on some of the knots in the plywood, then sanded the 2 doors down until nice and smooth.\nNext I measured out where the faucet and sink would go. I flipped the bowl upside down and traced the edge. Also traced where the 2 pegs from the faucet would go. Measuring the width of the faucet pegs, I used the appropriate paddle bit for the drill and drilled through the frame. Next, I traced another line just inside of my sink tracing, to allow the lip of the bowl to rest on the frame. Drilled a hole through the sink location so I could then use the jigsaw to cut the big sink hole.\nThe faucet came with it's own plastic interface to clamp on. The lip of the bowl is just resting on the counter. If the kids keep punching it out when playing I can always try gluing it down with Gorilla glue.\nNow the 4' x 4' piece of thin plywood was screwed onto the back side as a solid rear wall of the unit.

I painted these aluminum. Next I screwed 4 right into the counter by the stovetop, but just left it loose enough to spin around the centred screw. The other 2 went right above the oven. Next I cut thin pieces of plywood as the top knob pieces, painted them black. Finally, these were glued right on to the knobs over top of each screw, allowing the whole thing to still turn.

After some research, he found Bodyweight Fitness (BWF) on Reddit. The support materials and videos are impressive. One of the great things about BWF is that it does not require weights. However, it does require a place to do a few exercises. I was surprised that I could not find a simple plan to build a gym for these exercises. So we decided to make one!\nMy goals in building this gym were:\n- Inexpensive (I went through several designs and kept simplifying them. Eight 2x4s and two 3 foot 1\" cast iron pipes along with fasteners are all you need)\n- Compact (my wife permitted me to put in our bedroom. We don't have a lot of space)\n- Easy to build and easy to use!\nThe total build time was about 3 hours. (Don't let all the steps fool you. The build was easy!)\nP.S. If you want to check out our one year challenge we have a website and blog that will be updated throughout the year here.

If one was noticeable longer than the other, then I corrected it as I opened it back up to about 90 degrees.\nI then took each side and bent them about 1/4\" away from the circle so the remaining parts were parallel, about the width of the base of a PEZ dispenser. At this point I held the clip flat, and bent each side down about 45 degrees about halfway down the remaining straight portion, then back up on the remaining portion closest to the ends.\nThe clips can be bent further once mounted, if they are not straight or parallel.

I cut 3/4\" plywood in strips at 1 3/4\" and screwed them onto strips at 3 1/2\", so that each tier was 1 3/4\" deep. The screw holes are 1 1/2\" back from the front of each tier, and 11/16\" in from the ends.

I predrilled all the screw holes before painting. That helped immensely.\n2. I chose to make a display case (not going into much detail in this instructable) that I could put glass sliding doors on, and the depth of the case I made allowed for 3 tiers. I put in 3 shelves, with the additional tiers removable on the top two shelves but fixed to the bottom shelf. I also made each tier piece only half the width of the shelves, so I could leave one or two out as desired to display other sorts of PEZ items that couldn't go into these stands. You can see in the first pic here the shelf goes straight across but there is a gap at the middle of the tier pieces. They just sit on the shelf with nothing fastening them. In the second pic you can see I left one out to show an example of how I could display other items by removing the tiers.\n3. I had originally meant to have each dispenser facing straight forward. However, after mounting several, I felt I got a better view of each back row if I turned them slightly to see a side profile. This meant that when I turned them to the right, only dispensers with narrow heads would fit all the way to the right side when placed in the case, as the larger heads would now bump into the sides of the case. Not a big deal, but if you were to do something similar you could adjust the distance in for the first hole in each row.\n4. Early on I thought I'd try to color coordinate each clip with the dispenser base. I gave up on this early on, as it would mean I'd have to move clips any time I'd buy a new PEZ dispenser. For instance, Garfield and Spongebob have so many variations of their dispensers, that if I found one I didn't have and kept them grouped together, I'd have to try to match the clip to the base and move a lot of stuff around.

I mean, It would take forever to hand sand each piece, and they are too small to use anything powered. Well, you put it back in the holes that the pieces came out of. Then you can sand without shooting them halfway through the drywall across the room (total dramatization, didn't happen,,, more than once). I used 220 grit sandpaper on a random orbital sander to do all of the sanding.\nNext was the stain. And here is where I once again made the mistake of trying to use poly-stain all-in-one crap.

Having your measure out equal amounts to make a cocktail to immunise them from zombies. We had 4 vials one being a trap of chilli so choose wisely. The others where vodka.

It will vary based on how thin you roll it out, but half of a silicone tube ends up being about 12 in by 18 in if you roll it thin enough.\nUse your hands to knead the silicone into a ball (make sure they are soapy first or it will stick to you), keep it in the water as much as possible to keep it from getting too sticky. When it's in a nice ball set it on your working surface (again, make sure it's soapy. To do this I just scoop a little water from the bowl and smear it around). Use your palm to make a depression in the middle and add some food coloring. If you want it really vibrant then you will have to add quite a bit because the dish soap kind of dilutes it.\nCarefully knead the color in; this part is a little awkward since the coloring has a tendency to drip off at first, but keep at it and you'll get it eventually. Note: I find it easiest to knead mostly in your hands rather than on the table, but do what works for you.\nOnce it's the color you want begin rolling it out on your prepared surface with a rolling pin that has been dipped in soapy water. Be sure to start with it in the center of the surface so it doesn't squish over the edge, unlike dough this is not easy to pick up and reposition.

First I did the basic frame out of plywood since balsa is to soft to handle a building of that size.

This was done with three pieces of forex, shish kebab sticks and toothpicks. That piece will be painted and then glued to the wall of the stable.\nNext, for the door you need more pieces of wood (I used balsa, but it turned out to be too soft, so use something else) to drill a hole through. The doors are balsa rectangulars and are just glued to the drilled pieces. Mind you, if you want your door to open and close you must glue every OTHER drilled piece to the beam of the door otherwise it won't be able to rotate on its' axis and therefore will not open. Or close, depends in which position you glue the pieces.\nThe roof needed to have an opening in it for the hay, of course. The construcion is really quite simple, four beams, a crossbeam and diagonal beams which really hold the structure together. Leave it to dry overnight. Next, add plywood to the roof and start tiling. When you leave the roof construcion to dry, you can prepare your carboard for tiles. Just calculate the surface of the roof, add an extra 20% for good measure and cut ot the needed amount of cardboard. I used carboard from frozen pizza packaging. Paint them with a large brush. Just run them over casually, you don't have to be precise. I used a tone of red and brown. Just put those two paints on the cardboard and rub them with a large paintbrush. Let dry.\nAfter everything is dry, cut the strips from your painted cardboard and then cut them to little pieces. Mine were approx. 10x15mm. Put them all in a container and mix them. I wanted to make the roof look like randomized tiles, but in the same tone. You will acheve that by really mixing the pieces. Next take one piece at the time and glue it on to the roof. Repeat. This is a long and repetetive process so have patience. Once you are done, you can coat the whole roof with a layer of PVA glue, just be sure that the glue is transparent when dry.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWA/S9D6/IX0PYFQL/FWAS9D6IX0PYFQL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAJ/SJHE/IX0PYEWC/FAJSJHEIX0PYEWC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE0/XWQO/IX0PYFGX/FE0XWQOIX0PYFGX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8T/KSLP/IX0PYF3J/F8TKSLPIX0PYF3J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY4/YDUZ/IX0PYF1T/FY4YDUZIX0PYF1T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCP/MM8H/IX0PYFA4/FCPMM8HIX0PYFA4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR4/R5IE/IX0PYFA3/FR4R5IEIX0PYFA3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH4/MEEM/IX0PYF6T/FH4MEEMIX0PYF6T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEO/ZOQH/IX0PYF7W/FEOZOQHIX0PYF7W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN0/G0CS/IX0PYFVN/FN0G0CSIX0PYFVN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSW/KXYD/IX0PYG3V/FSWKXYDIX0PYG3V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ2/KFP5/IX0PYGMR/FJ2KFP5IX0PYGMR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5X/0PL8/IX0PYGOC/F5X0PL8IX0PYGOC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDM/8753/IX0PYGTZ/FDM8753IX0PYGTZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTW/5MIA/IX0PYH4M/FTW5MIAIX0PYH4M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY7/59XD/IX0PYID2/FY759XDIX0PYID2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: The Stable/barn"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "I did most of the things simoultaneously since one part is getting dry, you can work on the other.

This version can work without the 10th piece because each one of the 9 pieces has 3 faces (one it's empty, the other one had the X, and the last one has the O).

Truly a fun game that fueled the imagination of many a kid in the 70s and 80s!\nLast year, I bought my kids an updated version of the game for them to enjoy. The game has been modernized, including a new game board that, while pretty, has been shrunk down such that the \"monster\" and \"treasure\" cards no longer fit inside of the rooms in the dungeon! Instead, when a monster is discovered, and/or takes your treasure, rather than leaving the monster/treasure cards in that room, you place a small number in the room, and drop the cards in a corresponding slot in a \"look-up table\" on one side of the game board. Kinda lame, and slows down the game unnecessarily. Surely the makers of \"Dungeon\" must have known that having to complicate the game was a risky sacrifice to make for shrinking the game board down to save a few cents on cardboard?!?\nTo correct this, I decided to enlarge the game board such that my kids could play the game by dropping cards into the dungeon rooms directly, without having to use the second-rate look-up table and place-holder numbers. As I researched options, I realized that if I'm going to go through the trouble of remaking a game board, why not really remake it, and represent the multi-level dungeon as a multi-level dungeon? That is, rather than represent the dungeon's six levels as a single \"floor plan\" like the original 2-D game board, why not build a six-level dungeon, with corridors, stairs, rooms, doors, and secret doors, more like a \"model\" of a dungeon?\nAs an Autodesk employee, I have access to the equipment at Pier 9 in San Francisco to help me fabricate one.

First, I broke the single model up into nine smaller models (3x3), each representing a section/level of the dungeon. The joints between these pieces followed the edges of the walls, so each of the nine pieces is irregular, and they fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. Then for each piece, I manually traced 2D contours at 1/4\" intervals (each plywood lamination is 1/4\" thick). There were 34 \"contour templates\" in all. Each \"contour template\" defined between one and 8 wood pieces to be laser-cut, depending on whether it represented a floor plate or horizontal slice through a wall section.\nFor each floor plate that is more than 2 contours thick, I hollowed out the middle contours, making each a \"ring\" preserving the contour edge but open in the middle to save on material and weight.\nThen I arrayed all the \"contour templates\" for each lamination, laying them all side-by-side in a single data file. Since my free version of SKP doesn't export to DWG, I contacted a friend who happily converted the geometry using SketchUp Pro. He sent me back a DWG file, complete with all 34 \"contour templates,\" that I could open in AutoCAD for final arrangement.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHM/CED7/IWWFLQNV/FHMCED7IWWFLQNV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: The Contour Templates"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "On a visit to San Francisco, I booked a day at Pier 9 to use their Epilog Laser Cutters. Having taken the training course a couple years earlier, I took a brief refresher with one of the instructors, who helped me determine that the best workflow was to save each \"contour template\" separately, with red lines for engraving linework and green lines for profile cuts. We then brought each file into Adobe Illustrator, made minor modifications to lineweights, and sent each \"contour template\" to the laser cutter. Pieces like floor plates that had linework engraved had to be sent in two passes: once for the linework, and a second time for the profile cuts.\nThe Epilog machines could handle 1/4\" plywood pieces 2'-0\" x 3'-0\", which means I could fit between 2 and 3 contour templates on a sheet. In all, I used 26 sheets of plywood with about 1/3 of it as \"off-cuts\" for recycling/re-use.\nLaser-cutting was s-l-o-w, and it took about 12 hours of cutting (feeding plywood, modifying and sending data, watching the machine cut, and carefully removing cut pieces, some of which were pretty fragile), which made for a pretty long day on my feet! Watching a laser cutter in action is a bit like watching grass grow, but the risk of a fire is too great to leave it unattended, so it's really time you have to put in when laser-cutting plywood.\nAt the end of the day, I had over 500 pieces of plywood to stack and arrange, but even \"dry fit\" the pieces began to take shape, and the scale of the entire dungeon became apparent: at 36\" x 42\" it is huge!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLI/5QEP/IWWFLQQ9/FLI5QEPIWWFLQQ9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F29/TEC1/IWWFLQGC/F29TEC1IWWFLQGC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCU/2HB8/IWWFLQQ8/FCU2HB8IWWFLQQ8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOG/MHT7/IWWFLQGF/FOGMHT7IWWFLQGF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Laser-Cutting"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "To get my 500+ pieces of plywood back home from San Francisco, I had to ship them via FedEx.

This wasn't bad, but since the original game board was so brightly color-coded to indicate each level of the dungeon, I decided to color the rooms as well before gluing the walls onto the floor plates.\nTo do this, I used cheap watercolor paints readily available in any craft/art store. For the first (top) dungeon level, I used a yellow wash. Second was orange, third was red (rose), fourth purple, fifth blue, and sixth green, just like the original gameboard coloring. I also tried to increase the value (darkness) of each level color, so the coloration got darker the lower you got into the dungeon (from pale yellow to dark green).\nI masked each room to keep paint pigment off the door thresholds and corridors. Unfortunately, the painter's tape did a poor job of masking watercolor wash on fresh plywood, so in some spots the colors bled across the threshold.

It's a warm grey/brown wash (cooler than the sides of the walls, but also paler and lighter to allow the wood grain to show through). I'm really pleased with the tone and finish that it produced, and brought a look of professionalism to the model that was lacking prior to the decision to stain the top surfaces.\nI was also pleased that the \"Watermark\" I engraved into the top surface continued to show through the stain, preserving its one-of-a-kind branding.

It would have probably been easier with nicer equipment, but it got the job done. The cutter works via the \"score and snap\" method. It can be difficult to cut all the way through glass without causing shattering or unwanted breaks, but if you etch a line into the glass and apply force on either side, there will be a controlled break along that line.\nTo cut glass, you apply pressure to the cutting wheel and pull the cutter along the line you want to break. You should hear a scratching sound. Then, apply force to either side, and if all goes well, the glass should break on the line. If the glass does not break right away, you can flip the glass over and try a new etch on the opposite side. You can also tap along the line with the ball on the end of the cutter to try to get a break started. In my experience, this leads to a less clean break, so it should be a last resort, but I found that it was sometimes necessary, especially to break off small pieces.\nWith my very limited experience with cutting glass, I initially thought it would be easiest to cut my big pane into small rectangles, then cut the corners off to form hexagons. This was both a terrible idea, and didn't work at all. I couldn't get the glass to break along my first score, and when I forced it, my glass broke along a curved path, which luckily only ruined some of my glass. Thankfully, I was working on the edge of the pane at the time, so most of the glass was left unscathed.\nSo, it was time to consult the internet. After doing some reading on the score and snap method, I learned that my initial attempt was destined for failure. When cutting glass, the closer you are to the center line of your glass, the easier and cleaner the snap will be. Not only that, but it becomes impossible to break off pieces that are close in size to the thickness of the glass.\nWhat I ended up doing was cutting my glass into quadrants, then cutting each quadrant in two. From there, I used my copy of Catan to trace hexagons onto the glass and etch along the lines. For each line I cut, I would trace my line using a permanent marker, then clamp a piece of wood to the glass. The purpose of the wood was to act as a straight edge, and the clamp helped it to stay in place while I etched my line (which gave me both hands free, and held the straight edge more steadily than I could have using my hands). This worked reasonably well, and I was able to get a lot of hexagons this way. I was able to get about 40 from my pane of glass, but I'm confident I could have gotten maybe as many as 60 if I had known at the start what I learned through the process. 40 was perfect for me, though, because I wanted to make 2 sets (19 tiles per set), and it was good to have a few extra in case of mistakes. Unfortunately, many of the hexagons had unclean breaks or sharp edges that needed to be fixed, so this was not the end of the job. It's important to cut your hexagons as close as possible to the correct size. You can grind down the edges, but it takes a very long time (or at least did for me).\nIf I had to do it again, I would do things slightly differently. It turned out that the easiest and cleanest breaks for hexagons occurred when I had a equilateral triangle and just had to break off the points. This also gives you some nice little triangles that can be used as ports.

This is where a tile grinder might come in handy, but all I had was my little rotary tool. After trying a few different grinding stone bits, it was obvious that this project would consume way too much time going that route. The stones ground away faster than the glass did. I ended up buying some diamond grinding bits, which worked much better.\nNote: When doing this, wear eye protection, gloves, and a mask. You don't want to be breathing in the glass dust.\nI also found that clamping down my rotary tool and holding the glass to the grinding bit worked very well. Holding the glass in one hand and the rotary tool in the other took much longer and tended to result in uneven edges. After many, many hours of grinding (and annoying my neighbors to no end, I'm sure... It's loud... ear protection may be a good idea.), I had all of my hexagons to the right size and with dull edges.\nAt this point, it's a good idea to test your tiles by laying them out as you would for a game. My tiles were not all identical, so there were some small gaps. The gaps are small enough, though, that they don't affect the gameplay, so I decided to call it good.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFI/ZFN3/IWMFD4SF/FFIZFN3IWMFD4SF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Fine Tuning the Hexagons"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "I don't really care for painting, so this part was more of a chore than anything else, but the results were worth it. The painting needs to take place in two steps. First, apply the pattern to the glass with liquid leading. This keeps your colors separate and gives your tiles that authentic stained glass look. I first drew my patterns on paper, then put my tiles over the drawings so that I could trace rather than free hand. I found most of my patterns by just doing an image search, but made some adaptations to them so that they would be easier to draw on small tiles. There are 3 stone, 3 brick, 4 wood, 4 wheat, 4 sheep, and 1 desert tiles. I also used some triangles left over from when I was cutting glass for harbors. There are 9 harbors, 1 for each resource, and 4 wild-card.\nThe bottle of liquid leading that comes with the paint kit that I got had a nozzle that supposedly allowed for the application of designs directly from the bottle. Doing that clearly takes a lot more finesse than I am capable of, so I had to come up with some other way. I found that a syringe with a metal applicator tip worked nicely. Using that, I could control the flow very well, and the metal tip had a small enough opening that I could do reasonably intricate designs. I'm not sure where you would purchase something like this... We use these where I work, so I was able to use one of the extras.\nOnce you've applied the leading to the tile, it has to dry at least 8 hours before adding the other paints. Color them to your hearts desire. I used the tool that came with the paints to scoop paint onto the tile, then pushed it around with the back end of the tool. Lay on the paint pretty heavy. It lightens up considerably once it is dry. I don't think you are supposed to use brush, but I didn't try, so I couldn't speak to that. Once they're painted, wait 24 hours to dry.\nA final step that turned out to be pretty important is to seal the stained glass with an acrylic sealer. The paint I used is meant to be washable, so I was worried that the paint would easily rub off if I didn't seal it. I just used a cheap spray acrylic sealer, and it worked nicely.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FW9/6IXH/IWGPIDR2/FW96IXHIWGPIDR2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM6/BLLC/IWGPIDR3/FM6BLLCIWGPIDR3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV0/PWC2/IWGPIDW1/FV0PWC2IWGPIDW1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGF/K438/IWMFD4MF/FGFK438IWMFD4MF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4V/BKYQ/IWGPIE0Z/F4VBKYQIWGPIE0Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPZ/KTDJ/IWGPIE10/FPZKTDJIWGPIE10.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOF/N9YK/IWGPIE60/FOFN9YKIWGPIE60.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4J/A4DZ/IWMFD4KH/F4JA4DZIWMFD4KH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO7/BCUX/IWMFD6NI/FO7BCUXIWMFD6NI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKL/94HZ/IWMFD6NW/FKL94HZIWMFD6NW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEQ/AQ5Q/IWMFD8T9/FEQAQ5QIWMFD8T9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOA/XRCE/IWMFD7EN/FOAXRCEIWMFD7EN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK5/B45O/IWMFD7F9/FK5B45OIWMFD7F9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLE/9VFO/IWMFD7FO/FLE9VFOIWMFD7FO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9P/A8H4/IWMFD7KR/F9PA8H4IWMFD7KR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVI/D0J9/IWMFD7MS/FVID0J9IWMFD7MS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFD/75F7/IWMFD7OV/FFD75F7IWMFD7OV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU7/IQ2S/IWMFD7QY/FU7IQ2SIWMFD7QY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F48/2NZA/IWMFD7R6/F482NZAIWMFD7R6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7Y/1BWY/IWMFD7S6/F7Y1BWYIWMFD7S6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F78/VWVM/IWMFD7UU/F78VWVMIWMFD7UU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA8/MZMA/IWMFD7XB/FA8MZMAIWMFD7XB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0K/R5C7/IWMFD4RU/F0KR5C7IWMFD4RU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3Y/840G/IWQVD0PJ/F3Y840GIWQVD0PJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FER/6H4E/IWMFD4RC/FER6H4EIWMFD4RC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQW/M5DZ/IWMFD4QD/FQWM5DZIWMFD4QD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU2/048B/IWQVD108/FU2048BIWQVD108.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAI/EJTX/IWQVD12G/FAIEJTXIWQVD12G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0Z/CNNI/IWQVD0X1/F0ZCNNIIWQVD0X1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F44/7C1Q/IWQVD13E/F447C1QIWQVD13E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUA/HC2Z/IWQVD0Y6/FUAHC2ZIWQVD0Y6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBX/GC42/IWQVD0TM/FBXGC42IWQVD0TM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS1/HZKY/IWQVD0UO/FS1HZKYIWQVD0UO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Painting"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "At this point, your tiles are pretty much ready to go. The problem is, they look much better when light is shining through them than they do when just sitting on a table. Solution: Build a base with a surface that lights up.\nFirst, you need a design. To that end, I laid out my tiles on a big piece of paper as they would be during a game and traced around the edge with a pencil. Then, because the wood that I chose to use was 1/2\" thick, I measured 1/2\" out and drew lines so that I had the outline of my base. Originally, I wanted to make it so that the wood was immediately next to the glass at all points, but after tracing that out, it looked like more work than I was willing to put in. Instead, I decided to leave a little extra space next to the harbors so that there would be fewer cuts to make. Once I had this design, I marked where the joints would be so that I could see the size and shape of the pieces I had to cut.\nEven though my tiles weren't perfect hexagons and so didn't lay out perfectly symmetrically, I wanted my base to be symmetric. For my design, this meant that I would only need 3 types of pieces, with 6 of 2 types and 3 of the third. In my drawing, I measured the lengths of every piece of the same type and averaged them together to get the length to cut.\nNow that that's out of the way, it's time to get out the miter saw. My design is nice in that you can set the saw at 30 deg and leave it there for every cut. Most of the cuts are 30 deg, but there are a few that are 60 deg, for which you just hold the wood perpendicular to the guard instead of parallel. See the pictures for more details.\nNext, the pieces need to be glued together to form the frame of the base. If you're like me, you don't have fancy clamps that can hold wood together at an angle. Instead, I used both wood glue and hot glue. The hot glue dries very quickly and holds the wood together while the wood glue dries much more slowly, but creates a stronger bond. It's a good idea to set your wood out in the appropriate layout and glue one piece at a time so that it comes together correctly.\nAfter the glue has dried, you can use the wood frame to trace out plywood to close up one side. On the other side will be some frosted plastic, so it is a good idea to trace out the design on that as well before you seal up the bottom with your plywood. Use a jig saw to cut out the design from the plywood, then glue it into your frame. I wanted it to be as close as possible to flat, so I used some textbooks to hold it down while the glue dried.\nBefore too long, we'll be adding some lights to the base, so now is also a good time to drill a hole for the jack that will supply power to the lights. At this point, everything that will be visible when the base is complete is finished, so you should stain the wood before proceeding any further.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ6/JSN3/IWMFD6KX/FQ6JSN3IWMFD6KX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBT/F7CU/IWMFD60S/FBTF7CUIWMFD60S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGO/TQRY/IWMFD618/FGOTQRYIWMFD618.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFE/YJVM/IWMFD62D/FFEYJVMIWMFD62D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPR/AB5S/IWMFD6IS/FPRAB5SIWMFD6IS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLW/WMOX/IWMFD6HK/FLWWMOXIWMFD6HK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ5/JH9X/IWMFD6J8/FJ5JH9XIWMFD6J8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRT/LUN0/IWMFD6I5/FRTLUN0IWMFD6I5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDI/YSMH/IWMFD5Q5/FDIYSMHIWMFD5Q5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F77/L6GZ/IWMFD6IJ/F77L6GZIWMFD6IJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F10/D0PR/IWMFD5I7/F10D0PRIWMFD5I7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRV/8TNS/IWMFD6JN/FRV8TNSIWMFD6JN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4K/NASG/IWMFD5O4/F4KNASGIWMFD5O4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLY/9EY5/IWMFD5QK/FLY9EY5IWMFD5QK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIQ/KZTO/IWMFD604/FIQKZTOIWMFD604.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4S/51X6/IWMFD5ST/F4S51X6IWMFD5ST.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRI/BRMI/IWMFD6OO/FRIBRMIIWMFD6OO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJS/AYXT/IWMFD6PB/FJSAYXTIWMFD6PB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBK/01QQ/IWMFD6PQ/FBK01QQIWMFD6PQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJH/U754/IWMFD72E/FJHU754IWMFD72E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F83/WLRK/IWMFD6QQ/F83WLRKIWMFD6QQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Making a Base"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "The top of the wood base will be frosted plastic that is lit from underneath so that you have a bright surface on which to put your stained glass tiles. Before you glued the plywood into your frame, you should have traced the inside of the frame onto the plastic that you will be using. I had a 42\" LED TV that someone had thrown away which I tore apart for parts. Between the backlight and LCD, there is a thin but rigid piece of frosted plastic that was perfect for this purpose.\nThis plastic was a bit brittle, so it was difficult to cut without cracking it. I made two different bases about a week apart, and after the first time didn't go as well as I would like, I tried a different method. For the first base, I used my rotary tool with a cutting wheel. This did not work very well, because rather than cutting through the plastic, it kind of just melted it. It did get the job done, though, and I think if I had better cutting wheels, it would have worked a little better. The second method I tried was very similar to cutting glass. I used a utility knife to start a controlled crack through the plastic, then gently broke it apart along that crack. This ended up looking better than when I used the rotary tool, but required a lot more care, and I still had a few stray cracks that I had to seal up with superglue.\nBefore you put the plastic in place, you need to mount your lights and put supports in place to hold up the plastic.\nI had some 12 V LED strips that I wasn't using any longer that worked great for the lighting. I mounted a female barrel jack (2.1 x 5.5 mm) adaptor (with wires already connected) in the hole drilled in the last step and secured it with lots of hot glue (I'm sure there are better methods, but that's what I had at the time). Then, I strung the LED around the edge of the frame so that the LED's point toward the center of the base (not up). By doing this, I hoped to achieve more even lighting without bright spots, and it seemed to work pretty well.\nTo hold up the plastic piece, I cut up a 1/2\" wooden dowel that I had laying around into 2\" lengths. Then, I glued them (using the same hot glue-wood glue combination) to the plywood that forms the bottom of the base. My arrangement was pretty much random, and as long as they are more-or-less evenly distributed, it should work well. Once the glue dries, put the plastic on top.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHB/5NWY/IWMFD6KB/FHB5NWYIWMFD6KB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ2/PS8X/IWMFD6SD/FQ2PS8XIWMFD6SD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFG/TVQ6/IWMFD6V0/FFGTVQ6IWMFD6V0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7B/L272/IWMFD6Z3/F7BL272IWMFD6Z3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHE/O6R6/IWMFD6ZP/FHEO6R6IWMFD6ZP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWU/N3N9/IWMFD71T/FWUN3N9IWMFD71T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWG/44N6/IWMFD714/FWG44N6IWMFD714.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM4/9G3N/IWMFD705/FM49G3NIWMFD705.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI3/DGU3/IWMFD740/FI3DGU3IWMFD740.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5P/S7BP/IWMFD73U/F5PS7BPIWMFD73U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9C/0HUD/IWMFD769/F9C0HUDIWMFD769.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKR/PXAF/IWMFD76V/FKRPXAFIWMFD76V.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Light It Up!"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "For the most part, you want to be displaying a work of art such as this, but for the rare occasions when you need to store it, you want something safe so that the glass tiles do not break.

A capture can only occur if you add the pips (dots on dice) on the dice that are being captured and they add up to 6 or less.

If you are playing your piece on a white space, you can only capture from the 4 (or less) adjacent colored spaces. If you capture by placing your piece on a colored space, you can only capture from the adjacent white spaces.\n\nNon-capturing move: all non-capturing moves can be played in any empty space on the board.

The playfield is purely custom, but the shot lines (such as the curve of the back looping shot) were designed based on real pinball machines to ensure smooth play. One difficulty here is that, due to their complexity, the actual pinball parts (e.g. the bumpers and the drop targets) were not modeled, but care still has to be taken to ensure that everything will fit underneath the playfield - the parts are much larger underneath than above.\nThe files are included in the repository, so feel free to adjust the design to suit your fancy.\nA few highlights of the design:\nThe playfield is 42\u201d by 20.25\u201d inches, exactly the size of 1980\u2019s Bally-style games. It is made of \u00bd\u201d plywood, which is standard and should not be changed as the pinball part assemblies are designed for this thickness. The walls here consist of a \u00bd\u201d layer on top of a \u00bc\u201d layer. In the first prototype, only \u00bd\u201d walls were included, but these proved to be too short and could pop the pinball into the air on particularly firm shots. Secondly, this design allows for slightly raised shooter line (pictured above) which allows the ball to drop slightly into the playfield, but not fall back in.\nThe ramp is designed with clear acrylic and 3d-printed supports. It crosses the playfield so that it gives the player the opportunity to hit the ramp multiple times in a row from the left flipper. As such, clear acrylic is used to not obstruct the player\u2019s view of the table:\nFinally, the playfield is supported by short walls at the four corners, which keep the playfield at the standard 6.5 degrees of slope. The back wall has a bottom \u201cshelf\u201d that can be removed and is used to mount the electronics. This results in a game with a full-size playfield, but is much more compact than a typical game and can be carried by hand by one person. Since the playfield is a standard size, however, these supports can be removed if you want to place the playfield into a standard pinball cabinet. To do so, you may want to consider adding a ball return assembly, which is not included in this design.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FI3/VWFO/IWMR25UO/FI3VWFOIWMR25UO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ9/4Z4A/IWMR25X6/FJ94Z4AIWMR25X6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8D/Y85N/IWMR25VK/F8DY85NIWMR25VK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Design"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "To cut the layers of the playfield, we used a laser cutter. However, a laser cutter powerful enough to cut \u00bd\u201d plywood is hard to find, requires high-quality plywood, and can risk starting a fire if you\u2019re not careful. Typical playfields are cut using a CNC router - while some of the corners might not be as crisp, you should still achieve decent results. For simplicity, the steps below will assume you have access to the same laser cutter we did. There are some people who have had decent results using only a drill and jigsaw, but you must be very careful and very patient if you go this route.\nThe first step in creating the playfield is converting the design into .DXF files that can be fed into a laser cutter. For example, the playfield .DXF file is pictured below. The files used in this project are included in our repository.\nUsing the laser cutter, we cut out shapes for the playfield, the \u00bc\u201d intermediate layer (we used duron, a cheaper wood-like prototyping material, but \u00bc\u201d plywood will also work), the \u00bd\u201d top layer, and the \u00bd\u201d supports.\nMaterials needed:\n\u00bd\u201d plywood for the playfield and base\n\u00bc\u201d plywood or duron for the intermediate wall layer\n\u00bd\u201d, \u00be\u201d, and 1\u201d wood screws\nAccess to a CNC router or laser cutter", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCS/E80C/IWMR25VH/FCSE80CIWMR25VH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNQ/DE1O/IWMR25U2/FNQDE1OIWMR25U2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Cut the Wood"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Begin by clamping the pieces from the \u00bc\u201d duron layer onto the plywood in their respective locations. Using a hand-drill, first drill pilot holes using a 3/32\u201d bit, and then use flat-head \u00be\u201d wood screws to attach the \u00bc\u201d layer to the playfield It is important to do this from the top-down (i.e. so that the screw first goes through the \u00bc\u201d layer, then into the \u00bd\u201d base), since the \u00bc\u201d parts are small and thin and will bend away from the base layer if drilled in the opposite direction. It is also important to make sure the screw heads are flush with the \u00bc\u201d layer and don\u2019t provide any additional thickness.\nOne final note: these screws can go almost anywhere, as this layer will be mostly invisible to the player once the playfield is assembled. But there is an exception -- don\u2019t put screws into the shooter lane. (We initially made this mistake).\nNext, attach the side walls, and use the longest wood screws to drill into them from the top of the board, again such that the screw heads are flush with the top. Once that is done, clamp the \u00bd\u201d layer pieces on top of the duron, and screw them in as before, except this time screwing in from the bottom using 1\" screws. Since the top layer is \u00bd\u201d thick, it is less likely to bend away from the base, and screwing from the bottom ensures that the screws stay invisible to the player.\nFinally, attach the shooter block (pictured above, with shooter) by screwing in from the bottom side using 2 screws so the block cannot easily twist. The shooter block has a \"U\"-shaped slot that fits the shooter, which can be installed by tightening the nut on the other side. You may also have to use lubricant to reduce the friction between the shooting rod and the ball.\nThe design may need some adjustments at this point. For example, in our design, the cut for the drop targets was too narrow and had to be expanded using a dremel. If using our files as more than a reference, do try to contact the authors who might be able to provide updated files. It is also a good idea to sand down any rough areas, particurarily where two wood pieces meet.\nFor the most part, this concludes the woodworking, and we can move to putting in components.\nMaterials needed:\n3/4\" flat head wood screws\nShooter assembly\nLonger (~1.5\") wood screws\nHand drill with 3/32\" bit\nLubricating oil\n1\" flat head wood screws\nA file and/or dremel, and sandpaper", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCV/5KA3/IWMR25W1/FCV5KA3IWMR25W1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ4/PHPV/IWMR25V7/FZ4PHPVIWMR25V7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCK/2B45/IWQUU19I/FCK2B45IWQUU19I.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Assemble the Playfield"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "By this point in the design stage, you should have a general idea of the orientation required to make sure all the components actually fit underneath the playfield. (If using our design, reference the picture of the underside of our table above).\nFirst, install the drop targets, stand-up target, and slingshot assemblies by putting \u00bd\u201d wood screws through the mounting holes in the assembly. Do the same with the pop bumpers, but make sure to remove the cap first, or the assembly won\u2019t fit into its hole!\nSecond, install the flipper assemblies. Make sure that they rotate in the correct direction. The solenoid, when fired, will pill the pin into the coil, and this should rotate the shaft such that the flipper rotates up towards the playfield. Once the flipper assemblies are installed, attach the flipper bats in from the other side. Use a wrench on the lock nut in the assembly to tighten them into place, then use the spring that should come with the assembly to make sure the flippers are bulled back down when not being fired.\nSimilarly, install all the rollover switches using the 1/2\" screws, ensuring that they can be easily pressed in from the top and spring back into place. Using the 6-32 bolts, also attach the gate switch at the top-left of our design. This gate switch also serves as a one-way opening, which allows shots from the right side and from the shooter to fall into the bumpers. This is a design aspect that results in shots entering the right ramp and right loop going to different places and adds more variety to the play.\nTo install the lights, first place the plastic inserts into their holes. These inserts are about \u00bc\u201d thick. If using a CNC router, the proper way to mount these is to cut a \u00bc\u201d layer slightly larger than the insert hole. In our design, since the laser cutter cannot cut partial layers, we 3D-printed brackets that support the inserts. Use epoxy to hold the inserts into place (roughen the edges first) and the sandpaper to make sure the inserts are level with the playfield.\nNext, insert the LEDS into their brackets by inserting and twisting them into place. Then, screw the brackets into place such that these LEDs sit directly below each insert. The light brackets linked below are pretty thin, and actually thin enough that the 1/2\" screws may pierce the top of the table. Use a couple of washers so that this doesn't happen.\nThe playfield posts are installed using the 6-32 bolts. Once installed, wrap rubbers from the rubber kit around them to make passive bumpers. These give the table a lot more \u201clife\u201d than if the design were to be completely plywood. Using the same bolts, attach the lane guides just above the flippers. Also glue the end-of-game switch into place.\nNote that most games have a dedicated ball return assembly like the one here. This was not included in this design, however, primarily due to cost. The trade-off, of course, is that the player is now responsible for placing the ball back into the shooter lane once it drains. We do have a shooter, though, which is attached to the shooter block as pictured earlier.\nThe flipper buttons and start button are installed by placing them into the holes and locking into place with palnuts. The flipper button leaf switches are bolted inside the buttons using 6-32 bolts and will close a switch circuit when the buttons are pressed.\nAt this point, your playfield will (from above) resemble a nearly-complete pinball table! All that is missing is the ramp. Feel free to gloat among your friends about how awesome it looks while privately being frightened about how much wiring and soldering there is to do.\nMaterials needed (the majority were purchased from PinballLife.com, and can be found simply by searching the terms below).\n1 3-bank drop target assembly\n3x pop bumper assembly\n1 left flipper assembly\n1 right flipper assembly\n2 flipper bats\n2 flipper buttons\n2 flipper button palnuts\n1 start button\n1 rubber ring set\n~30 playfield star posts, (1 1/16\" used)\n2 lane guides\n2 flipper button leaf switches\n2 slingshot assemblies\n1 standup target\n10 rollover switches\n8 LED #44 bayonet-style lights\n8 bayonet-style light brackets (Miniature Bayonet Base 2-Lead Socket With Long Mounting Bracket)\n5 1-1/2\" x 13/16\" blue arrow insert\n3 1\" x 3/4\" clear bullet insert\n6-32 bolts (2.5\", as well as some smaller sizes), nuts, and washers\n~2\" wide gate switch (like the one here, this may be hard to find, we scrapped ours from an old broken pinball ramp purchased on ebay)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8B/26SO/IWQUUAJ6/F8B26SOIWQUUAJ6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ1/B5K5/IWMR25VT/FQ1B5K5IWMR25VT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVZ/YEZU/IWMR25VD/FVZYEZUIWMR25VD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCE/604F/IWMR25Y9/FCE604FIWMR25Y9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG8/QY30/IWMR25W6/FG8QY30IWMR25W6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3N/LME4/IWMR25UF/F3NLME4IWMR25UF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG7/FVYA/IWMR25V3/FG7FVYAIWMR25V3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFZ/OR47/IWQUU9R2/FFZOR47IWQUU9R2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Add the Components"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "To make the ramp, use \u00bc\u201d acrylic for the base pieces and \u215b\u201d acrylic for the side walls. The clear acrylic will give a nice, clean appearance while not blocking the view of the playfield for the player. Using colored acrylic might also be a nice-looking option, but it is not recommended to use a completely opaque material like wood.\nThe supports for the ramps are 3D printed using a makerbot and bolted to the playfield and the plastic using the same 6-32 bolts.\nThe acrylic pieces here are glued together using acrylic cement, which is a solvent that essentially melts and welds the plastic together. Make sure to use a small amount, and it will make a very strong bond that is almost invisible.\nAt the entrance of the ramp, we have included a ramp flap like the one in the picture above. This is a thin piece of metal that gives a very smooth transition from the playfield to the plastic of the ramp, rather than having the pinball have to \u201cjump\u201d up the \u00bc\u201d thickness of the plastic. You can buy one of these cheaply from a pinball specialty store or Ebay (we did), or just make one of your own out of sheet metal. In commercial games, these are riveted so that the bolts do not stick up and get in the way of the ball. Since we did not have the proper equipment to do that, we made sure to use flat-head screws and properly chamfer out a hole in the plastic and in the metal to achieve the same effect.\nThere is a narrow gate switch attached to the 3D supports on the front-right corner of the ramp, where it turns to go across the playfield.

I'd recommend using 35V or lower with these electronics, or using a more professional control board resource like the ones listed here: http://pinballmakers.com/wiki/index.php/Construction)\nThis machine has 3 voltage levels: 48V for the solenoid power, 6.3V for the LEDs, and 5V for the logic and sound. To provide these voltage levels, we used a CNC power supply for the 48V, and off-the-shelf DC adapters to provide the 6.3V and the 5V. (It could be possible to just use the 6.3V, as the Arduino down-regulates its supply voltage to its 5V output pin, but we kept those power supplies isolated). 48V is a high voltage, and while not deadly by itself can be damaging to parts and can quickly cause components to overheat if there are any problems with the circuitry. Use a 5-A slow-blow fuse on both the input and the output of the main 48V power supply to avoid starting a fire if any of the transistors short.\nOn the Arduino shield, we attached wires with female Molex connectors designed that matched the input and output requirements of each of the three sub-boards: the solenoid driver board, the lights/sound driver board, and the input board.\nIn our design, we had the following pin assignments.

Since the signals are at the 5V level and the solenoids at 48V, hefty power MOSFETS are necessary to relay the signal. The transistors used in this design are these 100V-rated MOSFETs from Mouser.\nThere are three schematics pictured above, which includes the flippers, the slingshots, and the bumpers/drop targets. Each has slightly different requirements, but in all of them, when the transistor is given a 5V signal, a current path opens for the solenoid and 5-8 amps are pushed through the coil to give a powerful kick. This is a lot of current! In fact, this much current will burn out the components if the transistor is kept on for more than a very brief pulse. Make sure, in testing this circuit using software or other methods, to never fully power a solenoid for more than about a second.\nThe main source of problems in the above circuitry is inductive kick. The solenoids are powerful inductors, and as you may know, the current in inductors cannot change instantaneously. As such, when the transistor is turned-off, there is still a brief moment where 5-8 amps is flowing through the solenoid, and all that current needs somewhere to go. If not given a path to ground, this current will drive the voltage at the transistor drain up to hundreds of volts and destroy the transistor. Furthermore, when the transistor is destroyed, it shorts all three terminals, which causes amps of continuous current to flow and can destroy the solenoid if there isn\u2019t a proper fuse installed. (We destroyed 8 transistors in our discovery and attempts to deal with this problem, but fortunately no solenoids since we were always quick to manually disconnect the power).\nThere are two methods to prevent inductive kick: first, each pinball assembly should come with a diode that points from the transistor drain back up to the supply. This, in theory, should prevent the transistor drain from ever exceeding the supply voltage, as once that happens the diode will turn on and drain all the remaining energy from the inductor. Unfortunately, in reality these diodes alone do not turn on fast enough to suppress the inductive kick enough by themselves.\nTo solve the problem, we added an RC \u2018snubber\u2019 circuit. This circuit features a capacitor in series with a resistor. The capacitor absorbs enough current from the inductor such that the diode has time to turn on and perform its function. For more info on RC snubber circuits, check here.\nThe bumper/droptarget solenoid driver circuit is fairly simple and has just the transistor, the solenoid, the snubber, and a connection to receive the input from the Arduino. In this board and subsequent boards, make sure to wire the solenoid such that the diode (which is not shown in the schematic) points towards the high voltage side.\nThe flipper driver circuit is a bit more complicated for three reasons. First, in order to have a fast reaction between the button press and the flipper action, it is recommended to create that response directly in the circuitry rather than as separate inputs and outputs handled by the Arduino. The delay caused by the Arduino is small, but an experienced player will be able to tell immediately and will be frustrated by the lack of control.\nSecondly, the flippers feature two different coils (a low-power and a high-power coil) an end-of-stroke switch which triggers when the flipper is high. This switch serves the important function of allowing the high power coil to fire initially to give a powerful stroke, but switching to the low power coil (~130 ohms vs. 4 ohms) that gives enough power to keep the flipper held \u2018up\u2019 as long as the button is placed, but does not draw so much current as to burn out the solenoid. In the picture below, the EOS switch is normally closed, but our assembly had a normally-open switch and necessitated another transistor to convert that into a normally-closed signal.\nThirdly, while we wanted the button to control the flippers directly, we also included a \u2018master\u2019 switch signal from the Arduino that could activate or deactivate the flippers depending on whether the ball was in play. This results in the use of the third transistor in the circuit.\nSimilarly, the slingshot board has its own complications. While it uses just one transistor, it, like the flippers, should be controlled directly by the input switches (which we wired in series) for a fast response as well as to not require additional output pins on the Arduino. Unfortunately, if the gate of the transistor is connected to the switch directly, the response is far too fast to have more than a barely-noticeable kick since the switch does not stay closed for very long. In order to have a more powerful kick (i.e. letting the slingshot solenoid \"follow through\"), we added a diode and a large resistor at the gate of the transistors, which allows for a quick response but creates a large time constant of voltage decay at that node so that the gate remains close to 5V (and the transistor on) long enough to have a noticeable kick, even after the slingshot switches have been re-opened. Another complication is sending this input to the Arduino, as the input board (as we will see later) requires low inputs, and the slingshot operates when an input is pushed high. To solve this problem, we included a third transistor that closes whenever either input goes high, and thus can be treated like any other input switch on the playfield\nThe driver board (actually two boards) consists of two flipper drivers, two slingshot drivers, and four single-switch drivers for the remaining solenoids. Rather than soldering directly, we used 0.1\u201d molex connectors to attach this board to the solenoids, power supply, and switches, so that any repairs or adjustments could be more easily made.\nWe used solderable breadboards for our designs, but designing actual PCBs with these functions would have a much cleaner result and help mitigate the mess of wires that these machines inevitably have.\nMaterials:\n12 100V-rated power transistors\n10-50 uF capacitors (nonpolar if possible)\n300, 5k, and 500k, and 3M resistors\n1 smaller transistor for slingshot switch\nSeveral 1N4004 diodes\nPrototype solderable breadboards (or, even better, design your own PCBs)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FK5/RSWS/IWMR23I3/FK5RSWSIWMR23I3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYK/XVI8/IWMR23MB/FYKXVI8IWMR23MB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQW/4HV3/IWMR23NZ/FQW4HV3IWMR23NZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBS/FMWV/IWMR2ACI/FBSFMWVIWMR2ACI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB0/ZYDF/IWMR25U7/FB0ZYDFIWMR25U7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYA/R2J6/IWMR23ID/FYAR2J6IWMR23ID.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUH/4WNV/IWQUUISU/FUH4WNVIWQUUISU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Make the Driver Boards"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Since we are using just an Arduino, we are limited to 20 digital pins. The pinball machine, however, has a few dozen unique switch inputs, not to mention outputs needed for lights, sound, and driving solenoids. To alleviate this problem, we made the assumption that no two inputs would be triggered at once (thereby limiting us to only using 1 ball). This assumption allows us to \u2018encode\u2019 the switch inputs by converting them into a 5-bit binary register with a 6th pin that triggered an interrupt whenever a valid switch input was received. To accomplish this, we used a cascade of 8-to-3 encoders to make a 24-to-5 encoder using this encoder in the layout shown in the pictures above.\nThis was one of the most important developments of the project, as it allowed us to greatly increase the complexity of our machine from our initial plan of just having flippers, bumpers, and one or two targets.\nA second prototype board was used to place each of the 24 male Molex connectors; each switch on the playfield would have a female connector at the end of a long wire that plugs into this board. The drop targets are a unique case that can be handled in several ways. What we did was wire each drop target switch in series, so that the input is closed when they are all down and allows the Arduino to send a signal to the solenoid to fire the drop targets back up.\nMaterials:\n4 3-state-output priority 8-to-3 encoders", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFD/TJQ9/IWMR25VG/FFDTJQ9IWMR25VG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGU/R213/IWMR23MZ/FGUR213IWMR23MZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Make the Sensor Input Board"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "To save pins in a similar manner to the encoder, we used a 3-to-8 decoder to control our lights. This provided us with the limitation that we could not light more than one light at any one time, but that was an acceptable tradeoff to free up the pins for other elements. We also included a 4th \u201cmaster\u201d light output that could control all of the lights at once. This, for example, could allow us to flash all the lights several times when the game is first turned on (giving a strong indication that something is actually happening to the player when he or she presses the start button, which is otherwise difficult without a ball trough or colorful display).\nThe above schematic features a transistor circuit similar to the drivers, but much simpler as the lower voltages in play (6.3V for the lights) need smaller transistors and do not necessitate as much protection circuitry. We used a diode OR gate for the transistors to isolate the master switch signal and the individual light signal. This allows us to use only one transistor per light instead of two, and prevents the Arduino and the encoder chips from \u2018fighting\u2019 to source or sink current.\nWhile we used low-current LEDs for each of the playfield lights (the ones underneath inserts), the start button and the 3 pop bumpers each came with incandescent bulbs that draw about 250mA each. The transistors are rated for 530mA of continuous current, so to not exceed this, we made sure that only two incandescent ever went through a single transistor.\nWe also attached a passive 5V piezo buzzer that allows us to play rudimentary sounds to this board.\nCustom light and sound sequences can be programmed using functions light_sequence + sound_sequence or through the Pinball Language interface.\n10 lighting transistors (we used these)\n5V Piezo buzzer", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FA2/IDDU/IWMR2ACJ/FA2IDDUIWMR2ACJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGN/X1MC/IWMR23LP/FGNX1MCIWMR23LP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Make the Light/sound/score Peripheral Board"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "There are two options for defining the rules of the pinball game.

This could be because the customizable game had a lot of general-purpose functions which required conditional statements. This slowed down the read speed of the loop, which caused us to miss several interrupts and affected the overall operating speed of the game. To solve this problem, we reduced some of the customizability of the config file game in order to achieve acceptable response times in the circuit. We originally had concerns about the RAM capacity of the Arduino and how much of the game rules it could store, but this turned out to be less of a problem than originally expected and it was the speed of the loop that was the bigger limiting factor.\nDebouncing interrupts - because of the quick actions of the pinball game, we had several cases during which the interrupt pin was receiving several interrupts for the pinball hitting only one game component. Additionally, because these interrupts were received before the encoder had time to correctly read all inputs, the interrupts would be linked to incorrect components. To solve this problem, we used an external debouncing library which responds 1ms after the first interrupt is received, giving time for the encoder pins to reach high before the game reads the input code.\nDisplay - Although serial display allows for the game to print out detailed messages, it\u2019s hard for a player to read the output messages when playing a fast-paced game of pinball. It\u2019s also unwieldy for the player to have to play the game with a computer attached.

There are a lot of wires, so be careful! Follow the layout given in Electronic Pins and Layout to connect your Arduino outlets to their corresponding pins. Molex connectors should help a lot in figuring out which connectors connect with which.\nHere is a short troubleshooting FAQ in case you run into any of the common problems we did:\nNone of the inputs are being recorded by the Arduino!\nThe nature of the input encoder is that there are 6 input pins into the Arduino: 5 which together show which input is triggered, and a 6th pin that goes high if any single input is triggered. The code written only detects when this sixth pin changes from low to high. So if the Arduino is not receiving any inputs, and you are sure that all or at least most of the switches work, check to see if any switches are stuck closed. For example, if all the drop targets are down and haven't been fired back up, that is a closed switch and prevents the Arduino from receiving any other inputs.\nThe shooter is really weak!\nCheck to sure that the nut that holds the shooter in place is tightened fully, or that the shooter block isn't loose. Alternatively, oil the shooter rod.\nCertain inputs, like rollovers, aren't always being recorded\nThis can be a mechanical/design problem if the switches are placed in too wide a lane, allowing the ball to go 'around' them. Otherwise, it can be the result of too long of a delay somewhere in the code. If, for example, you are busy playing a tone using the tone library and a delay() statement, the Arduino will not be able to pick up inputs during that time. One workaround we used was to only play sounds for the ramp shot, standup target, start button, and end-of-game switch, as we knew about how much time we would have after these shots before a new input was likely to be triggered.\nThe wrong bumper fires when the ball is switched! OR The wrong lights go on!\nAdmittedly, we did not assign specific headers for specific lights or specific solenoids, meaning that the first time you plug everything in (or subsequent times if you don't label them somehow), the output pins (or output light encoding) are connected in arbitrary order. Use trial-and-error to resolve which pins correspond to which output and adjust the code accordingly. For the lights and bumpers, this isn't so bad -- but definitely label all the inputs and write down which is which, as that process can have up to 24 values and will take a bit longer to calibrate.\nThe inputs are fine when I press them, but sometimes are wrong during play?\nThe encoder has the unfortunate property of sometimes pulsing the indicator pin high before the 5 encoder pins have fully resolved their values. For us, we knew this had occurred when the number of the switch being pressed was off-by-one, but it may show up differently for you. We solved this problem by using a debouncing library to create a tiny bit of delay between when we notice that a switched has changed and when we record which switch it was. Careful, though, as too much of a delay (more than 15-20mS) can cause you to miss inputs entirely.\nThere are so so many wires and I can't keep them all organized please help\nSorry, but we haven't really figured out a good solution for this one yet.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLZ/RYJ0/IWQUUQG5/FLZRYJ0IWQUUQG5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJF/T222/IWMR0VAK/FJFT222IWMR0VAK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 15: Connect Everything"}], "channel": "Table Top"}, {"category": "Play", "description": "Hey, this is an EASY way to do something awesome and impressive;)", "title": "How to Throw a Playing Card Like a Pro", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Throw-a-Playing-Card-Like-a-Pro/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Super simple.

This part definitely took me awhile, but as many of you already know looming can be very time consuming. If you don't know how to do a fish tail pattern I recommend you look it up as there are way better teachers then me on the subject but I will do my best to explain it here. Follow the pictures above as you read the steps. First string a band across your two pencils or mini loom kit and twist it so the band makes an X . Next simply loop 2 bands onto your mini loom or pencils. Now that you have three bands on, take the bottom band and bring the right end up and over the other two bands and into the middle. Do the same thing with the left side. Now add on another band and repeat the last two steps until you have a 25 band long string. Eventually you'll get down to the last bit and can't continue the pattern because if you put on another band you'll have 26.

To finish your string take the bottom of the two bands and loop them over the top one like you did earlier. now you should have only one band stretched out. Now its time for your S or C clips. Take one end of the stretched rubber band and put it into your clip. Take the band off the pencil and clip the other end of the rubber band so both ends are on one side of your C or S clip. Thats it!

It has a playing field and when a ball falls through the holes, the ball rolls down a return floor, out into a basket.\nI drew my basic plan on a piece of paper, eventually transferring my sketches onto a full size draft on cardboard. In my game, you pitch the ball with the plunger, then hit the ball with the single flipper. If the ball is \u201ccaught\u201d by a fielder, the player records an out. Otherwise, the ball falls in a hole and counts as a run. You play until you record 27 (or whatever amount you wish) outs, just like in real baseball.\nMake sure you account for the plunger in your design. The playing field will have the plunger attached to the left or right wall.\n2. Draw a finalized plan on a large piece of cardboard.

I also trimmed the tops of my sides down so the tops were always 2\u201d above the playing field.\n2. Hot glue the sides onto the playing field. I have a technique for creating strong, sturdy butt joints like you see throughout this project. First, make three large dabs on the thin edge of one board, then press and wait to cool. Once cooled, I lay a bead in the resultant corner. This is a very similar technique to welding metal plates together with MIG welder.\nClose Up of Hot Gluing a Weld in Cardboard\n3.

The original had pieces that were actually X and O shaped beads. This was not something I was willing to try for. The last time I made one of these, I used large wooden beads as the markers--but I could not find them this time. I did find some wooden blocks (from teaching volume in geometry class) and some dowel rods. It actually took longer to find the supplies than it did to make the game.\nThe game is simple enough for a 6 year old and challenging enough for teens and adults.

I originally created these back in October 2016 for components of my Halloween LEGO photo display. The design and electrical portion were ultimately created as a result of trial and error, and made to be as simple and minimalist as possible. If followed accordingly, each candle contains 29 LEGO pieces, one LED, one battery, and a few wires. This project requires some soldering, but substitutions can be made where applicable.\nLike the rest of my other LEGO projects, you're free to deviate from the design and use your own colors/pieces. In this model, the candle itself is white, with a dark grey candlestick, and a flickering LED. You can do such things as making the candles different colors, re-designing the candlestick, or even omitting the flickering function for a simple standard glowing LED. You could also use this basic tutorial as a mere suggestion for making a completely different candle concept, such as a small round votive candle made from LEGO bricks.", "title": "Illuminated Electronic LEGO LED Candles", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Illuminated-Electronic-LEGO-LED-Candles/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The candle only requires 29 common LEGO pieces, if using my design verbatim.

I think I bought mine from Party City for cheaper, since they were sold alongside illuminated Halloween costume components. Any 3V button cell can be substituted, so long as it's small enough to fit in the bottom of the candlestick holder.\nMicro toggle slide switch ($1.49 USD). I bought mine from the Tinkersphere store in New York City, but you can get this specific part from the previous URL. You can probably find similar ones from Radio Shack or eBay. The key is that it has to be a small toggle switch, and not a momentary switch.\nFlickering LED: I used 5mm LEDs at the for this model, since they're the only ones I had in my toolkit at the time of production, but 3mm LEDs would be a better fit. If using 5mm LEDs, the sides of the LED bulb must be clipped with scissors or sanded down, so that they can fit within the LEGO pieces. 3mm LEDs fit easily within the LEGO brick for the flame. Flickering LEDs are somewhat difficult to find in stores, so any regular white or yellow LED can suffice, if you want to forego the flickering effect for a standard glow.\n26-30 AWG wire, preferably two different colors to distinguish positive from ground connections. I always use red and black wires for building circuits.\nSoldering iron\nSolder\nElectrical tape\nNeedlenose pliers\nDue to the nature of the button cell, no resistors are needed, and they are wired directly to the switch and LED.\nUsing wire cutters, cut a ~9.5cm (7.67 inches) strip of black wire and strip both ends.\nCut two strips of red wire: ~16.5cm (6.49 inches) and ~3cm (1.18 inches), and strip both ends of both pieces.\nSolder the red wire to the anode (long leg) of the LED.\nSolder the longer black wire to the cathode (short leg) of the LED.\nTape a small strip of electrical tape around either the anode or cathode solder connection: this is done strictly to prevent the anode and cathode from making contact. If both wires connect while the candle is powered, it'll create a short circuit. Also adding a small strip of tape around the connection will help keep the wires inside the candle tube.\nPlace the transparent orange LEGO \"flame\" piece over top of the LED.\nSlide the two long wires down the inside of the white candle tube (consisting of 14 round white bricks).\nWith the red and black wires hanging out of the end of the white candle tube, attach the candle to the candlestick. The black wire should go all of the way through the grey candlestick holder and coming out from the end.\nThe red wire should poke through the small gap in the four 1x1 round bricks. The 4th brick -- a 1x1 cone -- is there since it creates a gap for the smaller red wire to poke through. You can disassemble parts of the candlestick base to allow the red wire to come through the tiny clearance, and then rebuild the base around the wires.\nSlide the smaller red wire through the bottom gap of the 1x1 round bricks, and allow it to come out through the bottom of the candlestick. As with the step above, you can disassemble pieces of the base and rebuild the base around the wires.\nThe black wire and the small red wire should be flush without about half an inch of slack coming out of the bottom of the candlestick holder.\nIf using the same slide switch as I purchased, clip off one of the left or right pins, so that only two pins come from the switch. Solder one pin to the 1st red wire and the other pin to the 2nd red wire.\nCarefully tape the button cell to the wires at the bottom, making sure to have proper polarity. The top of the battery -- the smooth side with the text -- is the positive (+) connection, and the bottom side with the textured surface is the negative/ground (-) connection. I usually start by laying out a small strip of electrical tape, then I place the black wire stripped end to the tape flat. I placed the bottom of the battery over the top of stripped wire, then I placed the stripped red wire over top of the battery. Carefully I wrapped the tape around the battery and two wire connections. NOTE: I had trouble keeping the stripped wired ends taped to the battery, so I soldered two small metal pieces at the ends of the wires. The metal strips were clipped off male wire spade connectors.\nFlick the switch to test the connection. If the LED does not glow, it means you have a faulty connection, a dead battery, or most likely the battery wrapping wasn't done tightly. With the switch still on, squeeze down on the wrapped battery to see if any light comes from the top of the candle. If the LED glows brightly as you squeeze down on the wrapped battery, it means you need to wrap it tighter. Sometimes this tightness issue gets resolved when you cram the wrapped battery into the bottom chamber of the candlestick base.\nIf functioning properly, carefully attach the bottom to the candlestick holder.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6V/1SSK/IWH3GC9D/F6V1SSKIWH3GC9D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHJ/AF08/IWH3GC9E/FHJAF08IWH3GC9E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFM/WGX7/IWH3GGFO/FFMWGX7IWH3GGFO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8K/DSE6/IWH3GGEG/F8KDSE6IWH3GGEG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPZ/E6XH/IWH3GGOS/FPZE6XHIWH3GGOS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0F/PV00/IWH3GGM6/F0FPV00IWH3GGM6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUK/UKRN/IWH3GGJC/FUKUKRNIWH3GGJC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDJ/9K55/IWH3GGD7/FDJ9K55IWH3GGD7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSB/07RY/IWH3GGHJ/FSB07RYIWH3GGHJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPA/OB5A/IWH3GH6Q/FPAOB5AIWH3GH6Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB5/R0TO/IWH3GH7X/FB5R0TOIWH3GH7X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMP/X394/IWH3GHCQ/FMPX394IWH3GHCQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS4/4TOI/IWH3GGRN/FS44TOIIWH3GGRN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAU/0E73/IWH3GGSG/FAU0E73IWH3GGSG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSN/5KZN/IWH3GGSH/FSN5KZNIWH3GGSH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRD/KN0O/IWH3GH23/FRDKN0OIWH3GH23.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE8/C5QT/IWH3GGYJ/FE8C5QTIWH3GGYJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLO/H7SK/IWH3GGW1/FLOH7SKIWH3GGW1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY8/UHHQ/IWH3GGVD/FY8UHHQIWH3GGVD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWY/V56R/IWH3GGVC/FWYV56RIWH3GGVC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Assembling the Electronic Innards"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "With any luck, your candle should be glowing and flickering like a champ. As mentioned in the previous step, here are some troubleshooting methods to try if the light won't go on, or if the LED is too dim:\nBefore connecting all of the electronic parts together, test out the LED, switch, and battery individually on a breadboard or with a voltmeter to see if they're functioning.\nWhen taping the battery to the wires, make sure it's wrapped tightly, and that the red and black wires don't touch each other. The red wire should touch only the top (shiny part) of the battery, and the black wire should only touch the bottom (textured part) of the battery. If the electrical tape wrapping isn't tight enough, the connections will come loose. Sometimes if the connections are loose, this can be resolved by cramming the wrapped battery inside the bottom of the candlestick holder, which securely keeps the whole wrap in place.\nMake sure the proper polarity is used for the LED: red wire to anode (long pin) and black wire to cathode (shorter pin). The anode and cathode should never touch, as this creates a short circuit -- hence why I recommend wrapping a small piece of tape around either one of the LED's pins after soldering.\n-Baron von Brunk\nCredits: photography and video recording by Julius von Brunk", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJT/WKIA/IWH3H8LZ/FJTWKIAIWH3H8LZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMS/0ZSM/IWH3H4QT/FMS0ZSMIWH3H4QT.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F77/XEOD/IWH3GXEF/F77XEODIWH3GXEF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB3/SD42/IWH3GXEQ/FB3SD42IWH3GXEQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Fire Fire FIRE!!!"}], "channel": "LEGO"}, {"category": "Play", "description": "Hi All,\n\nMy son loves paper planes and he spends good amount of time making alot of planes\n\nIn this instructable I will share how to mage a simple paper plane launcher, from old toy car motor and wheels\n\nPlease check out the video for demo\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=wGJwAuCnpQY", "title": "Paper Plane Launcher", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Paper-Plane-Launcher-2/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Material\n- Two motors from old toy car\n- Two wheels\n- Two AA batteries and holder\n- WOODEN STRIPS for frame\n- Double side tape\n- 1mm thick foam sheet\n- Acrylic paint\n- Fevicol\n- Paper for planes\n\nTools\n- Nails\n- Hammer\n- Hexsaw\n- Paper tape", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSK/7U5R/IWH3FGHQ/FSK7U5RIWH3FGHQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKA/4BOK/IWH3FGI3/FKA4BOKIWH3FGI3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMH/TAMW/IWH3FGIF/FMHTAMWIWH3FGIF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJP/PHTD/IWH3FGIS/FJPPHTDIWH3FGIS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZN/Z32N/IWH3FGK4/FZNZ32NIWH3FGK4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ5/Q7T6/IWH3FGK8/FJ5Q7T6IWH3FGK8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: What Do We Need ?"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Design Points\n- We need the motors to spin in opposite direction and outwards\n- The gap between the two wheels should be around 1mm\n- Plane guide gap should be around 3 to 4 mm\n\nTo start with, I cut wooden strips of\n15cm, 19cm,15cm each\n\nUsing fevicol or PVA glue stick them to make a guide.

Each player has nine pieces, or \"men\", usually coloured black and white. Players try to form 'mills'\u2014three of their own men lined horizontally or vertically\u2014allowing a player to remove an opponent's man from the game. A player wins by reducing the opponent to two pieces (where he could no longer form mills and thus be unable to win), or by leaving him without a legal move. The game proceeds in three phases: Placing men on vacant points Moving men to adjacent points(optional phase) Moving men to any vacant point when the player has been reduced to three men\nPhase 1: Placing pieces\nThe game begins with an empty board. The players determine who plays first, then take turns placing their men one per play on empty points. If a player is able to place three of his pieces on contiguous points in a straight line, vertically or horizontally, he has formed a mill and may remove one of his opponent's pieces from the board and the game. Any piece can be chosen for the removal, but a piece not in an opponent's mill must be selected, if possible. After all men have been placed, phase two begins.\nPhase 2: Moving pieces\nPlayers continue to alternate moves, this time moving a man to an adjacent point. A piece may not \"jump\" another piece. Players continue to try to form mills and remove their opponent's pieces as in phase one. A player can \"break\" a mill by moving one of his pieces out of an existing mill, then moving it back to form the same mill a second time (or any number of times), each time removing one of his opponent's men. The act of removing an opponent's man is sometimes called \"pounding\" the opponent. When one player has been reduced to three men, phase three begins.\nPhase 3: \"Flying\" When a player is reduced to three pieces, there is no longer a limitation on that player of moving to only adjacent points: The player's men may \"fly\" (or \"hop\", or \"jump\") from any point to any vacant point.\nSome rules sources say this is the way the game is played, some treat it as a variation, and some don't mention it at all. A 19th-century games manual calls this the \"truly rustic mode of playing the game\". Flying was introduced to compensate when the weaker side is one man away from losing the game.\nMy daughter got the present on her birthday and loves it a lot and should provide hours of fun and competition.\nIf you liked this please take the time to vote in the coming competitions\nThank You for reading", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5U/XT6Z/IWH38BXQ/F5UXT6ZIWH38BXQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Rules of Play"}], "channel": "Toys"}, {"category": "Play", "description": "This instructable was created in fulfillment of the project requirement of the Makecourse at the University of South Florida (www.makecourse.com)\nThis is a land sailboat-- a wind powered machine that, instead of having a hull that floats and cuts through water, has five wheels and glides across land.

Professionals use cambered boards and lay multiple sheets of sailcloth over the boards before sewing them together to give them a nice curve. However, most people, including myself, do not have the knowledge or resources required for this. For this application, cutting a sail out of the ripstop nylon will suffice. For a more downwind oriented sail, make it wider (low aspect ratio). For upwind, make it narrower (high aspect ratio). If it's going to be used in a place with high winds, make it smaller, and if it's going to be used in a place with lighter winds, make it bigger.\nNo matter the size and shape of the sail, the leading edge (the luff) should have a slight convex curve to it. This gives the sail a slight camber, even if it wasn't made with a camber board and multiple sheets of cloth like the more professional sail makers do it.\nAlso, there should be a seam allowance on the leading edge of the sail to allow it to be folded over the mast. This edge can be sewn over by hand or with a sewing machine. Professionals often use sail tape as it allows a more streamlined finish to the sail. In this project, a product called Stitch Witchery, which is basically a heat-activated fabric glue that comes in strips, was used.\nThe rear corner of the sail (the clew) should have a loop sewn on and through the hole on the end of the boom.

Depending on the precision of the 3D printer used, the pieces may require sanding to fit. Super glue or epoxy should be used to fit the pieces together. The platform with the servos on it should be slid into the main box before the back cover is placed. However, before the platform is inserted, all of the strings controlling the steering should be rigged.\nThe steering strings are tied to the bridle at the front, go back through the \"nostrils\" on the main box, loop through the servo horn on each side of the steering servo, and then tie to a hook that can be hooked on and off of the rear hole of the wheel cover. This system allows the detensioning of the system when needed for disassembly, as well as extra range of movement for the steering wheel as it amplifies the servo's movement as a pulley system would.\nBefore the back plate is put on, the strings controlling the sails should be rigged. To do this, make sure the battery is removed, and then feed a string through the hole on the top of the main box, into the hole on the back plate, through the end of the servo horn, and then back to the hole on the back plate where it should be tied. This, like the steering, allows for a larger range of movement at the cost of torque. Once the mast and sail are in place (which should be done later), the other end of the string hanging out of the hole on the main box should be fed through the hole on the end of the boom, wrapped around the mast several times, and tucked into a rubber band wrapped around the base of the mast.\nRubber bands should be placed on the base of the mast to keep the boom from falling too low. They should also flank each wheel to keep them in place. Two wheels slide onto the axles about an inch away from the main box; the other two go on the ends over the axle caps (but a string should be tied to the axle caps before the wheels go on). The front wheel goes into the wheel mount, which is then inserted into the wheel cover. The bridle is glued to the part of the wheel mount protruding from the wheel cover.\nThe last part is the standing rigging. A string should be ran from the rear hole on the wheel cover where the steering is hooked up to a hole in the top of the mast.

Regular enamel paint would have covered it a lot easier. Because this combo stain/poly was water-based, it took about 4 or 5 coats to get it dark enough to cover evenly. Good thing it dries faster so I could apply more coats quickly. Try to sand between coats to knock down any blobs or drips that appear.\nI put two screws in the back bracket so that I could mount the surge protector/power strip. It comes in handy to plug in the wall warts and power supplies for your various pedals. Most power strips have mounting or hanger holes built in to the back. I also got this power strip because the outlets are oriented side by side instead of top to bottom so it might be easier to plug in a bunch of adapters without the wires that come out of the adapter getting in the way of the next.\nTo personalize this, I used E-6000 glue to attach the brass strip at the top and the 3D printed nameplate to the top panel. I had in mind the Marshall amplifier look (Ooooo... the Marshall amplifier logo font to rock that wall of sound vibe..). Create a graphic text design. I converted the GIMP jpeg file to .SVG. You can pull that into Tinkercad to extrude it. Output as .STL into your 3D printer slicer and generate gcode to print. Note that the brass strip and nameplate are off to one side. I did that because: 1) I did not have a single long brass strip that fit the entire width of the top. I could have spliced two strips together but the seam wouldn't have looked nice. And 2) I wanted to leave room for when he gets a wah-wah pedal or something else that might be bigger and not fit the below on two slats. It all works out.\nI did have some black amplifier metal corner protectors to add but the rim on the pedal board was too small to fit where the mounting screws landed. Also I think it might be a 1/4 to 1/2 inch radius roundover on the edges to fit the cap. I guess I would have had to take the router out for a spin. You could paint a white stripe around the inside edges for that white trim banding or piping that goes around the grille cloth.\nFor final details, I attached 4 rubber feet at the bottom corners so that the unit wouldn't slide when used on hardwood floors. I also put on some rubber split loop cable clips on the bottom to help with cable management to tie down the tangle of cables that will appear.\nI got some of the heavy duty industrial strength velcro strips to attach the effects pedal to the board. Some people use tie-wraps or they have metal tab extenders that attach to the unit's feet and let you screw the unit to the board.

With the card reader, I found the angled header pins that came with it worked nicely when installed from the side of the card with the surface mount components, and the pins pointing back towards the center of the card. It really is pretty much up to you here to do as you like, but we want to get the card to lay flat, so this orientation does work well. Simply solder all the way across the row of pins to get a connection on each one. Be careful not to overheat the board while you're doing this. I like to work back and forth across the board simply to avoid too much heating in one spot. Your soldering doesn't need to be pretty - mine never is - but you'll need good connections, and make sure you don't bridge any pins.\nWith the RC522 card soldered, it is time to solder the Raspberry Pi. We'll need to solder in 7 pins on the Pi, so take your header pins, and break off one set of two pins, one set of three pins, and two single pins with your needlenose. On the Pi's board, the I/O pins are the two rows of copper colored holes running along one side of the board. The hole that has a square copper pad is pin #1, and the odd numbered pins go down that column and the even (starting with #2) go down the second column. We're going to solder a single header into pin #1 and another into pin #6. The three header pin group goes into pins 19-23, and the double header goes into pins 22 & 24 (see image for clarification)\n\nNow we need to look at connecting the Pi and the RC522. On the face of the RC522, you should notice a label for the pins We'll use this to connect to the pins on the Pi. You'll need 7 wires, so go ahead and peel off a group of seven wires from your female-female jumper set. On the RC522, connect all the pins except for the one marked IRQ. The order of the pins should be SDA/SCK/MOSI/MISO/IRQ/GND/RST/3.3V.\nNOTE: At this point, you may want to connect your RC522 to a full-size Pi board as it is easier to build the software on a full-size Pi. I'm using a Pi 3 here. If you don't go this route, you'll need to have a USB hub you can plug into the Zero's mini USB port and you'll have to set up a network connection on the Zero or use the disk image I'll provide later. The pin numbering scheme on the larger Pi boards is identical to the Zero, so swapping is easy - and that's one of the points of using the jumper cables.\nTo connect the Pi to the RC522, make the following connections:\nSDA to Pin #24\nSCK to Pin #23\nMOSI to Pin #19\nMISO to Pin #21\nGND to Pin #6\nRST to Pin #22\n3.3V to Pin #1\nWith that, your electronic build is done and we're ready to start installing the OS and program.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBB/YJYC/IVHQH8RR/FBBYJYCIVHQH8RR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0D/7OLJ/IVHQH8XY/F0D7OLJIVHQH8XY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHA/32R7/IVHQH948/FHA32R7IVHQH948.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F44/3CQ1/IVHQH9FU/F443CQ1IVHQH9FU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDK/WR1I/IVHQH9I7/FDKWR1IIVHQH9I7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVW/E2VA/IVHQH9N3/FVWE2VAIVHQH9N3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRA/H87R/IVHQH9IK/FRAH87RIVHQH9IK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHO/6LVI/IVHQH9L1/FHO6LVIIVHQH9L1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJQ/U01I/IVHQH9OD/FJQU01IIVHQH9OD.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Soldering and Electrical Connections"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "For this step you will need:\nMicroSD cards\nComputer with\nSDFormatter\nWin32DiskImager\nInsert the SD card into your computer and format it using SDFormatter\n\nGo to https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/ and download the latest Raspbian distribution.

These tags can hold a lot more information than we'll need on its various sectors, but for our purposes, all we need is the UID so we know what animal is being scanned. So we just need to read the UID, and fortunately, most of the work has been done for us. So let's configure the Pi so it can read card.\nPlug in your Pi to a monitor via an HDMI cable\nConnect your pi to the internet (ethernet cable or wifi - this is where having the full-size pi comes in helpful, as it is easier to connect)\nAttach a keyboard and mouse to the Pi\nPlug in the power adapter\nThe Pi will now boot and we'll make a few configuration changes\nOpen a terminal window and at the command prompt enter the following commands in order:\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get update\nNow go to the raspberry in the upper left corner of the screen, pull down that menu and select preferences->configuration->interfaces, and then click on enable spi.

Before we get to reading in all the UIDs, let's edit the Read.py script to display the fifth numerical entry of the UID tag number. This is pretty straightforward and shown in the images above - under the #Print UID line, add the string +\",\"+str(uid[4]) to the end of the line to get the last entry to print.\nNow make sure your pi is running the Read.py script as described in the previous step, and start scanning your tags and cards. For each tag, record the UID displayed on the screen. I like to do this using masking tape applied to the tag itself, and just writing the UID on the tape. That way there is no chance of getting numbers mismatched. You should not find that any two tags have the same UID, as the odds of this occurring are infinitesimal, but in case you do, make sure to only use one of them and buy a lottery ticket while you're at it.\n\nOne final note: You will need to discover the UID of a key tag for each animal you're going to use plus one card for each child you want an ID badge for. I would also recommend one additional tag or card that you can use for an \"escape\" function. When we get the program up and running, we will have it start automatically on bootup and in fullscreen mode - stopping the program to edit it is very difficult without an escape function, and the easiest way to do that is to have one RFID tag that will cause the program to terminate.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLK/ZXPF/IVO37DHF/FLKZXPFIVO37DHF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP2/2PWQ/IVHQO362/FP22PWQIVHQO362.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEW/CALI/IVO37DQE/FEWCALIIVO37DQE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Determining the UID of Each RFID Tag"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Now that you know the UIDs of each tag, it's time to start altering the Read.py script to do what we want. Basically, all we're going to do is add if statements to the script to allow for displaying a specific image (or one from an assortment of images) whenever a given tag is scanned.\nI like to do this by defining each tag right after the import statements at the top of the script. For each tag and card, we'll give a different name. For instance, if the UID of a tag was 181,165,221,82,159, we could define that as tag1 and use the line:\n\ntag1 = [181, 165, 221, 82, 159]\nSo once again, use the sudo nano Read.py command at the command prompt to edit the python script. Add in each of the tags you recorded, and write the tag # on the masking tape for each tag, just for clarification and ease as we get to affixing them to the stuffed animals later.\nWhen you're done, your script should look like the image above, only with your UID tag numbers used.\nNow scroll down to just beneath the print \"Card read UID: \" line, and we're going to add if statements for each tag. The basic block should be as follows for each tag (remove the . at the start of the second line - I added that simply to make the indent show up on this instructable)\nif uid == tag 1:\n. print \"tag 1\"\nRepeat this for each tag, but substitute elif for if on every tag after the first one, and be VERY careful to match the indents, so each if statement should start indented the same amount as the print \"Card read UID: \" line, and the print line in each block you add should be indented from the if statement. If you fail to do this, python is likely to throw a fit at you. Once you've added all your blocks, save the script and exit the editor. Now launch the python script with the sudo python Read.py command and verify each of your tags is printing the correct id to the screen. If not, check the tag definitions in your script.\n\nWhen you verify that all the tags are reading properly and printing their tag # to the screen, it is time to clear out some code we won't need anymore. To do this, you can comment out the print \"Card read UID:\" line as well as the authentication lines (see the images above).

Next thing you need to do is find x ray images for each animal you want to tag. Just find some images online to use or even ask a vet if they have any interesting ones. You'd be amazed at what you can find. For additional fun, get several images per animal, and I'll show you how you can use them all on one animal. Also feel free to use silly images as well. I've used \"xrays\" of stuffed bears instead of real bears and a trojan horse diagram instead of a real horse. As you find images, make sure that they're sized to the dimensions of your screen (ie, 1920x1080 or 1280x720). If they can't fill the entire screen, consider expanding the image canvas in a photo editor and leaving the margins black. Also, feel free to add highlights to point out the issue, such as a broken bone, and provide help to the child \"diagnosing\" the illness.\nYou also need to create additional images - one image for the welcome splash screen, one for each ID card to welcome each child when they \"check in\", and one for your shutdown card (see above for ideas)\n\nWhen you have your images, get them onto your pi. If you collected them on the pi already, good news - just move them to your MFRC522-python directory. If not, connect your pi to your network and ftp them over to the Pi. If you aren't sure of your Pi's IP number, type ifconfig at the command prompt and you should be able to find it.\nNow we're going back to editing the Read.py script. After the import commands, add the following three import lines:\nimport pygame\nimport random\nimport os\nAfter you've defined your cards and tags, add in the following block:\nfrom pygame.locals import *\nrandom.seed()\npygame.init()\nWIDTH=1920\nHEIGHT=1080\nwindowSurface= pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT), 0, 24)\nimg=pygame.image.load(\"welcome.jpg\")\npygame.display.toggle_fullscreen()\nNow we need to also add a command to the beginning of the loop where the program looks for cards to display that image on the screen. Below the \"while continue_reading:\" statement, add the following:\nwindowSurface.blit(img, (0,0))\npygame.display.flip()\nWhile you're at this section of the code, consider adding the following statement right before the \"while continue_reading:\" statement: (not pictured above)\nMIFAREReader.IncGain()\nThis will ensure that your reader is operating at the max gain it can so it can read cards easily.\nNext go to each of your if blocks for the tags. If you only have one image, you can add the following at the same indent level as the print \"tag #\" statement:\nimg=pygame.image.load(\"xray.jpg\")\nwindowSurface.blit(img, (0,0))\npygame.display.flip()\nIf you have more than one image, it is only slightly more complicated. For these cases, you'll need to select a random number (by default, this is a uniform distribution between 0 and 1), and then assign probabilities to each image. In the following example, I had two images for a seal, one I wanted to show 2/3 of the time, and the other I wanted to show the remainder of the time.\nif uid == tag1:\nx=random.random()\nif x < 0.666:\nimg = pygame.image.load(\"seal1.jpg\")\nwindowSurface.blit(img, (0,0))\npygame.display.flip()\nelse:\nimg = pygame.image.load(\"seal2.jpg\")\nwindowSurface.blit(img, (0,0))\npygame.display.flip()\n# print \"tag 1\"\nJust follow this basic structure (remove the leading . I put in to get the indents clear) and have the script call your image files accordingly. Calling the images for the ID badges is identical in form, though you would only have a single image that would load. For the shutdown card, the function is slightly different, as we want it to call a system shutdown command. For this card, use the following:\nelif uid=idcard3:\nimg = pygame.image.load(\"goodbye.jpg\")\nwindowSurface.blit(img, (0,0))\npygame.display.flip()\nsleep(10)\nos.system(\"shutdown now -h\")\npygame.display.toggle_fullscreen()\n\nAt this point, all the programming should be done.

When you autostart the program, it will do so from the /home/pi directory, so you either have to have the images there or you have to edit your path so it can find it. Copying them is easier. Assuming you're still in the MFRC522-python directory, you can just run the following command:\ncp *.jpg ~\nenter the following commands in the MFRC522-python directory:\nchmod +x Read.py\nsudo nano /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart\n\nThen in the editor, add the following line at the end of the file:\n@/usr/bin/python /home/pi/MFRC522-python/Read.py\nSave this file, and from now on, when you start your pi, it will automatically boot into the x-ray script. You may want to make a backup image of your sd card at this point using Win32diskimager (clicking on read instead of write).\nNOTE: Once you set the pi to autostart the program, it will be harder to edit the script, so ensuring everything is working well before setting the autostart is helpful\n\nNow, if you've been using a full size Pi for development, you can remove the SD card and switch your wiring back to the Pi Zero - see the prior step if you need a refresher on the wiring connections.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 8: Setting the Pi to Autostart the Program"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "For this step you will need:\n3d printer and black filament (or color of your choice) OR:\nother method of your choice to make covers for cutouts\n3d printer with red and black filament OR\nother method of your choice to decorate the front of the machine\nDrill / drill press\nKeyhole saw\nFile\n\nNow we're going to modify the enclosure for the machine. There are two cutaways we'll make in the enclosure - one on the side, and one on the bottom. The side cutout is to allow for the power cord and the HDMI cable to go through the enclosure, and the bottom one is simply a cutout to allow for a thinner structure for the RFID scanner to penetrate. I've included .stl files above for the two parts I designed to close these openings once we've made them and fed wires through. You don't need to use these, but you'll want something to close the opening around the cables at the very least. The one for the RFID reader is a little more optional, but it does also help your child find the spot to hold the stuffed animal next to.\n\nIf you do choose to use these stls, the files are defined with millimeters as the unit of measure, and you'll need to print them on a 3D printer or find a printing service. It is also worthwhile to check with your local library - many now have 3D printers as a service. I printed these myself, using black ABS filament. Color is your choice, and PLA would work fine, if you desire.\n\nWhen you have your parts, just use a permanent marker or awl to mark the corners where you want each cutout to go on your enclosure (see pictures). Be sure to use the inner ring of the pieces, not the outer. Then simply connect the dots to get your cutout lines. You can cutout along the lines in any manner you choose, though here I use a drill press to create a series of holes along the outline, which I then connect using a keyhole saw and file down until the inserts fit.\nWhen you can put the inserts in, simply hot glue them in place. Be sure to feed your cables through the cable opening before gluing it in place, naturally.\n\nTo decorate the front of the device, I printed out a cross in red PLA on my printer and the word X-RAY in black ABS. The stls are provided above, but you can decorate any way you prefer. For attaching them to the box, I found hot glue works fine. It gets a little messy around the letters, but once it is cool, you can easily trim out any slop with a hobby knife.\nAs one final step, i like to print out a case for the Pi Zero. You could purchase one, or risk going without. The risk is pretty minimal, but it is nice to isolate the electronics. I used this case from Thingiverse and printed it in black ABS. The Pi simply presses in and the cover snaps on. If the cover wants to pop off, you can secure it with a dab or two of hot glue strategically placed on the outside. You can also glue the case to the back of the enclosure if you would like, or leave it floating.

Its intended to provide ideas about how you might design and build your own stand. Sorry, but this is not a full step-by-step guide and I haven't provided a detailed parts list.\nThe stand works great for my purposes. It easily adjusts to fit me (6' male) and my daughter (4' 8 year old). Its very stable and I think it will last. This stand was built for function -- as I'm sure you can see, I did not put any effort into form :)\nI built this stand for a bit under $60, including the office chair, which I found at goodwill for $8... of course your mileage will vary there. The design changed in several major ways as I built it. I ended up with roughly $20 in unused materials, so you could probably build this for about $40 (depending on what you can find for a chair).\nI initially intended to use a couch or a dining room chair for a seat, but quickly discovered that these were very uncomfortable options.\nAs noted in the images, I built the stand too long. The front overhang keeps the stand from fully folding. The rear overhang is unnecessarily long.\nOf course, you'll need some woodworking tools and skills to do this.", "title": "Adjustable Racing Wheel Stand and Seat", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Adjustable-Racing-Wheel-Stand-and-Seat/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Base Design\nThe side rails consist of a 2x2 on top of a 1x2 with a 1/4\" shim between them. The 1/4\" gap between the 2x2 and 1x2 is used as a \"rail\" for the pedal mechanism to slide on (see the next step for more on that).\nThe middle rail is a 1x2.\nThe ends are 1x4s. I think I had to trim them slightly to be the same height as the side rails.\nAll parts a glued and screwed together.\nI made the stand a bit longer than it should be. After trimming it down, the dimensions of the base will be 26\" long x 22\" wide. The width is 22\" because that is the width of the metal Simpson Ties I used for the sliding mechanism -- this way, I didn't need to cut the Ties shorter. I think the stand is slightly wider than needed, but I wouldn't go narrower than about 18\".\nTable Design\nThe table is built out of 1/2\" plywood. The sides and top are 6\" wide. I reinforced the top using an extra strip of plywood along the back. I should have used angle brackets instead, but didn't have any on had. I also should not have put any screws through the sides of the plywood (again, angle brackets would have solved that). Plywood does not hold screws/nails well when they are put in through the side.\nThe sides of the table should placed 5\" from the front edge so that the stand can fold flat. This means that when looking at the 26\" side rail, you would have 5\" of exposed rail, 6\" of rail covered by a plywood side, then 15\" of exposed rail.\nThe pieces of plywood attached to the sides of the base are 10\" tall (we'll call those the \"fixed sides\"). The pieces of plywood that are attached to the table top and bolt on to the fixed sides are 16\" (we'll call those the \"adjustable sides\"). This gives plenty of height adjustment for my setup. The height you need for your table will depend on the height of your chair (and height of the users).

The fence bracket helps keep the sliding mechanism centered.\nNext, I cut a very thin shim at a slight angle (since the base rises at an angle) and attached that to the plywood just behind the fence bracket This shim will attach to the first simpson tie. Next I cut a riser (at the same angle) and a thicker shim (no angle) and attached those to the other end of the plywood. This is for attaching the second simpson tie.\nFinally, I placed the plywood pedal base in place on the frame. I slid the simpson ties in place, carefully centered them so that they were not exposed on either side of the frame, and screwed them into shims.\nThat completets the stand. As you can see, I use a spring clamp to hold the pedal base in place. It's simple and effective.

Swirl it around twice a day for two days.\nAfter two days, remove the bearings from the jar (save the jar and WD-40). Soak the bearings in hot soapy water for 10-15 minutes.

So, for those that don't know, before Classical Guitars started coming with Nylon strings they used to use Gut for string, stranding it out, twisting and drying it with other steps involved. These strings are usually tied to the Baroque period of music and some guitars aren't even called classical, you might hear as the instrument, \"the baroque guitar.\" These strings are expensive and must be kept moist to work properly, which is why with the coming of Nylon strings the classical guitar world could open up to the poorer individuals (I think metal violin strings existed for a while, but classical guitars cannot handle that tension). This is great, and makes these instruments accessible. Now you might ask, \"If it ain't baroque, why fix it?\" Well, these strings have a tinny/plasticy sound that many might not like. Also, the newer carbon fiber strings still don't quite sound baroque; in my opinion, they have a kind of high tech sound.\nSo, I found a way to get cheapo nylon strings to sound like a kind of gut string, as this isn't expensive at all, try it out and if ya want let me know if you like it! Also, this might work for other instruments, if you play those and try it out on them, you can let me know in the comment section bellow how that goes! :)\nAll you'll need is your Nylon strings and the finest grade steel wool (0000 grade).", "title": "Make Nylon Strings Sound Like Gut Strings / Baroque Hack", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Nylon-Strings-Sound-Like-Gut-Strings-Baroque-/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Now you can probably take them off, or use new strings that aren't installed yet, but when I did this, I just used the strings I was still playing with without taking them off.

The RC-2 looper comes along with it, since they were originally paired together (footswitch controls Stop and Next Loop on the RC-2). This also freed up space on my larger PedalTrain board, so now everything on the PedalTrain is guitar signal chain only, and the footswitch/looper have their own smaller board. The goal was achieved and I'm very pleased all around.\nThis was really easy to make and it would be easy to add a couple of D Rings or something like that for additional cable management. Obviously I didn't attempt to have any cable management (i.e. drilled holes or separate panes like PedalTrain). Considering how few pedals can be on the board, and the low height, it just didn't seem to apply here. I did find that, with the 1 Spot having to be plugged/unplugged, it was inconvenient enough to keep me from wanting to bother with powering it up whenever I turn my computer on. You wouldn't think that just plugging an A/C adaptor in to a power strip would be t hat inconvenient, but it was. So I found an in-line power switch that I could mount to the board. This allows the 1 Spot to be plugged in full time in a power strip, and I can switch on the pedal board very conveniently, right at the board.\nhttps://www.adafruit.com/product/1125#tutorials", "title": "Basic Small Pedalboard", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Basic-Small-Pedalboard/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I was able to make the board from spare parts, with the exception of paint. Because I want to power the FS-6 footswitch without battery, I also purchased a battery clip converter for the 1Spot (which I have two of). The board was an extra piece of pine 1x8, already an appropriate size for my needs. The black handle I had spare in a box of stuff, and the adhesive velcro I had leftover from my PedalTrain board.\nThe feet came from a stash of furniture glides and feet that I've removed over the years and collected. The Black feet (used for bottom of board) already had holes in them and I just used appropriate length screws. The small hard plastic glides (close up pic) are lower height for front of board to provide some angle front to back. They had nails embedded and I just drilled them out, then drilled countersink holes to accommodate the screw heads. For both, the screw heads are beneath surface so they won't stick out and scratch floors.\nI laid the feet out and pre-drilled holes before painting. Same thing for the handle on the top side, with the pedals to make sure layout was going to work. I sanded the pine board before painting, but if someone wants a real nice smooth surface, probably should do something like fill in irregularities with spackle, then sand with a block.

Because this model may glide surprisingly far; when balanced well, the flying path may be 30-40 meters. I've tested this small model in a large gymnasium, and it flew from wall to wall.\nSince the building time is so short, this model may be built multiplied to keep an airplane contest in a classroom or a camp meeting, too.\nI found the original version in a classroom activity page, and made some of them for my special students in the school, then edited a bit and named \"Ciconia\", what means \"stork\" in Latin, because this small flying wing glides like a stork.", "title": "Build Stork, the Easy But Amazing Flying Wing!", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Build-Stork-the-Easy-But-Amazing-Flying-Wing/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Tools\n-scissors\n-pencil\n-glue\n-ruler\nMaterials\n-An A4 sheet cardboard, NOT copy or light printer paper.

If you want, you can draw a copy with ruler and pencil, to edit and modify the face of Ciconia. But you may also rename it - try the name \"Grus\" - this is the crane, an other long neck bird in Latin...;-)\nAfter the ornitology, grab a pair of scissors, cut the wing itself, and the 2 pcs. vertical stabilizers. At the dotted lines you should fold them in 90 degrees to get a small surface for the glueing onto the main wing.\nFor this operation push your ruler on the dotted folding line to deform the stabilizer at the necessary line. After it you can already fold it exactly in 90 degrees. Repeat this on the other stabilizer, and on the dotted lines at the tips of the main wing below the \"Ciconia\" writing. (But DON'T fold the main wing at the centre! That line shows the place of the stick.) The wing tips must be folded 45-50 degrees up, not 90, but they must be set symmetrically. With this angle this small modell will follow the smaller air turbulences or other anomalies around itself, and will be able to set back the wings to a horizontal position, which is important for the long flying path.\nNow take the stick, and glue it below the central dotted line, at the bottom side of the wing, from the rear to the nose. And avoid to glue the stick to the horizontal stabilizer, or what the name is that small surface at the rear of the wing.\nAt the nose let cca. 10-15 cms to point forward. Now cut the balance, roll it on a pencil, or the fuselage stick itself, and strenghten it with some glue; this is the balance weight on the nose.\nPull it on the nose, but press it a bit, if necessary, to avoid the unwanted moving of it on the stick.

This is Ciconia itself.\nFor the optimal flying you should balance it. Grab the bottom spine of the model at the middle of the wing, and throw it softly forward, a bit downward, and look how it sinks. At a quick sinking pull the balance towards the wing, while the model advances with the minimal sinking. At a pumping, bobbing flying pull the balance forward, to increase the distance between the wing and the balance. The optimal flying path is almost a horizontal line with a little sinking.\nWhen ready, carefully flip the rear tab up with some degrees; you will see the model will lift its nose, but after it will lose the speed, and begins to go towards the ground. At the down flipping you may balance the pumping movement of the model.\nFind the optimal position of the roll balance AND the stabilizer tab to keep Ciconia on the best flying path. This may keep some minutes to find it, but it worths, because the model will produce a very amazing flying.\nThis was the one of the axises. The other is balanced with the wing tips and the vertical stabilizers, but here I recommend you not to try any steering, just set the perfect symmetry as I mentioned, to gain a perfect straight flying path. While your model turns out to left or right, the balance is not ready.\nBut when ready, you'll have a very good small flying wing-style paper model for indoor or outdoor using.

Between the pieces of plywood I put a number of small plywood parts to act as distance. This distance will also decide how \"fat\" your guitar will be. mine is about 1 dm (4\").\nIn the pictures You can also see how I left a hole for the neck in the front piece of the frame while I saved that part in the back frame.

To adapt to the round shapes of the guitar I sometimes had to cut them on the length. On reason to take the side before the front is that you then can cover the end-parts from the side with the top sticks.\nAfter covering front and side I stabilized at the inside by gluing 2 extra sticks before drilling a hole. U can see the in the image above. As next step I had to cover the inside of the guitar with generously amounts of wood glue to make it tight. There shouldn't be any holes between the sticks.\nLast part of this step is the use sandpaper until the guitar is as smooth as you like it", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ3/X7VI/IVA4HD9Z/FQ3X7VIIVA4HD9Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY1/L1WB/IVA4HDA6/FY1L1WBIVA4HDA6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Covering the Front and Side of Your Guitar"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "I had some problems to decide what wood I should use for the neck.

I shaped the form of the neck with a band saw (very rough), a knife (most part) and sanding paper (finish) until I was happy with the shape.\nMy best tips how to do this is to compare it with another guitar you like to play and try to get it as similair as possible\nAt the head I made my niggest mistake with this guitar.

You should put the neck and the body together. Before you glue the neck at the proper place at the body you need to consider the angle between the parts. Hold the neck where it should be and check the height between the strings and the neck.\nOne tips is to put a straight piece of wood where the strings will be and check so the height is correct. Remember that once you glued the strings at place it\u00b4s very hard to redo it. At my guitar I got the strings a bit to far from the neck from what would have been ideal.\nYou might also want to consider if you want to paint the body before you put the parts together. I chosed to put tape on the neck when I spray painted the body but it might have been easier to paint the body before.\nI used spray paint at my guitar. One reason for this is that I wanted the paint to seal all possible small openings in the body which might have been missed while gluing the inside. I first put 2 layers of white paint on the inside. When it dired I tried to put fire flames ( I know, I'm not an epic artist concerning taping fire flames...) with tape before I put on 2 more layers of black paint. When it all dried I removed the tape and sprayed two more layers of vanish to have a glossy surfice.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7Z/QF6Q/IVA4HDA8/F7ZQF6QIVA4HDA8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Put It Together and Paint"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "I bought most equipment I needed for my project at ebay.

Then step a step back and make sure its looks right. Every fret space should be a bit smaller then the one before.\nWhen you got the positions right you need some thin saw to make the spaces where you should press in the wire.

This is not the instructable which will teach you how to use a 3D printer or a CAD software. I assume you already seen a locomotive modell, a printer and a 3D modelling program, but you're hesitating to before making your first modell. I also assuming you have the basic modelling knowledge in DCC programming, and you can use a solder to connect two wires. I was in the same situation a year ago, and I want to show my design and the product, to encourage you starting your project. It is not as hard as you think, but it will took more time than I thougt before. You will need the following things: -Basic 3D modelling skills -3D modelling program (Sketchup, DesignSpark Mechanical) -Drawings, blueprints and photos from the original locomotive -Motor blocks and wheels -Some free time for drawing -A 3D printer (any type will do it) -Sanding paper, paint sprays -LED's for ligths, some screws for assembly, hook couplings for the bogies, and a DCC decoder if needed -Basic modelling tools: sharp knife, sanding paper, etc First of all take a look of a garden railway loco. The details are sturdy, designed to be able to operate outside, heavy enough to pull a long train. Some details might missing, but it has to be easy serviceable, and the T&W parts had to be easy to replace (eg: pickup shoes). The loco in this instructable is my second design, and the first one in G scale. I choose the M\u00c1V class V42 electric locomotive because there are a lot of blueprints, photos and other datas available, and I was able to find a mathcing powered bogie with etched wheels and pantographs from a manufacturer. This made the whole thing easier, I don't had to design and make this important parts. I suggest you for your first loco choose one which has enough information and datas, and there is a powered bogie available for driving it from a manufacturer. You can try to make powered bogies on your later designs, but for the first time don't waste time with this. Collect as many blueprint from your desired locomotive as you can: drawings from front, side and top view are necessary to make the 3D modell. If possible, go to a local locomotive repair shop to take photos and measurements from the real locomotive. This will allow you to make the small parts and details as the original. I think that's all we need to start designing a garden railway locomotive", "title": "V42 Electric Locomotive in G Scale for Garden Railways", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/V42-Electric-Locomotive-in-G-Scale-for-Garden-Rail/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "You will need a simple 3D modelling program and basic modelling capabilities to design the modell. I'm using DesignSpark Mechanical, it is a very easy-to-use and free program, and can export the OBJ files which will be needed for your 3D printer.\nPrepare the blueprints and have a calculator in hand. A G scale european modell for normal gauge (1435mm) is at about 1:26 scale. It varies for different countries and gauges, can be 1:32, 1:22,5 or 1:29, measure one of your G scale modells, because you have to calculate with the right proportion, to match your loco to the existing ones. I calculated with 1:26, because I have european modells for normal gauge. I printed the blueprints, each view to a separate page, and then converted the measurements to 1:26 and wrote them to the paper. The V42 class locomotive is a 4 axle one, with 2 bogies. I found out the PIKO powered bogie for their E94 locomotive is a close match in measurements and wheelbase to what I need for my loco. However, I altered some of the measurements on the modell to fit the factory bogies.\nTake a look at your existing garden railway loco: you will need to design your new loco in the same way. You will need a strong base to attach the bogie and carry the chassis, and it has to be easy to remove. It has to be easy to remove the chassis from the base plate, you can use hooks, clips or screws. You have to design space for the DCC plate and the speaker (not necessary).\nThen you can start drawing your first locomotive. Start with the easy parts first. You can add the blueprints as a background to your design program, it will help a lot, don't forget to scale the drawings to the proportion you choose.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQV/X5WW/IV0BHY8W/FQVX5WWIV0BHY8W.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Making the 3D Modell"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "After the easy parts are drawn, you can start adding details for your locomotive. Keep in mind: you have to print this locomotive with your 3D printer. Draw the loco to \"be printable\". What does it mean? Do not attach parts. Keep the parts of the locomotive body apart. You will print them separately and later will glue them together. Draw the roof and the small parts as a separate part: you also print those things separately and will attach to the body later. This will also make painting easier.\nUse your photos to add as many details as you can. Like small parts to the roof, door hinges, etc.\nTo draw the bogie there is one important thing: it has to look like the original one, but it don't had to be work like the original one! You can draw all as one part, with a flat back side. Measure your powered bogie and examine it where you can attach your bogie frames. Add the holes for the screws, this will make your assemly work easier and faster.\nFor the chassis, add the holes for the assembly screws. Design the place for speaker and DCC plate carefully, the DCC plate can be hot and it will melt the printed chassis. Add the holes for the lamps wiring. If you're planning to have a sound loc, see your speaker measurements, and the sound holes also. Keep in mind that you will have to paint and assembly the whole locomotive, design it to make your work easy. The more details you add the more work you have, but more realistic loco you will have!\nDo not forget to design places for ballast weights inside. Since your loco will be printed from ABS or PLA, it will be very light and unable to pull a train. You have to thing where can you hide some metal ballasting inside or under the loco body. I used 2cm x 2cm metal rods in the longer engine hood.

Do not start to print the loco until you are 100% sure, your design is printable. This step needs some 3D printing knowledge.\nDo not lay the parts flat. I printed the locomotive in 3 big groups:\n-Base plate: this is the base of the loco, the bogies and chassis will be attached to that. This is a thick object, required time and material, but this will hold your loco in one. Since this was too big to print in one piece, I designed it in 2 parts, with holes and parts to glue them together\n-Chassis: this consisted 9 parts. 4 big one for the chassis walls, 3 roof parts, 2 parts for the engine room roofs. All of this attached together with glue.\n-Bogies and small parts: the bogie frames are consisted 5 parts each, and there were several smaller parts (insulators, pantograph holders, lamps, hinges, ladders and other detailing parts)\nFor the best output you have to know your 3D printer capabilities: some parts will require different layer height. Lowering the value of layer height will increase the printing time, but you will get way better results. I printed the whole chassis on 0,1mm layer height. It took a day to print all the chassis parts, but it required minimum sanding.\nIf needed, do some test-prints: resize your parts to minimize printing time or prints only smaller pieces of the whole modell, to test different values.

If you're using PLA as I did use a very high quality glue only (Henkel, Pattex, gel glues). Be careful of the gases while glueing the parts together. Use a solid, smooth plate to assembly the parts in-line.\nMost 3D printed parts has a specific surface pattern. Now there is the hard part, to eliminate this surface patterns. After glueing the parts together, you have to apply a ground coating to it first. Use a fast-dryer one. If you printed your locomotive from PLA you can use 1K or 2K sprays, if you're using ABS be careful, some sprays will harm it and make the surface rough and you may have to print it again. Let your primer dry. Then you have to sand this layer down from the whole modell. You can start with a rough sander, use a waterproof one and apply water to the surface when sanding. After the ground coat sanded down, apply another one, and sand it down again, until the surface will be smooth enough. If there are bumps, and thick layers, you can apply putty to them. Putty also needs to dry completely before sanding, and you can only apply a thin layer at once. Be sure to use a putty which is re-paintable and your spray won't burn it! While sanding, be careful with the small parts and surface details. Cover them if necessary with masking tape. I had to apply putty to the roof parts to make them smooth, and the sides sanded down two times before final painting.\nWhen all of your parts has a smooth surface, clean them thorougly, and apply the base coat again, and then you can paint it. Use a matching content paint and primer only! Apply at least two layers of paint, your loco will be used outside, the paint layers are for protecting, not only for decorating. Let the paint dry wholly before starting assembling the loco.

Add as many parts as you can using screws, it will alllow you to remove and repair if necessary. Test the weight needs and add only the needed amount of ballast to avoid damaging the motors or decoder. Adjust the decoder settings to match your track and train needs. This will require a bit if testing. Add connectors to the wiring to make removing the chassis easier: for example the lights are fitted to the chassis and the decoder is on the base plate, add a connector to the wiring to be able to remove the chassis without needed to cutting the wires.\nNow you have your own designed and printed locomotive.

That second piece you see is to keep my surface level. My table isn\u2019t long enough for the entire length, so I put that other piece underneath to make things level and stable rather than having the teeter totter effect going on. Very annoying when trying to hold things stable.\nAlso, one of my boards had a diagonal chunk missing completely. You do want the top of your coffin to be level for the lid to fit properly, but still, it doesn\u2019t need to be perfect. Remember, poor Lretta couldn\u2019t afford something nice. I simply laid my yard stick along the top to make the adjustments, clamped it, then drilled it into place. Rather than doing a bunch of measuring, I just put the boards on, then trimmed the edges all at once. That is, for the ones that need it. You\u2019ll notice, not all of the boards go all the way to the edge. Some had to be adjusted in order to be long enough. Poor Lretta.

Like the sides, you aren\u2019t going to have any boards the entire length of the lid. That\u2019s fine. All you need to know is how long and how wide this needs to be. I decided mine would have two cross boards as well as the ones across the top and bottom. Now is where all those years of playing Tetris are going to come in handy. If you played Tetris, that is. I didn\u2019t. We\u2019ll just do the best we can.\nThis part was the most fun. At first, I was going to make the lid more or less as I had the rest of the box \u2013 that is, scruffy and imperfect, but complete. But as I was arranging them in my epic Tetris initiation, I started looking at some of my broken and splintered boards. They looked really interesting. I had originally thought to lay the coffin lid propped up against the box, but lying on the ground in order to see the skeleton within. But what if there was a big hole in the top? This actually made it harder. I needed more broken boards than I had, and I needed them oriented in such a way, and in the correct lengths, that they would give me the effect I wanted. I also realized I wanted a third cross board. A partial one, anyway. That one got broken, too. Your hammer is going to come in handy here. As I mentioned earlier, pallet boards are brittle. So you don\u2019t have one broken in a way that will work? No problem! Swing away. Take out that frustration. Once you figure out how you want everything arranged, set them aside, in the right order, so you can start putting it together. I also took a few of my little broken pieces and attached them with some finishing nails. Just be sure the cross boards are long enough that you can screw your lid together on them, but short enough that they will slide into the box. The same is true of the boards going across the top and bottom. You\u2019re going to need some pretty good measurements here.

It sticks well to itself and other smooth surfaces, and as such, can be used to make all kinds of 3D designs, including impromptu props and decorations.\nIf you stick around to the end, I will channel my inner 6 year old and show you how I used to make my own press on nails (It was my 6 year old answer to the Lee Press On Nails so popular at that time. Are you old enough to remember the numerous commercials?).

How many will you need? I ran an experiment and found that each Babybel cheese wax wrapper will coat approximately 40 inches of Lily Sugar N' Cream cotton yarn.\nDon't forget to salvage the wax stuck to the paper pull tab. You won't be able to get it all off the paper, but you can easily remove a good chunk of it.\nI bought a giant 32 count bag from Costco for $10.99, which makes them about 34 cents each, and should make about 35 yards of bendy waxed yarn (If I did my math right).\nYarn - I chose 100% cotton for its absorbent and wicking nature. I used white (which turned out red) and black (which stayed black). One of the advantages to making them yourself, is that you can make them whatever length you wish. I did find however, that when I made the yarn segments over an arms lengths, they became very unwieldy to fish out of the pot and spread out to cool.\nDouble Boiler - I used two empty soup cans in a pot of water. Using two cans filled the pot and prevented them from up-ending, and I got to experiment with two different wax formulas.\nScissors for cutting yarn\nForceps to suspend the yarn during dunking or fish it out of the wax for the stir method\nWax Paper, Foil, etc to protect surfaces during cooling\nAlternate Recipe:I also experimented with a beeswax base. It worked, but I didn't love it. If you are interested, here is what I used:\nBeeswax - 1 oz bar (Vitamin Cottage $1.25)\nCocoa Butter - 1/8 teaspoon\nCoconut Oil - 1/8 teaspoon\nI used white yarn and it turned out an off-white yellow color (this is what I used for the spider's web in the photos)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKV/T4OM/IV0BKDDQ/FKVT4OMIV0BKDDQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWH/ZSON/IUYD28EP/FWHZSONIUYD28EP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Materials"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Heat the wax in the double boiler until fully liquefied.\n\nWhen the wax is all melted, dunk pieces of yarn into the wax, one at a time.

You may need to repeat the dunking multiple times in order to coat the yarn, as it sometimes it just coils up, preventing sections from being submerged in the wax. When the wax stops dripping, transfer the yarn to a cooling area lined with parchment, wax paper, or foil. I tried just regular butcher paper, but it pulled some of the paper fibers off.\nOne method I liked was shoving a length of yarn into the can and just stirring it around until it was fully coated and then fishing it out with my forceps.\nTroubleshooting: If the wax is too cool when dunking, you will get a heavy build up on the yarn and start to form a candle. If this happens, you can just drop the yarn into the wax (if you want to salvage it), turn up the heat if necessary, and wait until the wax melts and becomes less viscous before fishing it out.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FG2/Q7WM/IV0AYQ3H/FG2Q7WMIV0AYQ3H.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Heat, Dunk, and Cool"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "As you can see from the photos, there are all kinds of things you can make and do with waxed yarn. Let your imagination be your guide.\nHalloween Claws (as promised)\nTake a length of waxed yarn approximately 7 to 8 inches. Bend approximately 3/4 of an inch or 2 cm back onto itself and gently press together. With the bend pointing upward and the long and short legs pointing down, coil the long leg around the short leg, and then up and over the top bend. Continue coiling and gently pressing the waxed string together until the string is all coiled into a flat oblong oval disc. You can then gently squish one end to make it more triangular and claw like.\nTo attach to nails, line up the bulbous end with the edge your cuticle and press firmly, rocking back and forth across the round of the nail.\nI have found they stay stuck to the nail very well. I could vigorously wiggle my fingers and shake my hands and they wouldn't fall off. They will pop off if you try to actually use your hands to do things, like type or pick up a piece of paper off a desk. They will work really well if you just want to jump out and scare someone though.\nSpider and Web Decoration\nThis stuff sticks to walls and windows really well.\nTo make a quick and easy spider web decoration, crisscross two segments into a plus sign, then add another plus sign, crossing at the origin of the first, but rotated 45 degrees. Starting in the middle of the spokes, begin to spiral outward, pressing the string into each spoke as you pass it. To give it a nice swoopy look, pinch the spiraling string into a \"V\" pointing outward before pressing into each spoke.\nWhen done, you can gently peel it off your work surface. It should have some movement, but generally hold its original shape. You can then just press it where ever you want it, a corner or window frame works well.\nTo add a spider, coil two flat discs. I made a large oval for the body and a smaller circle for the head. I pressed the head onto the body and then flipped it over. I cut 4 even segments for the legs. I pressed the middle of each segment into the middle of the body and then arranged the legs and bent them to make knees. I then pressed the spider onto the web.\nThis might be the easiest and fastest decoration I have ever made in my life, AND it can just be taken apart and fashioned into something new for the next season or holiday.\nPhoto Booth Prop Idea\nPlaying around with it, I thought it might be fun for impromptu props at a photo booth. It would be interesting to give guests at a party a few lengths each and then see what they come up with. It will temporarily stick to your face long enough for a photo, but not long enough to be an all day costume, well at least not on my face, it is way too oily (Which brings up the point, if you give this idea a try, give your guests fresh unused pieces of waxed yarn. Nobody wants to use pieces previously stuck to somebody else's face. YUCK!)\nFinal Thoughts and Warnings\nIt does leave a slight residue on the hands (as all toys like this do), and a few times I got it too warm and had to put it in the freezer for a minute to cool down and become less soft and sticky. I found the Babybel strings worked well at room temperatures below 72 degrees Fahrenheit, but frequently became a bit too soft as the temperature rose beyond that point.\nWith the red wax, I think I would only let young kids play with it at a table or desk. It is not particularly messy, but little bits of wax frequently come off when it is peeled off what ever it is stuck to, and I wouldn't want to risk young kids grinding it into my upholstery.\nHave Fun!

Unfortunately I live with my family in a two bedroom, Victorian era flat. There is always someone on the other side of a door or thin wall to annoy, especially at night or in the early morning. I need some way to practise more quietly at least some of the time. I don't want to spend much money as I may discover I hate classical guitar in a few months. There are four of options:\nBuy a cheap electric guitar and use a headphone amp. The problem with an electric is that it is metal stringed and has a different width neck. Also I really don't like the look, feel or sound of electric guitars - although you can get an amp to simulate an acoustic sound quite well if you pay for it.\nMuffle a classical guitar by filling the body. People have tried this. Here is a great video of it being done. Unfortunately it doesn't work well because much of the sound comes from the sound board itself vibrating rather than the hollow body amplifying it.\nBuy a Yamaha SLG200N. My favourite option but unfortunately they cost about \u00a3600 and I can't justify that. My budget is more like \u00a360. Maybe in a year or two ...\nBuild my own poor man's Yamaha SLG200N.

However, it's easier to work with the handle if you cut the grooves BEFORE rigging up the loop and washer (which I'll cover later in Step 3).]\nIf you feel on the inside of your PomGrip, you'll notice a slight ridge ringing the large opening on top. Start your cut just below this ridge and turn the handle with your other hand to make a shallow cut all the way around, then move the knife down about 1/16\" (roughly the width of that ridge ringing the top) and make another parallel cut all the way around. Once you have those two cuts, you can stick your knife into the top cut at an angle till it's almost flat against the inside of the Pom, then work it around to slice under that strip of silicone between the parallel cuts. You can use pliers to pull this strip out once you've mostly detached it with the knife.\nThis part requires some finesse if you don't want to totally shred your handle, so start slow and shallow and then cut deeper if need be.\nWhen you're finished, you should have a groove about 1/16\" wide going around the inside of each handle.

Once you've done it a few times, the whole battery-changing process should take 10-15 minutes per handle.]\nYou'll start by cutting four 8\" lengths of jewelry wire (two per handle). If you haven't already, take your poking device - I use sharp, thin tweezers - and poke four evenly-spaced holes in the center of the ridge ringing each light housing. Thread the wire in one hole and out an adjacent hole, pull so the ends are matched up in length, then grab both ends with the pliers and twist the wire down until there's a small triangular gap of about 1/2\" between the bottom of the twist and the housing.

As a kid it was one of my favorite times of the year, as it meant I got to hang out with my two favorite cousins and one other friend. One year we got the idea to build a simple wooded boat and attach some model rocket engines to it. We built the boat and launched it from the dock. That boat only went about 6 feet, but an annual tradition was born. Over the next few years we built several more boats - most were dismal failures. Eventually, my brother decided to have a go at building a boat and his boats were considerably more successful. We gradually increased the rocket thrust and even added a second rocket stage. Our most successful run made it around half way down the pond before the boat lifted off the water and tumbled out of control. This year I decided to build my first boat in quite some time - this is the story of that boat.", "title": "Rocket Boat", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Rocket-Boat/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "As our boats increased in speed over the years so did the problems we encountered in controlling them. We did find some key design elements that worked well though. First, we found that a flat bottomed boat was much faster than a deep hulled boat as the water drag was reduced in this configuration. We also found that the boat needed to be sufficiently long so that the rockets did not push the front of the boat down under the water. The boat was also found to have stability issues at speed if it had a large, flat, upward sloping front. As such a boat would reach maximum speed, the air flowing under the angled front of the boat would lift the front of the hull, tumbling the boat in a spectacular backflip.\nOn Youtube I found videos of high-speed outrigger-type RC boats, like that shown above. Impressed by the stability of these boats at speed, and realizing that they fit all of our key design elements, I drew up a simple design for my rocket boat. I printed out paper templates of the side profiles of the front of the hull as well as the outriggers.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FV2/DT8N/IUORPXVQ/FV2DT8NIUORPXVQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZD/99MZ/IUORPYS9/FZD99MZIUORPYS9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXP/U11J/IUORPXV8/FXPU11JIUORPXV8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Design"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "My boat was constructed of 3/32\" basswood and 1/32\" balsa. The basswood was used for the major structural components (sides of hulls, internal and external bulkheads), while the balsa was used for the top and bottom surfaces of the hull and outriggers.\nI temporarily glued two pieces of basswood together with Loctite-brand spray adhesive (blue type). The template for the front of the hull was affixed on top of these with spray adhesive. Next the shape of the hull sides was cut using a scroll saw. The scroll saw doesn't always make the straightest cuts, but basswood sands easily so any small imperfections in the cut can be easily erased.

In our example we\u2019ll create a simple 4-player \u201crace game\u201d where the general goal is to move a token to the end of a track. The steps to designing a fun, engaging set of rules are as follows:\n1. First, decide on the number of players that will be able to play your game at one time. This will determine the number of player tokens we need later.\n2. Next, decide on the length of the game \u2013 the harder it is to win, the longer the game will last. In this example, the number of tiles (\u201csteps\u201d a player token needs to cross) between the start and the finish should be 40 for a game that will probably last between 15 and 30 minutes. Tiles should be around 2 inches x 2 inches, larger if particularly important or with large amounts of text.\n3. Once the basic questions are out of the way, you need to decide what choices the players will have. This is what makes the game fun \u2013 players must be able to affect how the game plays out. In this example, we\u2019ll decide that some of the tiles will give players the ability to move enemy pieces or their own piece in specific ways, depending on the square.\n4. Next, decide how the game progresses. Does everyone move at the same time, or do they take turns? In our example game, we\u2019ll say that the game progresses one player\u2019s turn at a time, starting from the youngest player.\n5. One of our last steps is determining what a player can do on their turn \u2013 what\u2019s the list of actions a player can take? Furthermore, how do we decide the outcome of these actions? In our game, a player is simply allowed to roll the dice and move a number of squares equal to their roll on their own turn, as well as choose a unique outcome when they land on a square that gives them a choice.\n6. Finally, we need to determine the goal of the game \u2013 what are players trying to accomplish, and how do they win? When it comes to a simple race-game like ours, landing directly on the final tile is a simple win condition.\n7. Write all of the answers to these questions on a lined sheet of paper \u2013 these are the rules of your game.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6U/ALTV/IUORP5ED/F6UALTVIUORP5ED.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Creating the Rules"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "At this point, you can use the rules you\u2019ve created to design a game board \u2013 this is the field that the players will play the game on.\n1. The first step is to draw a board that corresponds to your rules, objective, and number of players. For a simple game like our example, draw out a path of 40 tiles and split it among 4 sheets of white paper, cut into squares with sides 7.25 inches long. Each of these sheets will correspond to a corner of the game board when printed. When preparing a larger game, increase the size of the squares of foam board you use to make the game board later to accommodate a larger play area.\n2. In about 25-40% of the tiles (in our case 12), write extra effects of your choosing. Some of these should provide the player with a choice of some sort, such as \u201cMove ahead 1 space or move another player back 2 spaces.\u201d This way, players feel they have a role in winning the game outside of lucky rolls of the dice.\n3. Once your board has been drawn, either take it to a print-shop or load it into your photo-copier and print the 4 sections onto 4 full-sheet labels.\n4. Cut out the board pieces from the label to make sure that the length matches the size of the game board, with a 0.25-inch margin between pieces to let the board fold easily. For example, if the board is in 4 squares with sides of 7.5 inches, make sure your labels are squares with sides of 7.25 inches to account for the margin.\n5.

Cut these squares out with a pair of scissors and lay them out, side by side.\n3. Take 2 of these squares and attach them to each other using a 7.5-inch-long piece of duct-tape, as shown in the image of the bottom of the board below.\n4. Flip these squares so that the non-taped side is facing upwards.\n5. Take a third square and line it up with the side of the first 2, creating a 90-degree angle.\n6.

Repeat steps 5 and 6 with the 4th square, lining it up at a 90-degree angle in the final remaining corner. At this point you should have one large square with one strip of tape on the bottom and two strips of tape on the top.\n8.

It is not something you do overnight and are successful (at least in my experience). As long as you are willing to put in the time, effort, and money then you can be proud no matter the outcome. Along with realizing your success will be based more on effort than anything, you need to realize your idea isn't some special flower.\nI always thought that an idea was a special gem that could be turned into an amazing thing given some work. As such there is this desire to protect it, keep it hidden and safe. This can not be the case here, unless you have a known name or have some kind of hook that will bring the people day one. If not, you need to get your product out in front of as many people as you possibly can as soon as you can.\nThe rest of this Instructable will show the amount of time, effort, money, and letting go of my idea to make it the best possible experience I can.\nYou can read more on my blog. I also relied heavily on the following people:\nJamey Stegmaier of Stonemaier Games\nJames Mathe of Minion Games\nThe Bamboozle Brothers\nRandy Hoyt of Foxtrot Games\nDisclaimers: This is my first Kickstarter, so time will tell how successful I actually am.

This forms the core of the game and everything flows from and is applied to.\nI may start with a cool theme or mechanic, but usually I am trying to solve a problem. This goes to my root of creativity. Find a problem and solve it. When trying to solve the problem the core forms around this root idea. These core concepts are little more than a bulleted list of items that are trying to solve the problem.\nI do this all before flushing out any mechanics, or putting together a prototype. But really it is a quick exercise that helps focus me. When creating prototypes and adding/removing mechanics I always refer back to my core list and see what should get added and what gets removed.\nOver time the core may adjust as I get feedback and test out different theories. For the most part they are minor tweaks, but could be bigger.\nFor Robit Riddle my root problem was getting my two sons, one a reluctant reader, the other a reluctant story teller, past these issues is a fun and engaging way. From that I came up with these core items:\nReading and story telling involved\nQuick to keep their attention (around 30 minutes as a bedtime story replacement)\nAges 6 or older while playing with older siblings or parents\nFun, silly, and engaging\nWin and lose together\nThe last item \"Win and lose together\" used to be \"Should not be able to fail\" was one of the original core items since my boys hate to fail, but this has changed as I got feedback from both my boys and other play testers.\nInitial Design\nFrom these core concepts, some mechanics came easily:\nEasy RPG with no Game Master using a Game Book\nRPG for story telling\nNo Game Master for win and loose together\nGame Book for reading, no game master, and quick play\nDice are engaging and add excitement\nCooperative play\nWin and lose together\nFun (my boys love coop vs competitive)\nNon-Human pre-made characters\nFun and silly can be done more easily in make-believe\nStory telling is easier when everything is already made up\nPre-made to keep the game quick\nFrom here I quickly put together a hand made prototype. In this case it was some character type sheets, some dice, and our imagination as I made up stories on the fly. Then I get much more serious if the idea has potential based on initial game plays.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9N/I50E/IU5N49EJ/F9NI50EIU5N49EJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: The Core: Initial Idea & Design"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Game design and development is all about going over an idea over and over again, making changes and improvements along the way. Really this is the same for any idea or project that I have worked on. Iteration is KING!\nThis was my first time making a board game that is going to be consumed by the public. As a rookie I needed to learn a lot that I didn't know I needed to learn. Some of these things that I had to learn were very tangible, like how to find play-testers, and what to do when I want to quickly test a new idea. Other learnings were more intangible, like some people could see an issue but not know how to fix it (that is my job), or some people tried to change what the game was. I had to learn what to do and what not to do. This meant I did things that I probably shouldn't have which wasted my time.\nRobit Riddle has gone through 16 different prototypes! Maybe this is normal, but seems like if I were to do another game I would have far fewer, which in turn would take much less time.\nTangible Lessons\nRubber Ducky\nTo test idea's quickly, get the idea down in a format where you can play-test with a bunch of rubber duckies (or stuffed animals, or fruits, or whatever you have laying around). This way you can work through the issue without having to spend time redesigning or getting it ready for play-tester consumption. This allows you to move much faster.\nFinding & Working with Play-testers\nPlay-testers are all around. Here are some things that I did to find them:\nGo to Meetup groups, both player and designer groups.\nEstablish a Meetup group for other designers if there already isn't one .\nGo to conventions both local and big if you can.\nReach out to friends & family.\nOnce you have solid rules you need to test your rulebook, for that you need blind play-testing. I would reach out to friends that were not local to me and ship them the game. This is a seriously important step and should not be skipped.\nYou can read more about working with play-testers here.\nIntangible Lessons\nIf something feels wrong, it probably is\nIf someone says something feels wrong it is at least worth exploring the thought\nBefore making changes always check the change to your core concepts and problem\nDo your best to only try one idea per iteration\nSomething is wrong\nSome things would nag in the back of my head that they were off. Sometimes this was confirmed by play-testers, other times I eventually ended up resolving it on my own. All of these times made the game that much better.\nKeep the Core Close\nIf I forgot to compare a change or fix to the core, I ended up in the weeds. It didn't matter where the idea came from (myself or play-testers) if it fit the core and made sense I tried it.\nFewer Changes\nIf I tried to change too many things at once they would get lost in the shuffle. To clearly see an idea through it helps to test it in isolation. This doesn't mean only make one change. It means change everything you need to to test the one idea.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBI/CKXY/ITW4HM4U/FBICKXYITW4HM4U.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW8/S4U5/IU5N4GKE/FW8S4U5IU5N4GKE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Iterating on Design"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The constant changes and long project lifecycle has been hard on my psyche at times. I needed to find ways to keep myself energized, especially when their are set backs. I had three goto things that I did when I felt myself slipping away.\nChanging My Focus\nSince it has been just me on the project, it allows switching between jobs. If I would get stuck on one thing I could easily change jobs.\nFor example I got stuck with some of the mechanics not flowing in Robit Riddle. Instead of letting that get me down I switched to making the base of the graphic design. Since I was going to have to change the mechanics at some point, I knew I was going to change the graphic design too, but this was acceptable as it got me unstuck.\nTaking it to the Public\nSubmitting Robit Riddle to a local game designer showcase focused my brain and my desire to see this thing get out into the public. I didn\u2019t even know if I was going to be accepted or not but I did notice my drive increased. Once my passion increased so did the quality of my game. It was becoming much more engaging.\nOnce i caught the bug from just submitting to a local showcase I started looking for more ways to reach the public. I signed up for conventions, especially ones that catered to up and coming designers/games.\nThe more I got it out there the better it got and the better I got with talking about it.\nArtwork\nIn board game design everyone says to hold off on art for your designs. While this rule should be followed in most scenarios (especially if you are not self-publishing), sometimes rules should be broken. Art can be very motivating.\nRobot Riddle started as just an idea that filled a hole in gaming that my family needed. After working on it for awhile, I knew I would try and bring it to market, but had no idea on a time frame. It is a very story driven game that I could picture in my mind. What I didn\u2019t have was a complete picture of what things would eventually look like.\nI went and hunted around DeviantArt for artists that style aligned with what I was looking for. I found a few and reached out to them. I had them do some quick sketches which I paid for. I did this to make sure we were compatible. Two of them lined up well. In the end most of the pieces were done by just one of them, John Ariosa. I was very lucky to stumble upon him.\nWhat I noticed though after getting the first pieces is it kept me motivated. I would come up with some story and the artist would send me concepts. Sometimes it would work in reverse, the artist sketching on some basic idea, and story would flow from their piece. This collaborative work flow helped even more.\nNot only was the art itself an inspiration for me, but the money was as well. I was spending money on my game. It made it that much more precious to me. It helped me stay resolved to bring this to market.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5W/VWHE/IU5N47Y4/F5WVWHEIU5N47Y4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAT/3V4M/IU5N48NC/FAT3V4MIU5N48NC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEJ/J0SR/IU5N48WE/FEJJ0SRIU5N48WE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA3/BEFK/IU5N4GMI/FA3BEFKIU5N4GMI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F93/525B/IU5N48X4/F93525BIU5N48X4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Motivation for the Long Haul"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "If you design and develop your game in a bubble you will get little to no support when it matters, no matter how good it is. So your job is not just trying to make the best game you can it is also getting that game out into the wild where people will get excited about it. There are several ways to accomplish this, starting with the easiest and cheapest and working out from there.\nFriendly Local Game Store (FLGS)\nThis should be your first point of contact. Depending on the store they will have different ways of being able to help you. These are the ways that my FLGS (Diversions) has helped me:\nAccess to local board game groups that play there.\nGiving a retailers perspective on games. Including:\nPricing (both MSRP and wholesale)\nShelf Presence (how box will be display)\nWhat games sell well and their opinion on why\nInformation about how game distribution works.\nStore Support\nIn store promotions with flyers\nStaff that talk about my game with others\nFeatured as a local designer on game days\nKickstarter backer\nFeedback on game as iterated\nLocal Game Groups\nSome of the groups meet at the FLGS, but some meet around town at different places like coffee shops or the local university. I will take my game to these places as well and playtest with the different groups. Not only does this help with getting good feedback about improving the game, but also allows more eyes on it. The more eyes and people getting excited about it, the more it will generate a buzz.\nConventions\nI have mentioned these before in the other steps, but they are important enough to mention again. I would start with going to local conventions. They are usually smaller and will cost you the least amount of money. It will get you a good amount of people that are in your demographic in a compressed timeframe.\nFrom here you can decide if your game is far enough along to go to the bigger conventions. They definitely cost more as you usually have to travel and get a place to stay. But there are huge benefits at the larger conventions.\nLast longer, so more people can see your game.\nHave more people, so more can see your game.\nDedicated spaces, for an even more targeted demographic.\nPossible press coverage, which opens up a whole new world.\nFor me an intangible for going to a big convention is that it makes things feel much more real to me. Like \"I am doing this!\" It is very exciting. Some of the larger conventions to go to are:\nGenCon: (My Coverage: Part 1, Part 2, Conclusion)\nOrigins\nPAX (all, but especially South for Table Top)\nEssen (Haven't been to)\nAmbassadors\nAll of the items above here (FLGS, Local Game Groups, and Conventions) lead to gorilla marketing. There will be some people that get so excited about your game that they actually work for you for free! They tell people about your game, they send people to your locations. These are your ambassadors, treat them well!\nAt one convention I had someone at another booth telling people about my game. Several people that came by told me about this person. Let me tell you, that felt AMAZING!\nPress Coverage\nWhen you start getting closer to your Kickstarter launch, you need to reach out to whatever media outlets you can. I try to do this as early as possible 4 to 6 months before your launch. Some are scheduling their coverage out that far. Some will ignore you, some will respond.\nTo get more to respond means do not send them some canned email. Take the time to look at what they do, and send a more personalized message. It will also have helped greatly if you meet them at a convention already.\nI also look for a variety of different sources that target different demographics. Some that have a more general audience, some that are specific to role playing games, some that cater to board gamers.\nOnce you have them you need to get them your game and support them in whatever means you can. Just be available.\nAdvertising\nThe last and one of the more costly is advertising. I have limited experience with this. I mention it as a thing I am going to do, but I don't really know how much it is going to pay off. Keep it in mind and try to find sources that will pay off for you. These can include:\nBoard Game Geek\nFacebook\nTwitter\nMedia sites", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FST/TIPK/ITW4HM50/FSTTIPKITW4HM50.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5D/HRLB/IU5N5DA2/F5DHRLBIU5N5DA2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Spread the Word"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Everything has led to this, the creation and launch of the Kickstarter. Not only is there a ton of work to design, develop, and promote the game, but also to prep everything for the Kickstarter.\nIn the Tabletop world of Kickstarter games people want to see your product. They want to know what you are going to deliver to them is something real, and that real something is going to be amazing. You cannot go into this with some rough concepts a generic looking prototype and maybe an example of the art.\nThe previous steps should make sure that you have what you need as far as the game goes and hopefully a following too. Outside of that there are many things that are specific to the Kickstarter that need to be done. This in itself could be a whole series of articles, but I will briefly cover each based on timing.\nReviews\nThese might have the longest lead time, but you also have to have a mostly complete game to send them. Balancing act. Reviews of your product will add validation to it. They will assure the people backing the game that there is something real and they can trust that you have spent the time to make it fairly complete.\nStretch Goals\nThe reason these are the next thing is because so many other steps require at least some understanding of what is going to go in the box. You don't need to figure out all the stretch goals, but you do need a good idea. You don't want to decide to put heavy metal coins in the box after you have already figured out your shipping costs.\nManufacturing\nIn order to know how much the game will retail for you need to know how much it is going to cost to make. This should take into account both with and without stretch goals. Get quotes from a few different sources, especially if you do not know how many you are going to need.\nThe rule of thumb is that it should be 5 times what your cost is to get it shipped to you or a distributor. Also talk with the retailer to make sure your game can warrant the price you are looking to charge.\nShipping\nI think this is the most complicated part leading up to the Kickstarter. If you are going to do world wide shipping it gets even more complicated. Books could probably be written on this subject (and probably are). Decide if you are going to ship everything from your location or if you are going to find distributors around the world. Then adjust your shipping costs accordingly.\nVideo\nThe Kickstarter must have a video. If you are doing the video yourself make sure it looks have way decent. It doesn't have to be slick or even all that professional, but it must have a hook. Something that will energize the watchers. It should also convey what your game is about.\nHow to Play\nThis can be a video or a quick bit of text and graphics or both. But let people know that this thing is real.\nWhat the Game Comes With\nThis is little more than a components list, but again it lets people know that this thing is real. It also allows them to internalize a value for your game.\nInfo About You & Team\nGive some background about yourself, why you are doing this, and why it is important. Show your progress of the game.\nConclusion\nThere is a ton that goes into bringing a game to Kickstarter. Do not go into it thinking this is going to be easy, everyone is doing it. I didn't even cover the running of, or the after funding. Those I can talk about after my campaign is a huge success!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDG/GY4M/ITW4HM4R/FDGGY4MITW4HM4R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU6/ELEK/IUKF201G/FU6ELEKIUKF201G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPS/RRHP/IUKF201J/FPSRRHPIUKF201J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1R/KH12/IUKF202A/F1RKH12IUKF202A.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Holy Logistics!"}], "channel": "Table Top"}, {"category": "Play", "description": "Here is \"MR:NONE\", the Art Toy you can print and customable.

As a new father and avid gamer living in a small apartment with my wife and daughter, I was looking for an affordable and space saving alternative to traditional miniatures. I came across a paper miniature site and was inspired. I had some Shrinky Dink film leftover from an old art project and decided to give it a try. Other than the shrink film you might not have much to buy to make these yourself. I will start with the art supplies I used to complete this project.\nFirst, comes the shrink film. To my knowledge, there are two manufacturers of shrink film. Grafix which you can pick up from Amazon, and possibly some art supply stores. They have a pretty wide selection of finishes from clear to matte and sanded. I have not tried this brand yet but I plan on trying it out on my next figure. The other option and the one I used for this instructable is Shrinky Dink. I picked mine up at my local Michaels. Shrinky Dink also has a couple of different finishes, for this project I used the Ruff n\u2019 Ready, it has a rough frosted texture which holds on to color really well. Both brands offer inkjet printable options, which I imagine would save a lot of time and effort, but I have not tried those yet, I have plans for those as well.\nA note on clear options, the frosted ruff and ready option I use is translucent even after baking. The clear option looks like stained glass. So keep this in mind when purchasing your shrink film. The clear would probably work really well for gelatinous cubes, invisible stalkers, oozes and the like.", "title": "Shrinky Dink D&D Miniatures", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Shrinky-Dink-DD-Miniatures/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "For the drawing, I used my favorite mechanical pencil. Nothing fancy just a basic .5mm. For outlines, I used the black Faber-Castell Pitt pens. An XS for faces and other super fine details, and an S for most everything else. As for coloring in the artwork, I went with markers. On a previous figure, I used Prismacolor pencils which are great. But I noticed I had to be careful with the outlines. The colored pencils had a tendency to cover up the outlines.\nI wanted to use the markers I already had in the house, leftovers from old college art classes, but I just didn\u2019t have enough color options. So I went out and picked up some Crayola Super Tips. These are the washable water-based type. These actually worked pretty well. Being water based on a plastic surface, they didn\u2019t dry very fast so I was able to do some blending.

Since I am really into music and am looking at doing something with it as a carrier choice, I wanted my Personal Project to be about music. At that time, in music class we were doing a unit on world music and as a joke, I said I would build a kora (more on what exactly a kora is later) for my Personal Project. Of course, that ended up not being a joke and I actually decided to make one.\nThe kora\nThe kora is a west African string instrument which, according to the reliable source Wikipedia, is classified as a \"double-bridge-harp-lute\" because it fits into all those characteristics. It consists of 21 strings and is incredibly hard to play. Hear one of the best kora players of today, Toumani Diabete, play my favourite kora song in the YouTube video attached.\nA kora typically consists of:\n21 strings (nylon or traditionally, strips of hide)\nCalabash for a body\nGoat skin top\nBridge (hardwood)\nNeck (hardwood)\nTuning rings/pegs (machine heads, fiddle tuning pegs, zither pins or traditionally, leather rings)\nHook (eye bolt or traditionally, an iron ring)\nNow, for the sake of making my project more interesting (and because the cost of making a real kora in the Netherlands is a little extreme), my kora is made of mostly second-hand materials and build in a non traditional method. Essentially, the aim is to create a kora which retains the physical shape (for the most part) but with easily accessible, cheap materials.\nOne last thing; all my measurements, inspiration and a few of the adaptions to traditional kora building are credited to Dennis Havlena, an instrument maker whom I found online. You can find his website (which has some really cool stuff) here.", "title": "Making an Affordable, Easy Kora", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Making-an-Affordable-Easy-Kora/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "For this project you are going to need a number of things.\nA body\nThis can be of any shape really but I would recommend either a hemisphere, a cuboid or a cylindrical container\nIt must be hollow and not have a lid\nIdea: If, however, you opt to go for a box which has some kind of fitting lid (cookie tin, for example) you can use this instead of the skin replacement mentioned below. Just make sure it's stable. Also, it means you won't need glue (it'll hold itself)\nThe length or diameter of the front side should be between 30 and 40 cm (11.8 and 15.5 in)(mine is 38 cm)\nTip: Consider the fact that it is being used as the body for a instrument and thus it must resonate sound in an efficient manner\nTip: Do some scourging at a second hand store and see what useful things you can find\nExamples\nWooden bowl\nHard plastic container/bucket\nTin box (cookie tin etc.)\nA gourd (just like a traditional kora)\nMetal lampshade (this is what I used. I found it at a junk store)\n2 handles\nThey should be long enough to cover the front of kora and then some (at least 5 cm I would say)(see photo from Dennis Havlenas plykora above)(mine are 50 cm long)\nMake sure they are a good size for you to grip with your three back fingers (pinkie, ring and middle)\nTip:When you are looking for suitable objects consider reusing old handles (e.g. broom sticks)\nExamples\nBroom stick (I used one which a friend gave me)\nWooden dowel rods\nDrum sticks (I have a lot of those lying around...)\nSuitable sticks (I would recommend you sand these extensively)\nPlastic rods/sticks\nThin plywood strips\nOne large eye bolt\nThink that 21 strings need to be tied to it\n0.3 cm (1/8 in) thick wood sheet of which the length and width is equal to the diameter or the length and width of the front of your body\nThis will replace the skin of the kora but if you can get your hands on some, by all means, go ahead just be aware that I do not include instructions on how to attach it to the body and that a weaker body (like my land shade) might not be able to hold that kind of pressure. Go to dennishavlena.com for advice on using skin if you decide that that is indeed the way you want to go\nNeck\nA wooden beam of approx. 5 x 7.6 cm (2 x 3 in) for the small side. This is how I did mine but traditionally, they are 2.54 x 2.54 cm (1 x1 in). If you are using any kind of tuning pegs other than my design, use the 1 in neck. The length has to be calculated based on the diameter/length of your body. Seeing as the bridge is 94.4 cm (37.1 in) down the neck and it should be approx. in the middle/top of the body, the length of the neck should be 94.4 cm + 1/2 the length of the body +10 cm. This is a little different to the way in which I measured the length of my neck but this is more accurate and also very similar to the way I did it. My neck is 132.4 cm (52.13 in)\nRemember, it's better (in this case) for the neck to be too long as opposed to too short\n0.6 cm (1/4 in) thick piece of wood measuring 230 x 52 mm (9.06 x 2.05 in)\nThis will be the bridge piece as well as its brace\nA small piece of card of 7 x 7.6 cm (2.76 x 3 in)\nA small piece of wood of 12.5 x 13 x 0.6 cm (4.92 x 5.12 x 0.25 in)\nThis will become the other bridge piece\nStrings\nI found this the hardest material to source. Your strings should be made of nylon or something very, very similar. The thinner gauges are the easiest to find and can be sourced at a fishing equipment store. For the thicker gauges you may have to look online or in a gardening tool shop (they use nylon with thick gauges for weed whip which is probably the best thing to use)\nBe aware that these lengths will leave you with a lot of excess string\nYou will need\n1 x 2 m of 0.45 mm (0.018 in) fishing line\n2 x 2 m of 0.51 mm (0.020 in) fishing line\n2 x 2 m of 0.59 mm (0.022 in) fishing line\n1 x 2 m of 0.61 mm (0.024 in) fishing line\n4 x 2 m of 0.74 mm (0.029 in) fishing line\n6 x 2 m of 0.79 mm (0.031 in) fishing line\n1 x 2 m of 1.02 mm (0.040 in) weed whip\n2 x 2 m of 1.27 mm (0.050 in) weed whip\n1 x 2 m of 1.65 mm (0.065 in) weed whip\n1 x 2 m of 2.41 mm (0.095 in) weed whip\nTuning pegs\nNow this is a tricky one. For those who can afford them, let alone find them, I strongly recommend getting 21 zither pins as they really are the best choice (Dennis Havlena has good instructions on installing these). Also, the use of zither pins means that the neck has to be 5 x 2.54 cm (1.97 x 1 in). You could also opt for machine heads but these are even more expensive and some of the neck measurements may need to be redone (also keep in mind that the thinner the neck gets, the stronger the wood needs to be; 21 strings creates a lot of tension!). I (for the sake of making my project more creative (and because it's cheaper), designed my own tuning pegs and will be including instructions on making and installing them.\nFor my tuning pegs you will need\n21 6 mm (0.21 in) wing nuts\n21 6 x 16 mm (0.21 x 0.61 in) eye bolts\n21 6 x 80 mm (0.21 x 3.15 in) machine screw (the kind with the flat bottom)\n21 8 x 40 mm (0.24 x 1.57 in) plastic expansion anchors\nSome super glue\nSome strong tape (duct tape is probably best but I used electric tape and it's holding just fine)\nIf you find a better design, show me by leaving it in the comments below\nSome type of thick, spreadable glue\nSome wax for the neck and the handles (optional)\nSome good music to chill to\nSome tools you might need (not necessarily) include\nAccess to a laser cutter (you can do by hand but I used a laser cutter)\nAccess to a hand saw or an electric saw\nA pen and/or a pencil\nA drill (a pillar drill is even better) with some drill bits\nA metal cutter (if you plan on using an aluminium lamp like me)\nSand paper/sanding machine/belt sander\nSuper important note\nWhen I started writing this, I had not yet completed the project. However, since then, not only have I finished the project, but I have noticed that there are some extremely important flaws with my tuning pegs. Due to this, my kora has been rendered to a fancy looking project of which some strings play and some don't. I strongly recommend the use of the 1 in neck and the zither pin tuning pegs mentioned above and as shown by Dennis Havlena. The instructions for my tuning pegs will remain here (for the sake of my school project). I'm sorry if this makes interpreting these instructions any harder. Note that if you do end up going to Dennis Havlena's page for instructions of the zither pins, you will also be needed 21 nails (not too fussy on what type or anything, see dennishavlena.com) and that my instructable still includes a lot of handy tips that Dennis Havlena doesn't really explain.\nBecause this instructable is still relevant for using the zither pins, I shall state at the beginning of each step whether the step is still usable (Usable), needs to be adapted (size-wise and such)(Needs adapting) or no longer applicable at all (N.A.).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAF/71OP/ITD3WJ7Y/FAF71OPITD3WJ7Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMX/L2WS/ITD3WHPO/FMXL2WSITD3WHPO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5A/FRR5/ITHKMJN7/F5AFRR5ITHKMJN7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ7/MP3L/ITD3WHWC/FJ7MP3LITD3WHWC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Grab Your Materials"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Needs adapting: Size of card should be 7 x 2.54 cm (2.76 x 1 in)\nFor the body, you will be marking where you need the two holes for the neck, drilling a hole through the body in one corner of the future hole and then using either an electric saw, a hand saw or (in my case) a metal cutter to make the holes.

Make sure the drill bit you use is big enough to allow you to use the tool of your choice to cut later on. For example, with the electric saw, make sure the hole you create is large enough to accommodate the blade. Also, make sure you drill the hole in such a way that the hole does not go outside the lines drawn on earlier.\nUse your tool to cut out the hole. If necessary drill more holes when you reach the other corners (in the event that it isn't possible to turn. Try to be relatively accurate when cutting but don't get too worried about cutting it a little too big or inaccurately because these errors are ones which can be corrected by glue to stick it into the neck (which I recommend doing even if you get the size just right) and by sanding or just more cutting if it's too small.\nCut any bits that still need cutting and give any rough edges a good sand.\nRepeat for the second hole\nFor those of you adding a sound hole, you should repeat the process of cutting the neck holes but in a very similar manner.

You could do this using a belt sander, a sanding machine or even a manual sanding block but this would take en extremely long amount of time. I used a stationary bandsaw available at school to cut this as it was quick and easy.\nThe piece of wood which is to become the front must be the same shape and have the same dimensions as the open side of your body. Due to the fact that I have access to a laser cutter at school, I used this very useful tool to cut my wood into the front I needed. Because my body's soundhole was a little small, I decided it was best to include two small sounds holes at the front. You may choose to do the same. I have included my laser cutting files (SketchUp) including those of the bridge and brace in case you have access to a laser cutter and wish to use them (note that rescaling may be necessary for the front). If laser cutting is not an option for you, you may wish to use a saw (electric or manual) to do so.\nThe whole bridge piece consists of 3 individual pieces; the bridge itself, the brace and the piece giving it height and, traditionally, adding some protection to the skin. The The latter piece should already be to size as it is included in the materials list. Lets call it the raiser. For the brace and bridge, I really recommend laser cutting if possible because it simplifies things. Note that the slits to slide them together (like a 3D paper christmas tree) are a little too small in the laser cutting files. Also, the slits for the strings must be expanded by sanding or scraping with a knife. For those with no access to a laser cutter, again, I suppose you must do it by hand. See the above photo for some measurement details (provided by Dennis Havlena).\nAssemble the bridge\nBegin by slotting the bridge and the brace together so as to create a \"+\" sign at the bottom. If they do not fit snugly, add a little bit of thick glue so as to keep them really solid.\nThen, find the center of the raiser and stick the center of the bridge to this point using the thick glue.\nPutting the front together\nFind the centerline of the front as in the photo above and then measure 9.5 cm (3.74 in) down that line from the top of the front. Mark this spot with a little line as in the photo.\nMeasure a line of 10.8 cm (4.25 in) and a line of 8.9 cm (3.5 in) at the bottom as in the photo.\nPlace the center of the raiser (including everything stuck to it) on the spot marked in the step 3.1 and draw around so you know where to stick. Make sure the bridge piece itself (the one with the slots for the holes) is facing upwards (when held upright)\nPlace the handles so that they intercept edge of both lines (left handle on the left edges, right on the right) and trace around them so you know where to glue. Make sure the handle bit (where you grab) is pointing up.\nNow apply the thick glue to the bottom of the raiser and place it in the lines you traced earlier. Make sure the side of the bridge piece with 11 slots is on the LEFT when looked at from the front! I actually made the mistake of sticking it on the wrong way and thus having to cut an extra slot by hand. Not fun...\nWait a bit.\nRepeat step 3.5 but then for the handles. This should result in the completion of the front.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFO/UV8P/IU7AKU0O/FFOUV8PIU7AKU0O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8O/N3MS/IU7AKVVI/F8ON3MSIU7AKVVI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS7/GWYS/IU7AKX8Z/FS7GWYSIU7AKX8Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Z/L9F4/IU8PZ14S/F1ZL9F4IU8PZ14S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F79/Q2X4/IU8PZ1FZ/F79Q2X4IU8PZ1FZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPE/775H/IU8PZ2I4/FPE775HIU8PZ2I4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVQ/UIRY/IU8PZ5I1/FVQUIRYIU8PZ5I1.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Front"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Needs adapting: The measurements still apply\nOnce you have acquired the piece of wood necessary for the neck specified in the materials list, all you have to do it drill 21 hole (that sounds worse than it is) and make a few markings for later.

Make sure that the drill bit you use is just a tiny bit smaller than the screws that will be used for the tuning pegs. This is really important as otherwise, the pegs will turn when the string is on as the hole will not be tight enough. In the event that the hole is too big (as mine are), you can use nails to keep the pegs from turning as in photo.\nIf you'd like to give it a wax, this would be the ideal time.\nNext, measure the height of your body from the point drawn in step 3 and make a mark anywhere under that.

Do this by laying the kora down in front of you (on your lap works well) and holding the roll of nylon a fist away from the large eye bolt. Pull the other side over the top of the bridge and pinkie length past the tuning peg in question. Cut with scissors. You may be left with some excess string.\nNext, tie one end of the string to the large eye bolt using the same knot used to tie nylon guitar strings to the bridge. Dennis Havlena recommends the fisherman's double clinch knot but I found this too complicated and not all that more efficient. Besides, I was already familiar with the knot for nylon guitar strings. There are many videos on the internet on how to make this knot and it is a really simple knot which you will never forget once you do it the first time.\nOnce tied, pull the string through the dedicated slit in the bridge (some filing may be necessary if the slot is not big enough to accommodate the string.\nNow, pull the string through the intended little eye bolt and bring it through the gap in the plastic expansion anchor. See the image for any odd terminology.\nIn the case of the string slipping, pull the string through the gap and tuck it under the flap. You will most likely have to do this. Also, this only works for the fishing line and the 1.02 mm weed whip as the other weed whip is just too thick. To avoid slippage from these wrap some strong tape around the top of the anchor so as to hold it shut and not allow the string to escape. Surprisingly, this works well.\nNow you can turn the tuning peg. Turn until it is fairly tight. Worry about tuning later.\nIf (due to drilling holes too big) your pegs are slipping, use the nail method I mentioned in an earlier step to stop this from happening. It makes tuning very difficult as the nail must be removed every time but at least it keeps the tuning peg in place.\nDo this for all 21 strings and your homemade kora is complete!\nTip: Don't turn so much that the plastic expansion anchor is touching the neck as this could possibly break the superglue bonds between the anchor and the screw. If it's getting too close, take off the string, move the peg and put the same string back on (so don't cut it).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFY/JFTV/IU8WEI8P/FFYJFTVIU8WEI8P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2G/R8EC/IU8WEO9R/F2GR8ECIU8WEO9R.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Stringing the Kora"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "Now that it's all strung up, you actually own a full size kora.

This means that you don't need to install a special surround for the effect to work and the audience can get fairly close without discovering the trick.\nOf course the compromise is that the table then appears to have five legs (one in each corner and one in the middle). It makes the table look a little strange, but this is what we are after anyway.

The top end electric machines cost >$1000 and the middle range machines start at around $700. What these two upper-classes of machines have in common is they are floor standing machines. The low end machines, like I got, are only ~$180 but do not include a stand. Stringing a racquet on a table top is a bit cumbersome, and floor models are much more comfortable. Before this stand I would place my tabletop machine on some wood and a couple of saw horses. While this works, it is an inelegant solution. An Instructable was clearly calling out to me -- so here it is! I built my stand with fairly simple tools and spent around $80. I could have spent less, but I wanted to produce something with decent design margin and longevity.", "title": "Gamma Progression 200 Racquet Stringer Stand", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Gamma-Progression-200-Racquet-Stringer-Stand/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The first task is to make a base for the machine itself. I decided to make a contoured base from oak. I chose oak because I didn't want the base to warp. But, honestly, if I were to do this over again, I would use a cheaper piece of wood and not cut a contoured shape, i.e., leave the base as a rectangle. I think a good piece of 3/4\" birch plywood would suffice. Having a simple rectangular base is easier/faster to build and, if over-sized a little, creates space to store additional tools. Live and learn...\nThere are 4 screw holes on the bottom of the Gamma Progression 200 stringer base. These are 8mm (1.25mm thread pitch) holes. The task is to mark the relative location of these holes on the wood base. I had some short 5/16\" carriage bolts, and I managed to get those to grab the first couple threads. I placed a small dab of poster tack material on the center of each carriage bolt and pressed the stringer bottom onto the wood base. You could also probably use a wax pencil or even lipstick (tool chest, 2nd drawer down on the right...). The tacky blobs eventually stuck to the wood, identifying the drill hole locations. Center punch these locations and drill ~10mm (11/32\" if you mark the locations carefully, 3/8\" if not) holes in 4 places.\nInsert four 8mm bolts into the holes and temporarily attach the stringer bottom. Trace the outline of the bottom on the wood base and use a jig saw to cut a contoured base. Again a countoured base is nice, but I would leave the wood base rectangular if I had to do it over again. Use a plane and coarse sandpaper to take down the \"high\" spots around the perimeter of the base. Fine sand the entire base and add a couple coats of urethane.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FS6/N65C/IT02DQCF/FS6N65CIT02DQCF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN3/1AY8/IT02DQCH/FN31AY8IT02DQCH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6U/FS40/IT02DQD1/F6UFS40IT02DQD1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8P/PPK7/IT02DQDN/F8PPPK7IT02DQDN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Make the Base"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I knew I wanted to use a 2-1/2\" galvanized post (made for chain link fences) as the stand riser, so I needed something to attach the post to. I found some chain link fence post floor flanges online for about $12 each. We need two.\nNext we need to find the location to mount the flange on the wood base, and this location must be the Center of Gravity (CoG) of the entire stringing machine + wood base. Mount the stringer bottom onto the wood base using the 8mm bolts again and completely assemble the stringer top. The entire stringer mass and mass distribution needs to be used, since we want the post to be centered directly below this point. To find the CoG, balance the complete stringer + wood base assembly on the thin edge of a piece of scrap wood; I used a 1/2\" wide piece of scrap wood. Mark with a little masking tape the two locations where the scrap wood extends to the wood base. Draw a light pencil line (or tape some string) between these two points to form a line. Rotate the scrap wood ~90 degrees and find the new balance position. Again mark the two locations where the scrap wood meets the edge of the wood base and connect the two points to form a second line. Where the two lines intersect is the approximate CoG. To test your CoG work, center the flange at the CoG and balance the entire stringer assembly + wood base on the flange; it should balance. You can short-cut this CoG process by using a \"guess and check\" method to hunt down the CoG: just keep moving the flange around until you find where the stringer assembly balances.\nTo mount the flange on the base I used 1/4\" dia. x 1.25\" long lag screws. The holes in the flange are huge: like 3/4\", so I had to use two washers to cover the hole: 1/4\" and 5/16\", and I used a nylon spacer in the hole itself to center the lag screw. You probably can get away with not using nylon spacers, but they are only about 50 cents each. Drill the proper sized pilot holes for 1/4\" lag screws for the wood type you used in your base.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYP/WDSM/IT02DQMG/FYPWDSMIT02DQMG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFW/GXWX/IT02DQKG/FFWGXWXIT02DQKG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL2/YC8B/IT02DQL2/FL2YC8BIT02DQL2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFC/Q3KY/IT02DQO4/FFCQ3KYIT02DQO4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Mounting the Post Flange"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I used a 2\"x3\" piece of pine and cut two 30\" lengths.

I planed-down and sanded the top edges of each piece of wood but only about 8\" in from each end. This produced a rounded top part of the wood toward the outer edges. I added a couple coats of urethane. Do not urethane where the halving joints overlap -- these need to be glued.\nUse wood glue to join the two pieces and form the cross base. Halving joints do not have much torsional strength, so I attached a couple 6\" 'L' brackets with #12 wood screws for stability. Place the second 'L' bracket on the side opposite the first.\nTest-fit the second post flange on the center of the cross base and mark the hole locations.

I took it apart, discarded the body and the electronics and disabled the steering then fastened everything to a wooden base slightly smaller than the casket base.

This means the parts fit together snugly straight out of the machine.\nThere are a few ways to get the images onto a wooden cut jigsaw puzzles.\nYou can transfer colour images onto the surface wood using a technique like this one, or the laser cutter is capable of engraving a greyscale image onto the surface of the material. Once the image is drawn then it is a simple matter to cut the jigsaw into tight pieces. I took a sample section of jigsaw puzzle from wikimedia, this was already in a suitable vector format, ripe for cutting.\nI can't believe I hadn't made a jigsaw on my laser before this challenge, the whole thing only took a few minutes to prepare and it can be infinitely customisable with whatever image you want on your puzzle.

Inkscape has a function that allows you to easily trace images, they just needed a bit of cleaning up and they were ready to cut. I put the names onto the board using Hershey Text which is quick to cut and looks good. (I realise my tray is wrongly labelled but I corrected it in the file I'm sharing here)\nMore complicated tray puzzles usually involve you putting a number of shapes into a single hole and trying to find a way to get them all to fit.

I used a digital version I created previously. Once the knot work was drawn I was able to break it down into the constituent parts. In the construction image you can see I curved the ends of puzzle pieces, this creates a closed area for each puzzle piece which can then be coloured to make it much easier to show which part goes where.

I have an 80W machine and it will cut material 12mm thick, this is large enough to create a stick and because the sticks are square once they have been cut in one axis you can rotate the stick 90 degrees and cut the second axis.\nThe first Burr shown here consists of 12 identical parts each with a notch in the middle on the second axis. I chose to do the single notch on the second pass because the stick will move slightly as you rotate it. When you cut the stick you need to cut the profile but you also need to clear out to the rest of the hole so you can put it back in sideways. The file attached here will look odd because it is for a single piece and there are two parts to the drawing, one for each pass.\nThere is a subsection of Burr puzzles that make up the Chuck Family. I've always liked this puzzle. In it's simplest form it's incredibly common, the kind that you would find in Christmas crackers but you can elongate some of the pieces and start to make longer and bigger versions of the chuck. Then you can form pyramids and cubes and all sorts of shapes. It's a bit like a construction set as long as you have enough of the right pieces (it's a good job I can laser cut exactly what I need).

You could also put any kind of picture you want on the top of the blocks.\nEach block is made up of 3 different layers, the middle layer is shifted right and up slightly to form an overlapping section with the block next to it. Where the tiles overlap the surfaces have been engraved, this reduces the thickness of the material and makes it slide easily in the gaps. The edge of the puzzle also have 3 layers which is staggered in a similar fashion. The edge is backed like the other tray puzzles and this stops the pieces from falling out of the middle. The edge is a single solid piece, because of this the last row of blocks has to be glued into place inside the puzzle so be careful not to spread the glue outside the block or it won't slide correctly.\nBecause this puzzle is just a series of blocks it could be expanded to any dimension and size you requires.

The trick is that the hoop is never really on the string in the first place and by carefully moving things around you can free the various parts required to solve the puzzle. These puzzles were made specifically for this instructable competition and were inspired by some of the other puzzles being entered.\nThe first puzzle is a classic, again something you would find in Christmas crackers to pass away the hours waiting for the turkey to go down. The two pieces are entangled by their strings and form complete loops which can't be separated. Except they don't really, the string can be fed through the hole and over the disk. When you pull it back through the hole the two parts are separated (or double looped if you went the wrong way). The string is captured in the material by using 3 layers of wood and sandwiching it together over a knot.\nPuzzle 2, the hoop is on one loop of the string and the goal is to move it over to the other side. It's a simple puzzle and if you just start winding the hoop along the string in the right direction it quickly becomes apparent how to make it jump from one side to the next.\nPuzzle 3 requires you to free the hoop from the bottom of the tower. Note how the hoop isn't actually entangled in the string. You'll also note that the bead is able to fit through the hoop and the disks can fit through the tower.

I think it's something that is often overlooked, if the designer were to change the size of some joints over others you could end up with a slight puzzle box but more importantly something that couldn't be assembled wrongly.

There are 12 identical parts which all click together. This is one puzzle where it's best to get hands on and just figure out where each bit goes. The trick is getting the twelfth piece into the mix. The solution is to build the model at two separate parts. Five pieces click together to form one corner which should be built around a sixth piece. Once the corner is built you can clip the sixth piece into the others on all 5 of it's points. Repeat that with the rest of the puzzle pieces and then while holding the two completed corners bring the two halves together, interlocking the remaining arms as you do so.

Her toy animal collection by now is 57 animal toys and counting. By the time I finish this project, that number will probably be much higher. Our favorite TV channel is NatGeo Wild and we watch it together when we can. Since she likes to play with her toy animals, it seemed that the only logical step for me is to make a certain habitat for the toys. I wanted it to be big enough, to be sturdy enough and toxic free, from mainly natural materials.\nSince the number of Africa dwelling animals is the highest in her collection, I will start with that. I wanted to make a suitable \u201ctoy\u201d for a two year old, not to spend too much, and use as much material from my household.\nSo, let\u2019s get started.\nFirst of all this is a long and repetitive process, so if you are in a hurry, don\u2019t even start it.\nMaterials and tools:\nbase (I used plywood)\nStyrofoam (fine granulated)\ntoilet paper (TP)\npaper towels (PT)\nold newspaper\nscissors\npliers\nwire (I used copper)\nPVA glue (water based)\nblowtorch (optional)\nknife\nAccu drill (optional)\nbrushes\nmasking tape\nfine granulated sand (quartz sand)\nwood putty (acrylic)\nprimer (acrylic)\npaints (acrylic)\n\n\n* This tutorial is almost the same as the one uploaded in PDF", "title": "African Savannah Diorama", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/African-Savannah-Diorama/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Firstly I have to apologize for not taking photos of first three steps.

I used PVA glue (or any kind of wood glue will do nicely) because Polychloroprene based glues will dissolve styrofoam.\nCut the excess of styro from the base. Just use a sharp knife, or check STEP 3.\nI wanted for my African Savannah to have a \u201cLion King-ish\u201d look, therefore the rock formation on one side.\nCut the styro to form a base and then advance upwards.\n\nHelpful thing is adding toothpicks between the layers of styro to keep them in place.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDY/QH02/ISYN1EBX/FDYQH02ISYN1EBX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOI/IODQ/ISYN1ECT/FOIIODQISYN1ECT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: PART 1: DIORAMA"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "When you arrange the rock formation, weigh it down.

As I mentioned in the intro, this toy habitat needs to be sturdy. With PVA glue and layers of paper (or paper mac-he) you can achieve that rigidity and sturdiness. For those of you who never did paper mac-he here are a few guidelines: Since paper is mostly cellulose, and wood is cellulose, PVA (or any wood glue) works perfectly with paper. The trick is to soak the paper in glue and then adding another layer, and another, and another, and another.....you get the picture. I found out through trial and error that the best paper for first layer and the best paper for modeling shapes is TP because of its\u2019 high soaking power. So it\u2019s not necessary to soak it up in glue first. Just apply the glue (actually, a mixture of 1:3 of PVA and water works perfectly) to the surface and put the paper on top. Then you can model the paper according to the surface. The tricky part is The Rock (sorry Dwayne Johnson) . Just remember to keep the paper soaked and model it with brushes.

You need some kind of support for later modeling, I decided to go with copper wire which I twirled (described in the STEP). Ok, so just form some sort of parabola from the exit point to the bottom of the waterfall. Just puncture a hole and don\u2019t be stingy on the wire length. The more you stick it in the styro, the more it will hold. And you get to test the hardness of your previous layers by puncturing the holes.\n\nNow I had to form a waterfall.

When dry (in about an hour) it made a nice texture for further plans.\nAlthough the Sandy Paste did its\u2019 thing, I still wasn\u2019t satisfied, so I wanted to add some extra texture to the whole thing. Oh, you\u2019ve noticed the trees? I will describe the process for making the trees later. Anyway, what you need next is fine sand (any color since it\u2019s gonna be painted anyway) and our well known ally PVA and water mix, only make it 1:1 ratio. You want to make the sand stick (and hold) to the base. So, just pour the mix, even it out with brush or spatula, and sprinkle sand over it. Try to sprinkle it from at least half a meter above since it will disperse more evenly and it will stick better to the mix.\nSo, the trick is: where there\u2019s glue - the sand will stick and you will get texture. After it\u2019s half dried, you can tip over the whole thing to get the excess of the sand of, or you can rotate it on its\u2019 sides and tap it from below. You need to get rid of extra sand otherwise it will be everywhere. Note that this diorama is meant for indoors. So, after getting rid of extra sand, you can fill in any spots that you\u2019ve missed (if any). If you\u2019re repeating the process, remember to get rid of extra sand again.

Just drop a few drops of your darkest blue (I use Vallejo model colors) in the middle. Then, using your brush, smudge it around a bit. Start adding a lighter shade of blue, adding water sou you can blend the two shades together. Repeat until the whole water hole is painted.\nNext, I painted the slopes of the water hole for same reasons I did the water hole first. It has to look like trodden mud, so grab some brown color, 2 or 3 shades and paint the darkest first. Add some smudges with your brush and there you have it.

As I said on the sart of this project, I wanted to do everything, well, almost everything with the stuff that\u2019s avaliable at every household. So here are the tools that I used. A drill isn\u2019t neccessary, but it gets the job done pretty quickly. As you can see, these are basic tools, pliers, brushes, masking tape, a piece of wooden rod,wire, and our dear friend: PVA glue.\nSTEP 1: get some inspiration on the trees. I just googled \u201cbaobab\u201d.\nSTEP 2: Depending on the size of the tree, you need to cut a lenght of wire. As you can see, this one is about 30cm long, and this will be the tallest tree on the diorama. Cut 5 pieces of approximately the same lenght, it doesn\u2019t really matter if you miss an inch, or 2.54 cm.\nSTEP 3: Fold each piece in half and place the folded end into the drill. Hold the loose ends of the wire with pliers and turn on the drill. SLOWLY at first, you can increase the speed as the wire twines.. Just keep it gonig and you will end with nice twined wire that looks like this:\nI used copper wire which I\u2019ve salvaged from an old electro motor from an old washing machine, but any kind of not too rigid wire will do.\nSTEP 4: repeat the procedure with remaining pieces.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8J/WXUK/ISYN1EG6/F8JWXUKISYN1EG6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEV/Q73Z/ISYN1EIO/FEVQ73ZISYN1EIO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZW/BAU5/ISYN1EH2/FZWBAU5ISYN1EH2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKT/T9ZT/ISYN1EJM/FKTT9ZTISYN1EJM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYV/AZXU/ISYN1EKM/FYVAZXUISYN1EKM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMC/TF3A/ISYN1EL5/FMCTF3AISYN1EL5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5S/EZ2B/ISYN1ELQ/F5SEZ2BISYN1ELQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 17: PART 2 : the Trees"}, {"step": 18, "steps_text": "Now that you\u2019ve made all 5 (or more) pieces, take the wooden piece of rod (acctually it can be anything that has the rigidity to support our tree; metal rod, used pen, a pencil, you get the idea.) and tape it with masking tape, or duct tape (masking tape is cheaper and the papaer mache will stick to it better). Try to press the layers of the tape hard so you won\u2019t get a soft base for later steps. Depending on what you want to make (in my case - a Baobab tree), make sure you tape enough layers around your piece of rod. You don\u2019t have to do this step, but it saves time which is the only thing that you really abuse in this project. Up to this point, this project has taken me 6 days. Next thing you want to do is to wrap five pieces of wire onto the top of the rod so they are firmly in place. Those pieces will the base for the branches. Just arrange them to be more or less evenly apart. Next: spread hose wires apart to make them in a star shape, and fold them in two to get more surface on which to apply paper mache.You can use the drill again in the same manner as before. When branches are done, form them in shape you wish and apply masking tape to them to make paper mache-ing easier. Make sure that the masking tape is firmly applied. Do this with all branches.

It's a set of shapes that fit together in many interesting ways and form a full cube of 64 blocks when packed together correctly. What caught my eye was the diversity of shapes it could be assembled into, but the downside was the cost: paying $100-$300 for some blocks isn't really my thing, even if solving puzzles is.\nWhat's great about this project is that the little cubes are just square cutouts on thick plywood, so they can be made even from the smallest of scraps. For mine I used 1/4\" thick plywood so I cut out 1/4\" x 1/4\" squares, thus making cubes with 1/4\" sides (roughly; kerf wasn't too big of a deal). That made dark and light faces (light from the wood, dark from cut edges) that I could rotate and make interesting patterns while gluing the pieces together.", "title": "Wooden Naef Cubicus Puzzle", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Wooden-Naef-Cubicus-Puzzle/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "laser cutter (If you don't already have access to one, check out local makerspaces near you, or even online options.

Since I used 1/4\" thick plywood, I cut out 1/4\" x 1/4\" squares, thus making cubes with 1/4\" sides. For 1/8\" thick plywood, you'd cut out 1/8\" x 1/8\", and so on.\nFor making the file (Illustrator file attached to this step), I tried two different ways. I tried a linear array of squares spaced out evenly and a grid of squares interfacing with each other (i.e. square grid). These two ways were to test a) the possibility of a fire happening from laser cutting a grid of such small squares and b) the charring of the edges from laser cutting the grid. The grid is advantageous in that it's faster to cut and saves more plywood, but those two effects might be problematic.\nHowever, when I finally went to cut it, both methods (grid and spaced out array) worked just about comparably. The grid did have a bit more charring, but only if you looked really closely -- in my eyes, it made little difference.\nIn any case: cut out 64 squares, either by having a spaced out linear array or by cutting a square grid (9 lines by 9 lines).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1F/HPC7/IST3NQWJ/F1FHPC7IST3NQWJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4D/VOA7/IST3NQX4/F4DVOA7IST3NQX4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI2/K97Z/IST3NQXQ/FI2K97ZIST3NQXQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Laser Cutting"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Now that you have cubes, let's begin assembly!\nQuick note on checkerboard patterning: the laser cut cubes have two light faces (from the wood) and four dark faces (from the cuts).

Altogether, by rotating your cubes as you assemble the puzzle pieces, you can get interesting designs.\nBegin by gluing four cubes in a line. It's VERY important throughout the assembly process that your cubes are as straight and parallel/perpendicular to each other as possible -- no crookedness! Rotate the cubes however you'd like. In my case, instead of lining up light faces with light faces or anything, I just glued them semi-randomly -- see the first and second pictures to see what I mean. I really liked how the random effect showed up in the final puzzle.\nAdd another 3 cubes at a 90 degree angle from the end of the first four cubes. Again, rotate the cubes and create whatever pattern you'd like. After those three, add another 3 cubes that are perpendicular to the plane that the first seven cubes occupy -- see the fourth image above for what I mean.\nI wanted there to be a little method to the madness of my cube rotations so I made the two sides of my puzzle pieces symmetric.

As you can see in the pictures, we used a square against the top of the headstock to make sure the tuners were perpendicular to the top edge. For the neck joint pilot holes, we put the neck into the body, and used the holes through the back of the cavity to mark the back of the neck. When doing so, just make sure you get the neck to sit in the pocket all the way towards the bridge, and all the way down flush against the flat bottom. For marking the hole for the string tree, we just measured the placement of the original, and tried to duplicate that on the new neck. This is generally not a good thing to do, but this is not structural, and thus doesn't have to be as precise as the other holes.\nWhen drilling, make sure you set a maximum depth on the drill press based on how long your screws are. For your drill bit size, you'll want to use a bit that is the same size as the shaft of your screw, and not one that reaches to the extent of the threads. If you're unsure, it is best to start a little small. You can't add wood back!

When doing so, you'll want to use a softwood scrap against the neck to keep it clean, and un-dented.

We cranked the truss rod roughly a turn and a half. However, it would be wise not to crank it too much initially. As the neck gets used to all that tension from the strings, it may bow out. If you tighten the rod too much, it may back-bow, and you don't want the wood to get used to that.\nIf you really want the bass to feel and sound the best, it is always wise to take it to a professional instrument repairman to get the intonation set up right.

So did children who were older than me. I didn't know who invented it, a genius maybe. Nor do I know if same or similar games were/are played by children/people in other parts of the world.\nThis set of exercise can be played by one person alone or a group of any number of players.\nThe central feature is to use a part of your body to kick/push the ball straight up in air, receive the ball when it falls and kick/push up for a predetermined times. When the ball falls off to ground, the turn of that player is over, it's next player's turn. We usually started with \"kicking 5\", then \"kicking 10\", on and on.\nThe game starts first using the inside of the feet with leg bends in front of you at knee for about 30-45 degrees angle; second, outside of the feet with leg bends to the side about 30-45 degrees angle; third, toes with leg straight; forth, leg below knee part with leg straight; fifth, leg above knee part with leg below knee part perpendicular to it; sixth, top of elbow with arm folded in front; seventh, with a jump, use the hind of the heel of the other foot, cross from behind to kick/push the ball straight up to the air, receive the ball with the same body part and repeat the action for 5 times if the player is in \"kicking 5\" stage. The last exercise is the hardest. Seldom can a player do 5 in a row without the ball falling to the ground instead of the hind heel of the other foot. You can see in the video I can only do one now, occasionally two.\nThe video in the introduction shows the first and second exercise. I was \"kicking 10\" and the ball fell out of my control after 3 into the second exercise. The video in this step shows the seventh exercise. Some of the actions of the set are often seen in soccer games. Maybe I'm biased. Looking back, the set of exercises seem like developed by sports experts for children. They not only uses every body parts, they require a lot mental ability for balancing. as the number of players increases, it also requires good elementary math for counting, addition, and memory to remember who is doing how many of what.\nThere is no losers in the game.

If you like this instructable, please vote for it in the Instructables Puzzle Competition, thanks!\nI designed this puzzle a few months ago in Solidworks. While it was my own independent idea and design, I later learned that this puzzle has been made before, under the name of the \"Rhombiminx\", so I'll give a little bit of history about it before I go into how to make one.\nFrom the TwistyPuzzles Museum:\n\"The Rhombiminx was originally built in 2003 by Laurent Blanc from a modified giant Rubik's 2x2x2. In 2008, it was independently designed and built by Garrett Ong using a modified Eastsheen 4x4x4 mechanism and cast tips parts made from handbuilt masters. Later on a second version was built using FDM printed master parts for a more precise build. In April 2009 a mini version was built using a mini Eastsheen 2x2x2 core and molding/casting. From the solving point of view the puzzles behaves like a 4x4x4 which contains just face cubies. The version from 2008 sold for 205 USD.\"\nAs far as I know, this is the first Rhombiminx that (besides the mini 2x2 core) has been completely FDM 3D-Printed.

The time is nigh! It's time to finish it off!! Start off by making a back brace. Now somehow my image of this got corrupted :( Oh well, It is fairly straightforward I just had a 1/2\" by 1/2\" piece of square dowel/scrap. As for the length you play with it a bit, it goes from the top of the body (the upper bout) to the bottom riding flush with the back. Put a little glue on the top of it, and on the bottom and slide it into place and leave it to dry, that'll do it!\nNext glue the back on, it's far easier this time as the sides are in place. So just put a bead of glue down in the notch and hold the back down with some masking tape. If you need to add another notch for the brace you can do that, always dry fit!\nWhat I did next was apply some semi-gloss spray polyurethane, I did like 4 coats, letting it dry in between.\nNow the tuner holes, here is a tip, make sure you have room for the them all to turn. I eyeballed it and failed! oh well fixed now. Mark the holes and drill them out real slow like. Drill bit size; follow the specs of the tuners you get.\nNext glue on your bridge and nut, my bridge is just a 2\" piece of square dowel with a slant. The scale length of a soprano uke is 13\" so have the string contact point 13\" from your nut. As for the nut, I just put four shallow notches in a nail that I cut to width and sanded the point off of then crazy glued it in place, easy stuff!\nFinally the tailpiece I just took some the angle iron and cut it to the same width as the bridge then brought it to a point on the butt end. Next drill 5 holes, 4 1/32\" for the strings and then 1 at the point at 1/8\". Make sure you take off the sharp edges with a small file or sandpaper on the inside of the string holes so they don't cut the strings. Now just align the tailpiece with the neck and screw it into the brace through the 1/8\" hole, you may want to drill a pilot how so you don't split the brace. Lastly bend the tailpiece up a bit from the front, so you can get the strings in there.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FT7/F2MU/ISCB9LBE/FT7F2MUISCB9LBE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHB/0M0Z/ISCB9LAD/FHB0M0ZISCB9LAD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCO/FWUT/ISCB9LCH/FCOFWUTISCB9LCH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY5/AAEE/ISCB9LAB/FY5AAEEISCB9LAB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYV/104B/ISCB9LGL/FYV104BISCB9LGL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Finishing!"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Hey you!

To avoid that risk I just roll the cream quickly on my tongue. If you roll it fast enough, it doesn't even feel cold at all.\nAssuming that my mouth is approximately 98.6F and liquid nitrogen is -321F, there is a difference of nearly 420F.

As you cut this, think about what size is both protective (obvious) but still allows movement. One instinct in beginning design is to create a large shield, as if the point of a water gun fight is to stay dry (why play?). No, your kid will want to maneuver. If their shield is wide it will be cumbersome. If it is too long, they will be tripping over it. You can buy new polycarbonate at Home Depot for about $15. They also sell translucent colored sheets, if you want to create distinct armies (red vs. green!)\nYou are cutting so the ribs are vertical to provide stregnth, but it will also curve around the child when they tense their wrist. Later, feel free to experiment with shapes (a single panel offers up a lot of shields) but the material and history shows the rectangle is pretty efficient. We found that, after cut, the edges were not sharp.\nThe panel was already 24\" wide, but I cut it down to 18\" for a kid's body.

The stuff I used was wide and the rubber coating is comfortable and did not chafe when wet, unlike rope (they probably won't play long enough for it to matter). You do want wide wire--some lamp cord would do, too--so it does not cut. I cut two 12\" lengths of wire.\nTwo straps will do the trick. One will be where the hand is, so the child can grab it. The second will be near the elbow. Combined, they should allow the child to control the shield like Captain America does his.

Then, feed the audio wire through so the knot(s) will be on the front (knots on the arm will rub, so the front is best). The loops need to be big enough for easy in-out of the arm, but tight enough so the shield feels like an extension of the arm (feel free to watch Captain America: The First Avenger with the kids to get the idea). Audio wire can be difficult to knot, but a small wrapping of electrical tape can create a big enough ball to keep it from coming back through the hole.\nTa dah, you have a shield.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FU5/722X/ISCATFCE/FU5722XISCATFCE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQJ/2EXD/ISCATF98/FQJ2EXDISCATF98.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVF/0IXF/ISCATFJW/FVF0IXFISCATFJW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE1/3YF7/ISCATFU2/FE13YF7ISCATFU2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8P/4YQQ/ISCATFQW/F8P4YQQISCATFQW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUP/KUQQ/ISCATET4/FUPKUQQISCATET4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F27/U5DF/ISCATEQM/F27U5DFISCATEQM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Attach Straps"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "When I was a kid I wanted a tree fort. My father build me a nice platform. Simple and clean.\nBut that wasn't enough for me. I tacked up walls made of scraps, an ugly mess of random boards and rusty nails. It looked horrible and I knew it and kept \"improving\" it until I grew old enough to appreciate the simplicity he offered me at first.\nLet that be a lesson: Sometimes simple is best.\nDecorations: That said, a nice rainy day activity is for the child to decorate their shield. You'll need Sharpies if you want them to be permanent (Crayola will last about five minutes in battle, but then they can redecorate for added fun). You can use the Crayolas to design the decorations (no regrets) and drawn over with the Sharpie. More colors offer more choices.\nIf you want, you can create a crest. Have them put those things that are important to them--who they are. It will give them direction, but it can also be corny.\nVideo and Strategy: You can also find some nice videos on tactics and shields. The Roman turtle tactic, for example, is interesting, and a gang of neighboring kids can try it out. In the heat of battle, local children tend not to be as disciplined as centurions, but their imagining it working is fun. Again, Captain America: The First Avenger is a fine movie with some good shield action (these shields do not throw well, though). 300 would be less appropriate.\nPlanning the Attack: Another rainy day activity is drawing up a battle plan. A simple sketch of the battlefield can be copied twenty times, allowing young generals scratch paper to draw up plans. Your little Ender Wiggum needs to learn to plan before battle, and not learn on the blunt end of a stick over and over.

We had thought \"Wouldn't it be great if, instead of four small Kitt Katt bars they had one giant bar?\" Now we have it. We thought, \"Wouldn't it be cool if this Tonka truck made its own sounds and had lights and moved on its own?\" Now we have it. Ten years ago, I struggled to find a box of mixed Legos for my son--kits was all they had (thankfully, that's fixed). In making things better, though, we killed a lot of what was fun--imagination, anticipation, dreams.... I just enjoy those small Kitt Katts better because I cannot get enough.\nCue the old man music.\nThe supersoaker is an example of this. I grew up with those stupid plastic squirt guns that had the plug in the back that required you to plunge it under water and wait while little bubbles showed out water was (slowly) displacing air. Once full, the range and aim was lame, and it jammed and ran out of water too quickly. The supersoaker was the opposite end of the spectrum--the tanks filled with wide mouths and the range was insane. But, playing with one was an activity that lasted ten minutes--everyone would get soaked, laugh, and then not know what to do next. The neighbor was always a kid that either cried about it or would not stop when everyone else had moved on to another activity.\nNothing beats extended battle, with strategy and lot of running to wear out the kids both mentally and physically.\n1. Buy Cheap, Classic Single Shot Water Guns. Lots of them, and variety. Drug and/or toy stores sells sleeves of them for nothing. Variety is key, as children think the style or color of the gun matters. It does not. But if you have five or so for each kid they can experiment. Also, when they begin to fail (they will; they're cheap) they have back-ups.\n2. Water Depots in a Neutral Zone. I fill a couple of buckets with water (Home Depot Homer buckets are great) and put them on the patio. The patio is the safe, no fire zone. They can take all of their guns and fill them without worry. The zone also makes a destination, allowing for ambushes and fun tension as their \"ammo\" reaches critical.\n3. Obstacle filled Battlefield. A yard. Our house offers corners and obstructions as they circle it looking for each other. We have a soccer goal, a play house, a picnic table, a few trees.... You get the idea.\n4. Accessories. Water balloons are fun, but can be a pain to fill--and time consuming. Take them out for treats, only. Far easier are cups--give each child a hard plastic cup to fill with water and dump on someone. The shield from this instructable adds the illusion of protection, but in the heat of battle they will get wet over time. Whatever you add, make sure it adds depth to the battle, not volume of water. Once you have a superweapon the game is done; you might as well bring out the hose.\nIn the end, that's the point--keep it simple. By keeping kids on the edge of domination they will keep grasping for it. With these elements, the guns will require time and effort and die just before success. The shield will protect, but not over time. Just as it gets boring, a successful cup of water over the head of an unsuspecting big brother will rule memories of the day.

I used duct tape to hold the PVC in place and seal off the openings while the Epoxy was poured.\nSupposing your blower does not have this same sort of detachable bagger fitting you may have to devise an alternate method to seal a PVC fitting into the opening.

Next, as you move around it, the Rubik's Cube rotates in mid air, always following you - left, right, up, down - no matter which direction you move, the cube moves with you - watch the video to see what I mean. Finally, when your friends manage to discover how your possessed Rubik's Cube works, it will really blow their minds! The video at the end of this Instructable exposes how the illusion works.\nI got the idea for this piece of visual deception from various items I've been familiar with for quite a while. If you do a search on \"Hollow Face Illusion\", \"Hollow Mask Illusion\" or \"Gathering for Gardner Dragon\" you'll see some of the inspirations for my Rubik's Cube. The success of these illusions is dependent on how our brains process the information sent by our eyes - the brain relies on familiar references to tell us what we're seeing, so we can be deceived when something looks like a familiar object but actually isn't. It occurred to me that a Rubik's Cube is a very familiar object that ought to be able to trigger the same response, so I tried constructing a Rubik's Cube version of the illusion and discovered that it works beautifully. I did a pretty thorough search and - to my knowledge - this is a first; I've not encountered anyone else who has applied this illusion to a Rubik's Cube. It's hard for me to believe that someone else hasn't already done this, but if they have I was not able to find any reference to it. If someone else out there has, please accept my apologies, but I believe as I write this that it's a brand new application of the Hollow Mask Illusion.\nFirst, I'd like to offer a little explanation of the Hollow Mask Illusion and how it applies to my Rubik's Cube Illusion. The Hollow Mask Illusion works because we are familiar with what a human face should look like. When we encounter the inside of a mask of the human face - if certain visual cues and lighting are right - our brains tend to interpret what we're seeing as the outside of the mask rather than the inside, as we are not accustomed to seeing a face as if we were looking at it from the inside. Then, when we move - or the mask moves - so that our perspective changes, the face appears to be following us. As long as our (or the mask's) range of motion is constrained to an area where no edge line of the mask interferes with the illusion it will persist - and can be quite unnerving! The moment we move outside these constraints the illusion breaks down, our brains get busy recalibrating the information we're receiving and we experience a flash of confusion until our brains can figure it all out.\nThe same applies to my Rubik's Cube. An observer will believe they are looking at three of the outer faces of a normal Rubik's Cube because that's what they are familiar with seeing. What they are actually looking at, however, is three faces of a Rubik's Cube as if they were inside the cube looking out - instead of the point where the three faces meet being nearest them, it is the point farthest from them. Then, when they move to the left, for instance, the brain expects the point where the faces join to move to the right, because that's normally what happens. However, since the entire object is inverted, the point where the faces join appears to move to the left - the same direction the viewer is moving - creating the illusion that the cube is rotating in mid air to follow the viewer's movement.\nTwo factors can either enhance or detract from the illusion - lighting and perspective. Since the object is actually inverted, normal lighting can cast shadows that will throw dissonance into the illusion. For that reason it is best to either have lighting coming from a bit below the object (because it normally comes from above) or strong enough to wash out most shadowing. This is not a big problem in the Rubik's Cube version as there are only three flat faces so there is little in the way of shadow. Soft light shining directly into the cube without casting too dark of a shadow behind it will work best.\nThe second factor is perspective, and this turned out to be the tough nut to crack. Perspective is how our brain perceives distances. It knows that the farther away from us a regularly shaped object is, the smaller it will appear to be. And since a Rubik's Cube is very regular in shape, there should be a strong sense that the outer edges of the Rubik's Cube get smaller as they recede from us. But if you were to make this cube of three square faces you'd discover that because the edges are inverted, the ones that should be appearing to get smaller because they are farther away actually are getting larger because they are actually closer. This can really mess with our brains - as well as the illusion.\nI lost count of how many iterations I went through trying to solve the perspective problem. I suppose if I owned some decent CAD software it might have made it much easier...but I don't. Calculations I thought would work didn't and it all wound up boiling down to trial and error. The pictures I've provided are the end result of way too many long nights creating prototypes, discovering that they didn't satisfactorily solve the perspective problem, tossing them out and starting all over from scratch. But the good news is that the final result works quite well...and I'll never have to go through that exercise in frustration again!\nI'm going to describe three methods of making your own cube - the Quick and Dirty Version, the Lucky Scavenger Version, and the From Scratch Version. Each will be pretty much it's own process, so each \"step\" of my Instructable is actually one of the three versions of my possessed cube. The actual construction steps are broken down within each version.", "title": "Make a Possessed Rubik's Cube", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-Possessed-Rubiks-Cube/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "You can make this version in only a few minutes just to see the effect and decide if you want to make a more substantial version, This cube will not hold up for very long, as even a thicker paper will begin to curl after a short while and that will mess up the illusion.\nTo make this version, simply:\nA. Print out the Rubik's Cube faces in Figure 1. Size the image so that the edges that join at 90 degrees are about three inches long. If you have thicker paper and your printer will accept it, use that. You'll notice that I used yellow paper - that's because I didn't have any white card stock laying around, but I did have yellow.\nB. Cut carefully along the outer edges of the faces and the tab. Make a clean, sharp fold (a ruler held firmly down along the fold line will help) down the center of the black areas between each face so that you are folding the colored faces toward each other as in Figure 2. Fold the tab along the third face in the same fashion.\nC. Fold the red and yellow sides up so they are at 90 degrees to the blue face. Fold the tab behind the yellow face and tape or glue it in place (Figure 3).\nD. Print out the image for the cube arm (Figure 4) and cut it out and fold it along each line as in Figure 5. Now fold it together to make a triangular tube. The fourth section is used as a tab which should overlap and be glued or taped to the first section. Slit each of the three edges down to the mark and fold the three resulting tabs away from the tube. Attach the tabs on one end to the center back of the cube (Figure 6). The tabs on the other end can be spread out and taped or glued to the surface on which you want to mount your cube. That's it!\nNOTE: The arm can be made as short or as long as you like depending on where and how you want to display your cube. The longer the arm, the more the cube will appear to be floating in mid air. But a longer arm reduces the range of motion the viewer has before revealing the presence of the arm. The shorter the arm, the greater the viewer's range of motion - but the weaker the mid air illusion will be.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWO/JUGL/IRXTLNJK/FWOJUGLIRXTLNJK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX7/3DS4/IRXTLNJL/FX73DS4IRXTLNJL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG9/VRKW/IRXTLNJM/FG9VRKWIRXTLNJM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1H/AXHX/IRXTLNJN/F1HAXHXIRXTLNJN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRY/FA6L/IRXTLNJO/FRYFA6LIRXTLNJO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP7/8IQC/IRXTLNJP/FP78IQCIRXTLNJP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: The Quick and Dirty Version"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "IF you are lucky enough to happen upon a plastic container of some sort with a roughly 3\" square base you can save yourself a lot of detail work. I was hoping to make mine this way, but after tearing the house apart and rummaging through several dollar stores I was unable to find an appropriate container. I didn't think it would be difficult, but it was.\nIf you do happen to be lucky enough, here's how to proceed:\nA. Cut the height of the container down to the same size as the base (Figure 7). Then cut two adjacent sides off the resulting piece and you have your basic semi-cube form for the illusion (Figure 8).\nB. Size and print Figure 9 so that the faces (including the black edges) are a bit smaller than the inner faces of your cube base.\nC. Cut out each face, spray the backs with adhesive (Figure 10) and carefully apply the faces to the inside faces of the semi-cube.\nD. Once the faces have been applied it will become apparent that the outer edges are not 90 degrees and you'll have to cut or sand the edges of your semi-cube down so that they'll be flush with the images you glued to them. Use whatever method you used to cut the container to make the cuts. I have a mini table saw I used (lower the blade height to just high enough to cut the plastic - this will keep the plastic from cracking as you cut), but there are a variety of ways to cut plastic - the important part is that you want the edges to be straight and clean.\nE. Use a black Sharpie or a small paintbrush and flat black paint to run along the outer edges of each face to cover the thickness of the paper and the underlying plastic. You can also run the Sharpie or brush along the inner angles to help them disappear (Figure 11).\nF. Use leftovers from the original container or some other available strips of rigid plastic to make the arm for the back of the piece. I used epoxy to glue three pieces together for the arm as in Figure 12. Glue the arm to the back of the semi-cube as in Figure 13 and you're done.\nNOTES: A black or transparent container will work best. If you want a really convincing product, don't settle for \"good enough\" - the surfaces must be truly flat and the inside corners must be truly square for the illusion to work well - rounded inner corners just will not do. The outer edges must blend into the black of the faces, so if your piece is transparent, you really need to paint the edges flat black (best choice) or go over them with a black Sharpie so they will not be noticeable.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQD/K3U8/IRXTQDVD/FQDK3U8IRXTQDVD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCW/V6OP/IRXTLNJR/FCWV6OPIRXTLNJR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F60/X9BJ/IRXTLNJS/F60X9BJIRXTLNJS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD1/ILRW/IRXTLNJV/FD1ILRWIRXTLNJV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0V/64KY/IRXTLNJW/F0V64KYIRXTLNJW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAQ/6I5Y/IRXTLNJX/FAQ6I5YIRXTLNJX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBN/JMHF/IRXTLNJY/FBNJMHFIRXTLNJY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Lucky Scavenger Version"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I couldn't find an appropriate container so I had to go this route. Fortunately, I had a whole pile of extra plastic CD cases made of very thin and rigid transparent plastic (Figure 14).\nA. I cut three 3 1/2\" squares out of the CD cases. Using the table of my miter saw for a precise 90 degrees, I used epoxy glue to glue two of the squares together at 90 degrees. - I put a layer of wax paper between the squares and the table so I wouldn't glue the squares to my miter table. Once that joint was dry, I epoxied the third square to the first two in the same fashion (Figure 15). I made my semi-cube 3 1/2 inches, planning to cut it down to the exact size once I had applied the Rubik's Cube faces.\nB. Return to part B in the Lucky Scavenger Version (Step 2) and proceed from there.\nThoughts on displaying your Possessed Cube: The paper cube is easy - fold the tabs on the far end of the arm outward and tape them to whatever surface you want. Use your imagination for the plastic version. If I had made the arm for my cube in the video just a tiny bit wider it would have slipped right over the on/off knob on my pole lamp. But I had to find a short cylinder that would fit inside the arm and use a rubber band to attach the cylinder to the knob. A peg that fits inside the arm works fine - that's what I used for the cube in the picture frame - just painted a piece of plywood, drilled a hole in the center to hold the peg and mounted the plywood inside the frame. Then I just slipped the arm over the peg. You could also drill a small hole in one face of the arm near the end and hang it on a wall with a hook or angled nail. Like I said, use your imagination!\nFor maximum effect, the cube should be placed somewhere that will limit the viewer's ability to move around it and discover how it's done. An excellent place would be to hang the cube on a wall at the end of a narrow hallway. You could put a frame around it as I did for one picture and the cube will float out of the frame. Or you could hang it inside an empty cabinet so that when someone opens the cabinet door, there the cube is, floating in front of them and moving wherever they move - freaky! Another idea would be to make a miniature version of the cube - say, about 1 inch on each face. Use a thin stick for the arm, hold the stick between the middle two fingers of your hand, and show it to the viewer, palm held flat and fingers together. As you move the palm of your hand around a bit, it will make the cube appear to dance in mid air over the palm of your hand. The video in this step shows how the illusion suddenly collapses when the viewing position goes beyond having all three faces in view.\nAnd finally, if you want to really pop the effect once you've made your own Possessed Rubik's Cube, close one eye and move around it - you'll find it nearly impossible to shake the illusion! This is because it is our binocular vision that allows our brain to see perspective and judge distance. Since perspective is the biggest hurdle to overcome in this illusion, depriving our brain of the ability to establish perspective by closing one eye makes it that much easier to deceive our senses.\nThanks for taking the time to view my Instructable.

While the modern generation of gaming consoles and high-end PC's provide a graphically rich experience, there is a charm about the older games that you don't tend to get these days. Maybe it's just nostalgia, but they offer something that is often forgotten in the current generation.. games built purely around gameplay! Some of the older games can be so much fun and so immersive to play, the visuals become secondary to the whole experience.\nWanting to find out if my fond memories of classic games were nothing more than rose tinted nostalgia or if they really were that awesome, I decided to build a Retro gaming console and revisit the past. I wasn't stopping there though, this is not only a Retro gaming system but also a Media player. To keep things as cheap, simple and as light-weight as possible I opted to build it with Raspberry Pi using RetroPie, Emulation Station and Kodi.\nThe whole thing is enclosed in one of the most iconic games consoles of all time, Nintendo's Entertainment System (NES). To put a little extra polish and shine on the overall look I decided to paint the enclosure in the colour scheme of the Marvel Comic Hero Iron Man, this lead to the system being dubbed the ARCade Reactor(did you see what I did there?). As an added bonus the system also supports the use of original NES controllers, this adds a real sense of authenticity to the whole retro gaming thing.\nThe ARCade Reactor Gaming and Media System has the following specification and features:\nRetroPie Multi-Platform gaming with support for over 20 systems\nKodi (XBMC) Home Theater\nModded NES enclosure for that retro look\nMarvel Iron Man themed paint scheme\nRaspberry Pi 3 model B (1.2Ghz x64 Quad-core ARM CPU, 1 Gb RAM)\nPi's SDHC card slot extended to the main case exterior\nUSB-2.0, Bluetooth, Ethernet, Wi-Fi and HDMI Connectivity\n1 TB USB-2.0 Hard Disk Storage Drive\nDVD Optical Drive (slot-loading)\nWireless (PS3 DualShock) Controller\nSupport for original NES Controller\nHeat-Sinks and Cooling Fan to enable overclocking\nThe Project is broken down into 10 steps (note that steps 3, 6 and 10 contain optional tasks):\nThings You Will Need\nPreparing the Console Enclosure / Case\nPainting the Case (Optional)\nInstalling and Configuring RetroPie\nConfiguring Gamepad, Wi-Fi and Adding ROMS (Games)\nInstalling Kodi, USB HDD, DVD and Wireless Controllers (Optional)\nElectronics and Wiring\nAssembly (Part 1)\nAssembly (Part 2)\nTweaks and Customisation (Optional)", "title": "ARCade Reactor - RetroPie Gaming and Media System", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/ARCade-Reactor-RetroPie-Gaming-and-Media-System/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The things you'll need to re-create this project are divided into three main categories: Tools, Hardware and Software.

I have one that's faulty and also has some discolouration on the case so it's perfect for this project, while NES' are far from rare, I would be reluctant to sacrifice one that's in good condition. Plus it will only upset the purists.\nThe enclosure itself is sturdy, spacious and pretty easy to take apart. If you need guidance to help strip it down I've included a video, you're basically looking to get it down to the bare shell. Be sure to safely store all the screws and fixings that you remove as they will all get used again later when we put it back together with the new bits inside.\nTo enable us to add modern connectivity to the NES (such as HDMI, USB etc.) we need to 3d print some new connector panels. The STL files for these are provided and the method for fixing them to the enclosure is outlined below. If you are not painting your enclosure try to colour match your 3d printed parts to the enclosure.\nHow to prepare the console enclosure:\nStrip down the enclosure, removing all of the internal components and retaining the screws and the power/reset button assembly for later.\nDe-solder the blue header connector for the from the NES' mainboard (we'll also use this later)\nUsing the new 3d printed panels, outline them using a marker pen as indicated by the photos\nCut out the new rear panels using the rotary tool and the cutting bit\nTrim the cartridge supports from the top cover as indicated by the photo, again using the rotary tool\nDry fit the new 3d printed panels to test the fit, adjust by filing the case if necessary\nGlue the new panels in place with Superglue, then use hot-melt glue to further secure them\nLet the glue set and harden/cool before moving to the next step\nDon't worry if you cut your panel openings larger than necessary as we can always fill them with body filler later, but avoid making them too big as it won't be as secure when the new panels are glued in place.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQP/SXCW/IQYT27S3/FQPSXCWIQYT27S3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6X/OM0J/IQYT27S4/F6XOM0JIQYT27S4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF9/EWU4/IQYT27S6/FF9EWU4IQYT27S6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1C/TMRL/IQYT27QI/F1CTMRLIQYT27QI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYF/YI4Y/IQYT165R/FYFYI4YIQYT165R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS3/WDYR/IQYT27QF/FS3WDYRIQYT27QF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6B/0ROY/IQYT15PK/F6B0ROYIQYT15PK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F77/UW7U/IQYT27QV/F77UW7UIQYT27QV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSA/8XDY/IQYT27QY/FSA8XDYIQYT27QY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVC/74F7/IQYT27QW/FVC74F7IQYT27QW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7G/FV41/IQYT27QZ/F7GFV41IQYT27QZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Preparing the Console Enclosure / Case"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "This step is optional and depends entirely on your personal preference. As my NES' case was in relatively poor condition (it had signs of discolouration caused by exposure to sunlight) I decided that I would paint it. I opted for an Iron Man theme so red and gold were the chosen colours. The painting process can be time consuming and a lot of effort is put into prepping, sanding, cleaning then waiting for things to dry etc. It's very much a task that requires patience, the more time and effort you put into the process now the better the end result will be, so don't be tempted to rush it.\nTip: While you're waiting for the paint to dry, why not move to the next step and make a start on installing RetroPie.\nTo complete the painting process you will need the items listed below, these are usually available from any good hardware store but you'll often find a better range and better value from a car parts store. I'm using rattle-can/spray paints, for best results use the ones designed for automotive use. Compressed-air powered automotive paints will yield much better results if you have access to the equipment, but a decent finish can be achieved using rattle-cans if you follow the right process and take care.\nYou will need\nCar body filler and applicator tool\nVarying grit levels of wet and dry sandpaper (I used 800, 1200 and 1500 grit paper)\nSanding pad/block\nPowder free disposable gloves\nGood quality masking tape\nClean lint-free cloths\nTack cloths\nPaper towels for drying\nBucket of water\nAcrylic based automotive paint (I used Metallic Gold and Radiant Red)\nPaint primer (I used a red primer and a white primer for the gold)\nClear Lacquer (for top-coat)\nPPE (Gloves, goggles, air filter/breathing apparatus - paint fumes are dangerous, always take precautions!)\nPatience! (The painting can take up to a week to finish)\nStage 1: Prepping for Painting\nWith painting, preparation is everything. To begin with we need to clean the case and remove any dirt, grease and oil etc. Use warm soapy water and a lint-free cloth, then rinse in clean fresh water and dry thoroughly! Next, lightly sand the case with the coarsest of the sand papers, this will roughen up the surface to give the prime coat a good surface to adhere to. Once sanded, repeat the cleaning process and finish by rubbing down with a tack cloth. I'd recommend using disposable gloves at this stage to prevent the natural oils on your hands getting onto the clean surface. Cover any openings, vents, panel cut-aways and screw holes with masking tape.\nStage 2: The Prime Coat\nThis prime coat is done in 12 main steps:\nApply the first coat of primer\nWait 15 minutes\nApply the second coat of primer\nLeave to dry for at least 24 hours\nLightly sand with 1200 grit paper\nClean with a damp cloth, thoroughly dry then wipe with a tack cloth\nRepeat the above for coats three and four\nStage 3: The Colour Coat\nJust like the prime coat, the colour coat is done 12 steps, the final step is optional:\nApply the first coat of colour\nWait 15 minutes\nApply the second coat of colour\nLeave to dry for at least 24 hours\nLightly sand with 1200 grit paper, you can do this wet or dry but I like to wet sand it\nClean with a damp cloth, thoroughly dry then wipe with a tack cloth\nRepeat the above for coats three and four, but switch to the finest of the sand papers\nAt this stage you can consider using a rubbing compound to improve the finish. Though this is entirely optional, I would recommend it. For best results follow the instructions provided by the product.\nStage 4: The Clear Lacquer (Top Coat)\nThe lacquer process is done in 10 steps:\nApply the first coat of clear lacquer\nWait 15 minutes\nApply the second coat of lacquer\nLeave to dry for at least 24 hours\nLightly sand with the finest sand paper\nClean with a damp cloth, thoroughly dry then wipe with a tack cloth\nRepeat steps 1-4, you should only need to finish with a final sanding if it feels rough to the touch\nAdditional Painting\nAs well as painting the NES enclosure itself, the NES controller ports can also be painted. Avoid getting paint on the contacts and mask these areas well. I'd suggest only applying a couple of coats of the paint colour then finishing up with a single coat of lacquer. I also painted my PS3 controller using the paint method outlined above.\nTips\nAlways follow the guidelines and instructions provided with the paint\nShake can well for at least 2 minutes before painting\nMany thin coats are better than thick coats\nIf the paint runs you are either spraying too close or applying too much in a given area\nShake the can periodically during painting\nAvoid touching the paint when wet\nTake the necessary precautions when using solvents, paint can be harmful. Always read the label\nGet on YouTube and check out some spray painting tips, I like this tutorial by Dave Blake", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRW/0WHV/IQYT27R8/FRW0WHVIQYT27R8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDZ/U9EJ/IQYT27R3/FDZU9EJIQYT27R3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F12/NRL2/IQYT16WK/F12NRL2IQYT16WK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB1/3DBJ/IQYT16WR/FB13DBJIQYT16WR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQG/YRHF/IQYT16WS/FQGYRHFIQYT16WS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGJ/DHZO/IQYT27R9/FGJDHZOIQYT27R9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3Q/MB36/IQYT27RA/F3QMB36IQYT27RA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Painting the Case (Optional)"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Tip: I'd recommend you install and configure RetroPie before you assemble it into the complete case so you can make sure everything works first.\nNote: The Raspberry Pi 3 has a higher power demand than previous models. Powering via a USB hub or using a power supply intended for the Pi 2 or older probably won't be up the job, a current capacity of 2.5A is recommended.\nStage 1: Preparing the SD Card / Image\nBefore we begin you'll need to download and extract the latest version of the RetroPie SD-Card Image (at the time of writing this was v3.8.1). The image is available to download from RetroPie, be sure to download the correct one for your model Pi (I'm using the image for Raspberry Pi 2/3). If you have any trouble extracting the compressed file download and install WinRAR\nOnce you have your image file you need to write it to your SD card, if you've used a Raspberry Pi before you should already be familiar with this process, if not you can follow the official Raspberry Pi guide for your environment here: Windows, MacOS, Linux\nStage 2: Boot from the SD Card\nNow you've got your SD card prepared with the RetroPie image you'll want to insert the SD card into your Pi and power it on. It should display the RetroPie splashscreen, then after a short delay it will automatically resize the SD cards file system before rebooting again, this time loading Emulation Station. Assuming you don't have one connected yet you should see a dialog box on screen that says \"No Gamepads Detected\". Make sure you have a keyboard connected then press F4 to quit, this will exit you to the command line / terminal.\nStage 3: Configure Raspbian\nAt the command line / terminal type sudo raspi-config to launch the Raspberry Pi Configuration Tool.\nNote:Though not essential, it is a good idea idea to set your locale and region settings correctly.\nUsing the keyboard navigate down to 5 Internationalisation Options and press Enter\nSelect I1 Change Locale and make sure you set the locale to en_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8, if in another country set the locale accordingly. You will be prompted to select the locale again as the default locale in the next dialog box.\nNavigate back to 5 Internationalisation Options and select I2 Change Timezone, select your geographical area followed by your city or region. In my case I am selecting Europe followed by London.\nNavigate back to 5 Internationalisation Options, The Change Keyboard Layout option can be ignored, generally it defaults to Generic 105-key (Intl) PC, which is perfectly acceptable in most cases. Select I4 Change Wi-Fi Country, this enables you to select your Wi-Fi region to ensure that your Raspberry Pi's Wi-Fi complies with the channel regulations of your country, I am selecting GB Britain (UK).\nNext select 9 Advanced Options. If you are experiencing black bars around your display you may need to enable Overscan, do this by selecting A1 Overscan and Select Yes when prompted. If your display is fine you can ignore this option.\nSelect 9 Advanced Options again and select A2 Hostname. Here you can specify the hostname as it will appear on your network, this comes in especially handy for identification purposes if you have more than one Raspberry Pi device on your network. The default hostname is retropie, I'm setting mine to ARCade Reactor.\nNote: Hostnames are not case-sensitive and only the following characters are permitted A-Z, 0-9 and hyphen '-', the hostname cannot begin or end with a hyphen.\nYou can now TAB to the Finish option and select Yes to reboot now, this completes the RetroPie's basic set-up.\nNote:You may have noticed the Overclock option under the config menu, this is beyond the scope of this Instructable. Some of the more demanding emulators (i.e. the N64 and the Dreamcast) will almost certainly require overclocking for some games to run more smoothly, I recommend you research the pros and cons of overclocking thoroughly before proceeding, heat sinks are also a must! My electronics and assembly instructions in Steps 7 - 9 allow for the addition of a chassis cooling fan to aid overclocking.\nFor a complete beginners guide to setting up RetroPie, check out this video from TechTipsta.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FV5/6V8Q/IR80ZGPB/FV56V8QIR80ZGPB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Installing and Configuring RetroPie"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Configure Gamepad\nIf you haven't already you can plug-in your gamepad (if using a PS3 Wireless Bluetooth controller this is covered in the Step 6).

Your Pi should then reboot and detect the gamepad. At this stage you need to follow the on-screen prompts to set up the button configuration, for help with configuring gamepads check out this GitHub page.\nNote:You may need to install additional drivers to enable support for XBox controllers, there is a video tutorial here.\nConfigure WiFi\nOnce your gamepad is functional you should be able to navigate the Emulation Station menu, scroll to RetroPie and select it by pressing the A button. From the list of options select WIFI and do the following:\nSelect Connect to WiFi network\nSelect your WiFi network name from the list\nEnter your WiFi password / passphrase\nSelect Ok\nOnce connected it will return you to the Configure Wifi box but should display your IP and SSID above it\nAdding ROMS (Games)\nThere are two main methods to add ROMS to RetroPie. One is over the network via a file transfer application such as WinSCP or FileZilla, the other is via the use of USB media such as a memory stick. Both of these methods are outlined below and links to additional information are also provided.\nNetwork File Transfer Method\nThis allow you to connect to your Pi via a Secure (SSH) FTP connection using the following connection settings:\nProtocol: SFTP\nHostname: As set in the previous step (alternatively use the Pi's IP address)\nUsername and Password: By default this is pi and raspberry\nOnce connected drop your ROMS into the relevant system folder in the following path: ~/RetroPie/roms/system\nNote:If the hostname will not resolve and you are unsure of the Pi's IP address you can find it by going to RetroPie Options from the main menu and selecting the \"Show IP address\" option.\nUSB Memory Stick Method\nThis allows you to transfer your ROMS via the use of a USB stick, but before this will work you need to do some prep work on the USB stick, as described below:\nFormat your USB stick to the FAT32 file system\nCreate a folder called retropie in the root of the USB stick\nConnect the USB stick to the Pi and wait for the status LED to stop flashing (it will create the folder structure automatically)\nRemove the USB stick from the Pi and connect it to your computer\nAdd the roms to the relevant folders (i.e. retropie/roms/system)\nPlug the USB stick back into the Pi (it will transfer the ROMS from the USB stick to the Pi's SD card automatically)\nWait for the USB stick status LED to stop flashing then refresh Emulation Station by choosing quit from the start menu\nAdditional Information\nIt is also possible to transfer ROMS by using the SMB (Samba) protocol or manually copying them from a USB stick with the RetroPie file manager. These methods as well as the ones outlined above are explained in more detail on the following GitHub page.\nFor a complete beginners guide to setting up RetroPie, check out this video from TechTipsta.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKA/VW95/IR80ZHPC/FKAVW95IR80ZHPC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Configuring Gamepad, Wi-Fi and Adding ROMS (Games)"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Installing Kodi\nIf you would like to add media player functionality to your RetroPie I'd recommend installing Kodi (formerly XBMC). At the time of writing Kodi for RetroPie is considered to be experimental, but it seems to work fairly well.\nTo install, follow these steps (you require an active internet connection):\nFrom the Emulation Station menu navigate to RetroPie and enter RetroPie Setup\nScroll down to 4 Experimental packages and select Ok\nScroll down to 307 - Kodi - Open source home theatre software and select Ok then wait for the package to download/install\nOnce complete you will be returned to RetroPie Setup, select Cancel a couple of times to return to the EmulationStation menu\nRestart EmulationStation and you'll find that Kodi is now listed under Ports\nAdding Kodi to Emulation Station's menu\nYou may wish to launch Kodi from the Emulation Station menu without having to navigate to Ports first, to do this follow these instructions:\nExit to the command line or connect via a SSH terminal such as Putty\nOpen the ~RetroPie/roms path\nType the following command mkdir kodi and press Enter to create a directory named kodi\nType cd kodi and press enter to open the new directory\nType the following command sudo nano kodi.sh and press enter to create and edit a new script\nType the following into the nano text editor\n#!/bin/bash\n\"/opt/retropie/supplementary/runcommand/runcommand.sh\" 0 _PORT_ kodi\nHit CTRL-X and then press Y to save and confirm changes then run the following command sudo chmod 777 /home/pi/RetroPie/roms/kodi/kodi.sh to set the permissions for the script file\n7. Open the ~etc/emulationstation path, type sudo nano es_systems.cfg and press Enter. Input the following text into the editor at the end but before /systemList.\n<system>\n    <fullname>Kodi</fullname>\n    <name>kodi</name>\n    <path>~/RetroPie/roms/kodi</path>\n    <extension>.sh .SH</extension>\n    <command>%ROM%</command>\n    <platform>kodi</platform>\n    <theme>kodi</theme>\n  </system>\nHit CTRL-X then Y to save and confirm then type sudo reboot to restart the Pi. Kodi should now be visible from the Emulation Station menu.\nFor further reference you can follow TechTipsta's YouTube tutorial for installing Kodi on RetroPie, this includes instructions for custom artwork and controller support.\nUSB HDD's and the Raspberry Pi\nBy default RetroPie and Kodi should auto-mount your USB HDD on start-up and it should be accessible, provided your drive is formatted to a supported file system (FAT32 is generally recommended for cross-platform support). If for any reason your USB HDD is not mounted automatically, follow this guide to Properly Mount USB Storage on Raspberry Pi.\nUSB Storage of Media for Kodi\nYou can save your media files (music, movies etc.) on your USB drive and access them via Kodi. You can either copy the files to your USB drive via your computer, or if you have already mounted your HDD inside the enclosure you can use SFTP file transfer tools such as WinSCP or FileZilla to upload the media files over the network.\nRunning ROMS from USB Storage\nIf you'd like to have your ROMS run from a USB drive instead of the SD card (can be handy if you have a small SD card) you can follow this guide from the RetroPie Github page.\nCD / DVD Drives and the Raspberry Pi\nThe Raspberry Pi is (typically) compatible with USB CD/DVD (and Blu-Ray) drives, however compatibility does seem to vary between different makes and models. At the time of writing my DVD drive install is still at the experimental stage as I am having some difficulties with getting my particular drive (unknown make/model) to work.\nNote:While playback of audio CD's and DVD-Video is well within the capability of the Pi (I'd recommend installing the MPEG-2 hardware codec license, more info on this here), Blu-Ray video playback though is a bridge too far.\nWireless (Bluetooth) Controllers\nRetroPie supports the use of wireless gamepads and controllers that comply with the Bluetooth standard. This means that wireless Playstation 3 controllers work just fine, but wireless XBox controllers unfortunately do not (without the use of a third party wireless receiver, available here and here). For your reference I have provided a link to an XBox controller tutorial on YouTube by Herb Fargus.\nTo configure RetroPie to work with your wireless PS3 controller follow these steps:\nBrowse to RetroPie in the EmulationStation menu\nLaunch RetroPie Setup\nSelect option 3 Setup / Configuration\nSelect 811 Install/Pair PS3 controller\nSelect 1 Install/Pair PS3 controller\nYou now need to connect your PS3 controller via USB to the Pi\nThen disconnect the controller from the USB connection and press the PS button to connect via Bluetooth\nThe PS3 controller should now be working wirelessly\nNote:There is a known problem with the Bluetooth driver that's provided with some of the Raspbian builds that causes the Pi to crash and/or freeze peridocally. This problem typically affects the built-in Bluetooth adapter on the Pi 3 (third party adapters are unaffected). If you encounter this problem I have included the fix in Step 10.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDS/F44R/IR80ZO1I/FDSF44RIR80ZO1I.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Installing Kodi, USB HDD, DVD and Wireless Controllers (Optional)"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "In order to power all of the components (Pi, USB hub, USB HDD etc.) from a single power input it is necessary to use a custom power supply and control board.

Take all the necessary safety precautions when using chemicals. Gloves and eye protection are a must. Always read the label and follow the product safety guidelines.\nAssemble the Circuit\nAssemble all of the components as indicated by the schematic and the PCB layout files. If you are printing your own PCB I have also provided a top layer layout for you, this will help you identify the correct location for the components when soldering.\nThe PICAXE Program\nBefore putting your microcontroller into the IC socket you'll want to program it with the code. If you are unfamiliar with the PICAXE here is the official Getting Started guide, there are also numerous I'bles that cover this subject. The code I'm using is shown below:\nstart0:\n    low C.1\n    low C.2\n    low C.4\n    if pinC.3 = 0 then\n      pwmout C.2,150,25\n    endif\n    do\n        pause 10\n    loop until pinC.3 = 1\n    pause 1000\n    PWMOUT C.2, OFF\n    pause 250\n    high C.2\n    pause 500\n    low C.2\n    pause 250\n    high C.2\n    pause 500\n    low C.2\n    pause 250\n    high C.2\n    high C.1\n    pause 500\n    do\n        pause 10\n    loop until pinC.3 = 0\n    high C.4\n    low C.2\n    pause 1000\n    high C.2\n    pause 1000\n    low C.2\n    pause 1000\n    high C.2\n    pause 1000\n    low C.2\n    pause 1000\n    high C.2\n    pause 1000\n    low C.2\n    pause 1000\n    high C.2\n    pause 1000\n    low C.2\n    pause 1000\n    high C.2\n    pause 1000\n    low C.2\n    pause 1000\n    high C.2\n    pause 1000\n    low C.2\n    pause 1000\n    high C.2\n    pause 1000\n    low C.2\n    pause 1000\n    high C.2\n    pause 1000\n    reset\n    stop\nTo summarise, the code is performing the following steps:\nSets all output pins to low (off)\nChecks if the power switch (Pin C3) is off then dims the status LED via PWM\nLoops until the power switch is on\nWhen the power switch is on it turns off PWM\nFlashes the LED three times and switches on the Relay (Pin C1)\nLoops until the power switch is turned off\nWhen the power switch is turned off it switches Pin C4 to high\nPin C4 sends a 3.3v high signal to the Raspberry Pi to trigger shutdown script\nFlashes the LED at a slower rate ten times to indicate shutdown in progress\nSwitches Pin C1 low to switch off the Relay\nRestarts the code\nWhen the reset button is pushed it sends a high signal to Pin C5, this triggers the PICAXE to reset.\nNote:The centre pin of the 3-pin MTA connectors are not soldered when using the custom PCB, this is due to the high risk of the centre pin bridging the adjoining pins due to the wider copper tracks. Be sure to test everything before hooking it up to your Raspberry Pi as you don't want to risk damaging anything if something goes wrong during the build.\nTip: If your copper PCB board is not supporting your required current capacity, consider using a board with a higher weight copper. Alternatively you can thicken the copper traces with solder to reduce the resistance.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSX/7P7W/IQYSY54D/FSX7P7WIQYSY54D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQA/N4DG/IR9EAWVT/FQAN4DGIR9EAWVT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7K/E3FP/IQYT27RO/F7KE3FPIQYT27RO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMI/TDP6/IQYT27RM/FMITDP6IQYT27RM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7S/XHY3/IRG4LVFN/F7SXHY3IRG4LVFN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXA/7VDG/IRG4LVFQ/FXA7VDGIRG4LVFQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Electronics and Wiring"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Tip:Make sure that your Raspberry Pi is up and running and everything works before you go ahead with the internal assembly, there is nothing worse than having to take something apart again because you failed to discover a potential problem earlier in the build process.\nThe ARCade Reactor is designed to make use of the existing mounting posts located within the original NES enclosure via the use of custom designed 3d printed parts (included with the Instructable). These will securely mount the Pi, USB Hub, HDD, DVD, optional Cooling Fan and the various other cables and connectors. Secure the 3d printed mounts with the mounting screws you saved from Step 2.\nAs part of the process you will either need to make a modified CAT5/CAT5e ethernet cable or source a low-profile one, this is due to the tight space in which the connector needs to fit (as illustrated in the photos). To mod the cable you'll need a RJ45 crimping kit (crimp tool, CAT5 cable, stripper, RJ45 connector) and a hacksaw.\nWith the hacksaw cut the RJ45 connector in half (approximately), being sure to keep the cable retention clip\nNow terminate the shortened RJ45 connector to the 568A or 568B wiring standards. You'll want the cable to be approximately 25-30cm long\nNote:If you are unfamiliar with the process of terminating RJ45 connectors here is a guide provided by the Cable Organizer Learning Center.\nYou will also need to cut/drill the mounting holes for the DC power input socket and master power switch, the dimensions of these will vary depending on your choice of switch and socket.

Fortunately there is a relatively straight forward fix to resolve this issue, just run these commands from the terminal / command line and it should resolve the issue:\nsudo apt-get install rpi-update\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo sed -i 's/curl/curl -k/g' /usr/bin/rpi-update\nsudo UPDATE_SELF=0 rpi-update 15ffab5493d74b12194e6bfc5bbb1c0f71140155\nwget http://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian/pool/main/p/pi-bluetooth/pi-bluetooth_0.1.0_armhf.deb\nsudo dpkg -i pi-bluetooth_0.1.0_armhf.deb\nUtilise the Original NES Controller Ports on the Raspberry Pi and RetroPie\nIf you really want to add some authenticity to your Retro gaming experience why not use an original gamepad? As I've built mine in the NES I decided to make use of the controller ports so you can play with an original NES controller. To achieve this I purchased a couple of NES RetroKits from RetroUSB.com, the small kit allows you to connect NES (and SNES) controllers via USB. Full assembly instructions are provided by RetroUSB.\nEasily Change the Order of Player/Controller Number Assignment Without Modifying RetroArch Manually\nI found that after I connected the RetroUSB adapters my primary controller (the PS3) got relegated to player 3. This meant I was not able to play most of my games with the PS3 controller anymore as they only recognised P1 and P2 (now assigned to the RetroUSB). RetroPie is largely based around RetroArch, and while this can be customised and modified it's not something I'm particularly familiar with, and to be honest I don't want to get too involved with it. I found a simple solution to the problem on GitHub, RetroPie Joystick Selection(formerly Input Selection). This neat little package integrates into RetroPie and allows you to assign your controllers to different player numbers with ease.\nPlaystation 3 Controller Mod\nTo keep up with the Iron Man theme of my ARCade Reactor I decided to paint my PS3 controller in the same radiant red as I painted the NES case. To do this simply take your PS3 controller apart and paint, (using my painting guide in Step 3 as a reference). I also replaced the PS button with an Iron Man Arc Reactor button, I got this from JMods.\nRaspberryPi Shutdown Script - Integrates with the Custom Power Management Circuit (PMC) in Step 7\nThere may be occasions where you want to perform a clean shutdown of your Raspberry Pi without the need to do it from the user interface or SSH terminal. To achieve this I designed the PMC to include a 3.3v output to trigger a shutdown script on the Pi. Simply connect the PMC to the Pi's GPIO (I used BCM port 23 and ground). You'll then need to create the script and enable it to run as a process on the Pi, the steps are shown below.\nPerform sudo nano /etc/arcade_off.sh to create and edit a new script file, then enter the following code:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n# Import RPi.GPIO and OS\nimport RPi.GPIO as GPIO\nimport os \n\n# Init GPIO Port\nGPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM) # Set numbering convention to BCM GPIO\nGPIO.setup(23, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_DOWN) # Set pin 23 as pull-down input\nGPIO.wait_for_edge(23, GPIO.RISING) # Wait for pull up on Pin 23 \n\n# Pin 23 pull-up action\nos.system('poweroff') # Performs shutdown\nHit CTRL-X and then Y to confirm and save, then perform sudo nano /etc/rc.local and add the following line at the bottom but before exit 0.\n/etc/arcade_off.sh &\nScripts specified here will run on startup, the '&' specifies that this script will run as a background process.\nSplashscreens\nSplashscreens displayed on start-up can be chosen from a list of pre-installed alternatives or a custom made one can be uploaded, video splashscreens are also supported. View the Splashscreen guide on RetroPie's GitHub.\nEmulators within RetroPie\nYou'll find that some of the systems within RetroPie have the option of more than one emulator. While most systems will play happily with the default emulator you'll find that some of the more advanced ones (such as the Nintendo64) will require you to tweak the settings to get the best performance depending on the ROM you are trying to run. See the Supported Systems list on RetroPie's GitHub for more information.\nScreen Size and Overscan\nIf you have black bars around your display or your display is being cropped, you may need to toggle overscan on or off. This can be configured using raspi-config.\nThanks for reading...\nHope you find this Instructable helpful, if you have any comments or queries just let me know.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ5/MYU9/IRG4HWGW/FJ5MYU9IRG4HWGW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZK/7AAV/IR9EFW8W/FZK7AAVIR9EFW8W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOR/TL4A/IR9EFWFL/FORTL4AIR9EFWFL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: Tweaks and Customisation (Optional)"}], "channel": "Video Games"}, {"category": "Play", "description": "Introduction\nAt dinner one night the conversation drifted to Microsoft Office Assistance, Clippy. When my eldest daughter, a teenager, said she loved him. I was surprised, but confessed I miss him. My wife said she strongly disliked him. My daughter also said she would love to have him. Later on I thought about it and said sure I can make him.\nBefore we start making a Clippy Bobble, during my research, I learned that there is plenty of material describing the love / hate relation with him. He was cute, annoying, educated, frustrating with little social skills what so ever. He was introduced in Office 97 refined in Office 2000. Retired 2 years later and was left behind after Office 2003. During his tenure he did help a lot of users, comics and columnist.

The cooling radiator on the back is insulated against the extreme cold on the planet Hoth.\nMy K'NEX model is 16.5 cm long and uses only 131 parts and is thereby my smallest Star Wars model that I've built so far. The model has a windshield that can open (but not like in the movie) and Air-brake flaps, to enable very tight turns. Also a Harpoon is positioned in the back, just like in the real aircraft.

With some imagination and some scrounging you should be able to do this pretty inexpensively as well.", "title": "Floating Lightsaber Flow Prop", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Floating-Lightsaber-Flow-Prop/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "BLADE\nThe tubing I used for the blade is a 32\" length of 1\" OD x 3/4\" ID polycarbonate tubing that I bought from amazon, at about $30 for 6 feet (enough for two sabers). It is also available with many other options like frosting, tinting, etc. from thecustomsabershop.com. You can also use thinner wall material if you want a lighter prop - the 1/8\" wall is recommended if you plan on battling your friends with it.\nTheblade tipis from thecustomsabershop.com for $5.50 at the time I bought it. Make sure you get the right tip for the tubing you use.\nTo diffuse the light evenly along the blade, you need some kind of film or treatment. There are many ways to do this, from frosted tubing, to fiber optics to phosphorescent coatings... I chose the cheapest method that appears to yield good results, which is to roll up somecellophane wrapping paperin the middle of the tube to refract the light down the center instead of just letting it all out the sides.\nLIGHT SOURCE\nThis is a huge can of worms, upon which there is a vast amount of information available. Some saber builders have done amazing things with ultra high output emitters, but I just wanted something that would produce enough light to look cool in the dark, not necessarily rival the sun, so I used:\nA Cheap 3w red LED from eBay (about $1) on a star heat sink.\nA collimating lens that narrows the viewing angle to 8 degrees (also about $1 on ebay)\nA 1000mA constant current driver (also from ebay - about 2 bucks).\nNote: pictured above you can see I also tested a green emitter; green LEDs are more efficient than red, and are brighter to your eye even at the same output, however I wanted red for this build so I took the performance hit.\nBATTERIES\nI happened to have several dozen used 18650 lithium ion batteries laying around. The driver board I used needs between 5 and 30 volts to work, so I put two batteries in series (2x3.7v nominal = 7.4v) and called it a day. There are many, many ways you could power this, depending on what you have available, that's small enough to fit inside your handle. 18650 batteries are just under 3/4\" in diameter and so worked perfectly inside my handle tubing.\nI used button switch from a cheap led flashlightthat happened to be the exact diameter of my handle tubing. This simplified my wiring and kept there from being any irregularities in the round handle, which is important for the contact rolling moves I wanted this prop for.\nHANDLE\nFor the handle itself I used 1\" OD aluminum tubingfor the handle itself, and some1\" ID x 1.25 OD aluminum pipeas a coupling to connect the 1\" OD blade tubing with the 1\" OD handle, without creating a large bump along the length of the prop - remember the idea here is to keep it as much like a long smooth cylinder as possible for the rolling moves.\nCOUNTERWEIGHT\nThe heavy pommel is what makes this a floating sword. Commercial props sometimes use a steel ball, but I don't have machining facilities to put a bolt hole in one. You could use a bunch of big washers around a bolt screwed into the end - I usedlead sheet that I cut to 2\" wide tape and wrapped in several layers around the end until the balance point was where I wanted it to be.\nOTHER ODDS & ENDS\nI improvised the battery retainer and so on, reusing some of the other parts from the flashlight I cannibalized, and a small PVC fitting. I also used some rivets, tape, glue, grip tape, foam tape, fiberglass cloth and epoxy resin. I will cover this in detail later on, but I will imagine anyone else making this will probably do things at least a little bit differently.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIR/TI8Z/IRKFMR65/FIRTI8ZIRKFMR65.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8F/O9H8/IRKFMR9N/F8FO9H8IRKFMR9N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKJ/S8V4/IRKFMR88/FKJS8V4IRKFMR88.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F87/TW6A/IRKFMR6U/F87TW6AIRKFMR6U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFI/0ODS/IRKFMRS5/FFI0ODSIRKFMRS5.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Step 1 - Materials"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The first thing I did, because it had the most stuff to figure out in it, was to make the handle part. The handle has to hold your batteries, switch, grip, counterweight, and couple to the blade portion of the prop, so I wanted to get it going early and give myself time to scratch my head over the details as I went along.\nI missed some detailed photos on these steps, but they are very simple and go something like this:\nCut the 15\" length of 1\" OD tubing - note: it's advisable to cut this 1\" too long at this point.\nDeburr the tube, and mark it at 1\" from the cleaned up end\nApply grease or anti-seize compound as a lubricant to the OD of the end of the tube.\nUsing a dead-blow mallet, carefully hammer the 1\" OD tube into the end of the 1\" ID tube until it reaches the mark you made on the smaller tube. During this process be very careful to keep the axes of the two tubes aligned - the metal is fragile and can be bent. Don't get over-zealous with your hammer or you will buckle the handle.\nAt this point you will likely have damaged the end of the handle tubing with the mallet, so you'll be happy you left an extra inch in step one. You can now trim this off. I like to use some duct tape as a cutting guide to get square cuts - a miter box also works.\nCut the 1.25\" OD tube down to its final length. I wanted a bit of style to it so I put a 45 degree cut. The measurements of this are 2\" on the short side and 3.25\" on the long side.\nPlace your coupling in a vice, and use the top of the jaws as a cutting guide to put a lengthwise cut in the coupling. I also drilled a 3/8\" hole at the root of this lengthwise cut. The idea here is to make the blade end of the coupling more flexible than the handle end, so I can get the weaker polycarbonate to slide in without it buckling.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDI/0JHU/IRO1H8OZ/FDI0JHUIRO1H8OZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDA/K34B/IRO1H8OM/FDAK34BIRO1H8OM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJM/BUQW/IRO1H8OY/FJMBUQWIRO1H8OY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAW/4XPY/IRO1H8P5/FAW4XPYIRO1H8P5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH8/6JEN/IRO1H8PE/FH86JENIRO1H8PE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRJ/A70R/IRKFMRCT/FRJA70RIRKFMRCT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Step 2: Assemble the Handle and Blade Coupling"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "This step, of all steps, I imagine the most people will want to do differently than I did.

This simplifies wiring, as you then just need to connect the lamp to the body and to battery positive.\nThe easiest way I could think of to get a threaded flashlight tail cap, complete with switch, to work with my saber, was just to stick the back half of a flashlight on the end of the tube. I accomplished this by cutting the flashlight body in half, and then wrapping epoxy/fiberglass composite around that to make it all one piece.

Make sure the roll stays mostly non-spiraled, and your finger should be released.\nSlide the cellophane back out a little ways so that there is room at one end to insert your blade tip. Place the blade tip in but do not glue it in place. You're just trying to get the cellophane placed right at this point. Mark the cellophane at the other end of the tube.\nPull the cellophane out a few inches, and cut the roll off with a sharp pair of scissors about 1/2\"-3/4\" shorter than the mark you made.

Also it goes without saying that it pays to test your circuits at every step so you don't get too far and realize something doesn't work.\nIf your LED is not already on a star, install it on one. These standard heat sinks are a necessity if you want your LED to last any amount of time. The LEDs I used are relatively pedestrian 3W units but they definitely generate enough heat to require sinking. If you're using a sweet tri-cree or something, you will need an even larger sink. It's recommended to use thermal compound between the back of the LED and the star base when you do this.\nSolder wire leads to your LED\nTo make the collimating lens a snug fit inside the blade tube, I wrapped it in white vinyl tape until it was the exact diameter to require just a bit of force to fit.\nPlace your taped up collimating lens over the LED.

It's a good idea to test your electronics, as after this it gets significantly more difficult to access them.\nTest your LED and driver board.\nMount the handle in a vise as shown - so that the coupling rests against the side of the vice. This way you don't have to squeeze your handle and potentially damage it.\nThread your wires through the handle tube so that your wiring comes out the bottom - every wiring step from here on has to be done from the bottom, so make sure you're ready before you get out your mallet.\nCarefully tap the polycarbonate blade tube into the coupling on the end of your handle. Polycarbonate is extremely tough, but if you hit it too hard you can buckle it, leaving permanent crease marks or stress fractures in it.\nAs you're doing this, the star base of your LED will get pushed up against the end of the 1\" OD handle tube inside your coupling.

The driver board for the LED is happy as long as it gets between 5 and 30 volts; two (3.7v nominal) lithium cells in series will give me 7.4v nominal to work with. It would work to just put two cylindrical cells in with the (+) end of one touching the (-) end of the other, like in most flashlights, but I wanted to eliminate as much potential movement within the handle as I could, so I actually soldered two cells (+) to (-) and then taped them up.\nNow, my flashlight tail cap switch is going to connect battery negative to the handle housing; this means I need to connect the battery (-) terminal on my LED driver to the flashlight housing (See diagram). Unfortunately because I connected the aluminum housing to the handle with epoxy, I don't have an electrical path from there to where the LED is, and I needed to run the battery (-) wire all the way to the flashlight housing to connect it. Lesson learned for next time.\nWhat remains to do is put a plug into the handle tube that is insulated from the handle, but contains a spring contact to make the connection between battery (+) terminal and the LED driver battery (+) terminal. I found that a 1/2\" PVC plug was almost exactly the right diameter to slide inside my handle tube. Here is how I made the rest of the battery plug:\nSand or grind the flange off of your PVC fitting so it will slide into the tube.\nWrap a few layers of electrical tape around the PVC fitting to make it a snug fit inside the tube.\nTake apart the rest of your cheap flashlight and salvage the battery (+) connection from it.\nIn mine, the battery spring was soldered right to the PCB that hosted the flashlight's LEDs, so the LEDs needed to be removed.\nRough up your PVC and your PCB with some sandpaper and epoxy them together as shown. Once the epoxy cures, sand/grind off any excess PCB around the edges so the assembly still slides into your handle tube.\nDrill a small hole through the plug for your (+) wire, and grind a slot into the side of your plastic plug for the (-) wire.\nYou can avoid running the (-) wire in this way if your handle is continuously conductive from where the LED is to the switch - you would just connect your battery (-) wire to the handle housing up near the blade instead of at the switch.\nPoke your your (+) wire through the hole in your plug and solder it to one of the contacts connected to the spring (or just solder to the spring directly). Test your connections before going further.\nWith your (-) wire hanging out of the end, insert your plastic plug into the handle tube, with the (-) wire going through the slot in the side of your plug.\nYou want the plug to be somewhat difficult to move inside the handle so it doesn't get away from you.\nMake sure you keep hold of the (-) wire so it doesn't get pulled along with your plug as you push it in.\nUsing some sort of implement carefully push the plug into the handle, checking your batteries for fitment every so often. Don't push it in too far, or you'll have a very unfortunate problem on your hands.\nOnce your (+) plug is in the correct spot, carefully drill through the side of the handle, and into your plastic plug; rivet or glue it in place through the side of the handle tube. Test your connections again to make sure you didn't break a wire with your drill bit.\nAt this point the only thing you are missing is the LED driver (-) connection to the flashlight housing. I got excited and channeled my inner kludge monster at this point and just stripped the wire and made sure it got trapped in the threads when I screwed the tail cap on.

The whole point for me was making one that I could do contact moves with though, so this step is vital.\nDISCLAIMER: In case you're unawares, lead is toxic. It makes an excellent weight because it's extremely dense, and easy to form into whatever shape you want, but it is notoriously bad for humans - wash your hands, and perhaps read up on the negative effects lead can have on your health before you proceed. My design fully encapsulates the lead in a silicone sheath, so it will be contained, but you still have to work with it. If in doubt, use steel or brass, or some other material to make your counterweight.\nThe first thing I needed to do was to cut my 4\" wide lead sheet in half to make a 2\" wide by 36\" long strip. Ordinary household scissors work just fine for this but should be carefully cleaned or discarded afterwards.\nYou may want to play with how much lead you use to adjust where the balance point of the prop is. This amount with the materials I used put the balance point halfway between the blade and the pommel end.\nTape the end of your lead strip to the handle, and start applying silicone adhesive.\nI used DOW 732 because it's awesome, but I'm sure any old silicone would be fine.\nMake sure to get a nice even, thin coat, wrapping the lead around as you go, so each layer gets glued to the layer below it.\nOnce you have the whole strip rolled around the hilt, gently twist your rolled up lead to tighten the wrapping and squeeze out any excess silicone. Using your finger, smear silicone all over the outside of the lead and the edges to prevent contact between lead and the outside world.\nOptional: Using weatherstripping or insulating duct tape, build up a contour on the handle, and over-wrap the lead weight to provide a little bit of padding - it's no fun to catch an un-padded lead weight in the face if you mess up a move. A little bit of padding goes a very long way. A layer of tightly wrapped electrical tape over top of your foam tape will hold it firmly in place and give you a nice even black pommel.\nApply grip tape - this is pretty self explanatory.\nI used baseball bat grip because I was in a rush. I don't like this stuff because its kind of overpriced for what you get.\nTennis racket over-grip works too, and is pretty easy to find; there are many long winded discussions online to be found about what works best; whatever you use will probably come with instructions.\nOptional: Mark the balance point.\nThis is very useful for performing rapid visual calculations while you're spinning the prop around.

The cauldron has a very magical effect: inside, there's a bubble machine that blows bubbles upwards, as well as a line of UV LEDs. In combination with UV bubble fluid, in the dark you will see glowing bubbles emerge from the cauldron. As often, the effect is hard to catch on a smartphone camera, but it actually is really beautiful.\n\nNow, there is another story to how I came to building this, and I think it's worth telling: last year, I constructed my bicycle bubble machine and published it. On thingiverse, a user commented that this machine would be really cool using UV bubble fluid and corresponding LEDs. I had never heard of UV bubble fluid before, I was intrigued by the idea, but my budget for tinkering was completely exhausted by my first 3D printer I had built that year. So I answered: I'll go for it somewhen, but, frankly, I'm broke. This read another thingiverse user, overflo from Vienna. He had a spare bag of 50 UV LEDs lying around, liked my machine and obviously likes to give back to others -- two weeks later, the LEDs arrived by mail, complete with corresponding resistors, a wired example and a helpful letter, because I had told him I'm rather an electronics beginner. A year passed by and I didn't get down to building something with the LEDs, until now. Well, it's not for the bicycle, I did face a lot of problems, I did a lot of mistakes, but I like my magic cauldron, despite all difficulties and shortcomings. And: I finally put overflo's LEDs to good use.\nPlease note: This instructable makes use of electricty and lots of fluids, two things that don't mix well.

Every machine I could find was working horizontally, which is due to the way nearly 100 % of bubble machines are constructed: you have a wheel with bubble wands, which dip into the bubble liquid when they're low, and pass a fan when they're up high. So what I needed was a vertical bubble machine. I could think of two ways of building this: my first idea was to use a belt system, with holes in the belt, instead of bubble wands. Using four rollers the belt could pass low through the liquid; the fan would be mounted in the middle of the belt.\nSome things seemed complicated to me and I didn't have much time before our vacation and the wizarding contest deadline, so I setttled for a different approach: a classical Ferris wheel, again with the fan mounted in the middle. The vertical bubble machine uses a simple 80x80mm fan for blowing the bubbles and a small gear motor for turning the wheel.\nThe magical glowing effect is realized by UV-A LEDs that sit just under the edge of the cauldron, directed upwards, and by using a UV active bubble fluid, like its sometimes used at partys or discos. The effect is of course most impressive when it's getting dark.\nWhile up to here everything worked like expected, my decision to make a cauldron of my own, first trying it with papier mach\u00e9, then with plaster, really wasn't worth it.

I then bought this (80x80x38mm L\u00fcfter M-FAN DC DZ08038B12HA) which clearly seemed to be overkill. But it had the advantage that it did a just right air flow when driven at only 5V and this way I could use just one stepdown switching regulator for both motors.\na few small M3 screws and nuts to attach the fan to the fan mount.\nSuper Glue\nwater-tight foil (for alternatives, see later)\nthe printed parts.

I embedded a video with only the bubble machine to show this nice effect.\n\nBuilding it is straight forward. Take a look at the pictures. On a WebGL enabled browser (not in the instructables mobile app, sorry) you can also consult this interactive rendering, which also allows you to gradually change to an exploded view:\nFor those without WebGL, I attached a PDF drawing.\n\nFirst, print all the pieces -- dont' care much about infill, as everything's pretty flat anyhow. I normally use three perimeters, but nothing will be strained very much in this machine. It's up to you, which of the bubble rings you use -- I like to mix the smaller two types for the cauldron, but mix all types of rings when using it as a normal bubble machine.\n\nSee the assembly drawing I made in Fusion 360 as to how to put it all together. First mount the side pieces on the base plate; put the wheels on the side pieces. Now, first mount the fan and the motor on the fan mount plate, the fan with a few M3 screws and nuts (you don't have to take long ones and go through upper and lower holes, if you only got short screws, just go through the lower holes of the fan only), the motor just press-fit; please note that in the end I decided to stick the fan mount up-side-down, as compared to the interactive design and the PDF drawing: it doesn't really matter, but I thought this shields the little motor and its connections better from splashing liquid from above. However you do it, when mounted, the fan should be on the upside of the fan mount plate. The fan mount plate is pressed into the hollow shafts in the side pieces. The small geared motor has to be mounted so the small pinion meshes with the larger gear. Last step, push the bubble rings in the wheels, connecting both wheels.\n\nThe wires from the motor and fan go through one of the hollow shafts to the outside (see the photo).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZC/EWLE/IRGZYFXM/FZCEWLEIRGZYFXM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQG/3G4N/IRGZZB6L/FQG3G4NIRGZZB6L.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: The Core: a Vertical Bubble Machine"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "A word of caution: you don't need to do what I did.

I then spent a lovely evening with my kids, tearing newspapers, dipping them in wallpaper glue and putting it on the balloon. We let it dry and repeated. Let it dry and repeated.

Let it dry and repeated. Let it dry and repeated. Covered some cable channel with plaster strips for the edge, as well as printed feet. Let it dry.\nCut open the balloon where the edge of the cauldron later would be and noticed the papier mach\u00e9 was still wet on the inside. Scratched it all out of our plaster balloon. Decided the structure of the strips came through too much. Went over it with normal plaster. Tried to sand it to make it more smooth. Forgot that I should do this outside, not in the living room. Tried to withstand my wife's nervous fit. Went outside to spray it bronze. Decided not to try anymore but just get going.\nToday by chance found that perfect planting trough in some store.

I using an LED stripe, where the single LEDs obviously can't easily be directed somewhere, I'd just mount it to the upper part of the round edge, so the whole stripe points upwards. If you don't have a bunch of UV LEDs lying around, there is no point in doing this complicated, use a stripe instead!\nWhile Flo sent me the corresponding resistors, I went the easy way: I had these constant current source chips designed especially for LEDs needing 20mA. They work like this: connect your DC input (in my case 32V) to one side, connect a daisy chain of LEDs to the other, without resistors; according to the documentation, with the 32V I had I could connect up to 8 LEDs per source, which I did. As the chips come as little SMD parts, I soldered little pin strips to the input side, so I could then solder them in parallel to a little stripe board, which again I connected to the 32V power supply.\nIf you buy LED stripes, you'll use a 12V power supply anyhow, and don't need any separate resistors as they're included.\nUse shrinking tube to isolate as much as possible of the bare wires.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYD/9WMN/IRGZZGWA/FYD9WMNIRGZZGWA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXJ/USX9/IRGZZFCT/FXJUSX9IRGZZFCT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQZ/NF5E/IRGZZF06/FQZNF5EIRGZZF06.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQK/GXAM/IRGZZD5V/FQKGXAMIRGZZD5V.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: The Magic: Wiring the LEDs"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "To make it alive, the wires from fan and motor, routed through the hole in the middle of one of the side walls, have to be connected to a stepdown regulator (5V), as well as the LEDs connected to the power supply.

This is the most crucial part of the model, so make sure everything can move smoothly.\nSince it is so crucial, I started with this part. I wanted to make the mechanism as small as possible. At first I used Medium size Crown gears, but they proved too big. I scaled down from a blue-rod cube to a white-rod cube. Because the wings still need to move, I had to use the orange 3D angle connectors. I try to use them as minimal as possible, because I know not many people have them, but here they are unreplacable.\nAs mentioned: the big wheel on top should make 2 parts move in clockwise and counter-clockwise direction.

Even as a kid, I was fascinated by bubbles and I remember how excited I was at our \u2018bubble-ology\u2019 class in grade school. However, pretty much the first thing I learned about bubbles was a lie. I distinctly remember my grade school teachers telling/showing me how bubbles always form a sphere, even if they are blown through a square wand. As you can see in the above photo, and my how-to video, none of these bubbles are spheres \u2013 most of them only \u2018blobs\u2019. I imagine many of you have lived believing the same lie.

One of the comments to his -ible a few years ago was from BubbleMama who shared another bubble recipe using guar gum. And that\u2019s essentially the recipe that I\u2019ve been using since. Soapbubble.wikia.com claims credit for making some of the first/best guar gum recipes, so I\u2019d better give a shout out to them too. Their site has tons of information about bubbles and I absolutely recommend checking them out. Thank you all for posting!\nMy family has spent hours blowing/chasing/popping these bubbles with brothers, sisters, cousins, grandparents \u2013 everyone. Some of them have taken the recipe and shared it too \u2013 it\u2019s just so much fun. Part of my reason for posting a well-known recipe is to put it up on my blog where my family can always find it when they need it. This bubble recipe is really easy to make, you can make it up in minutes and it can be used immediately or days later. Some folks make bubble making into a true science \u2013 that\u2019s not for me, but this recipe is very forgiving, you can \u2018eyeball\u2019 the ingredients and still have it turn out great! One note on this recipe, I live in the Eastern united states where it is quite humid most of the summer.

You get to learn how to perform this trick for your friends.\n\nExplain to your friends that all students were given a spell book during your first year at Wizarding School, but when you received your copy, it had no spells in it. The pages were completely blank. As you explain this, hold the book by the spine with your right hand. With you left hand flip through the pages at the TOP corner of the book and you will see all the pages are blank. (This is because of the pages we trimmed at the top corners)\n\nClose the book and explain that your assignment when you got the book was to figure out the magic word in order to see all the spells. Tell everyone that you tried many different magic spells until you finally found out that it was YOUR magic word (Mine is, \"Bazinga!\") You say the magic word and then, with your left hand, flip through the pages at the BOTTOM corner of the book. Now everyone will see that all the pages are printed with magic spells. (This is because of the pages we trimmed at the bottom corners)\n\nThe key on performing this is not to bring attention to the fact that your hand is in two different positions as you page through the book each time. The way to do that is to take a little bit of time between when you show the blank pages and when you show them printed so your audience will not notice where your hand was. This the moment when you should explain how you tried many different spells, but none of them worked. Then you position your hand at the bottom and page through and nobody will even notice.\n\nHave fun with this trick and remember that the first rule of magic is NOT to reveal the secret to your audience.\n\nCheck out my video as well to see how this trick is performed.\n\nFINAL NOTE: I made this book with a Harry Potter theme, but it can be made using any theme you wish. You can print out your own pages and cover art and still cut the pages as described. Be creative and have fun with this.\n\nI hope you enjoy making and performing this trick.\n\nIf you liked this Instructable please vote for it.

Something that children and adults can play alike? Looking for something simple to make yet captivating to keep people's attention? Well, look no further. Introducing the Modular Miniature Golf Course!\nThe Modular Mini Golf Course is a great way to add fun to your next event, party, office or anything really. It is quick and easy to build (we built the entire thing in about 2 days) and can be built entirely from materials found at Home Depot. The great part is, it can be easily and effortlessly broken down and moved to storage or another location.\nAfter coming up with the idea to build a miniature golf course with my friend, Shane, we decided to build it for our company's Hack-a-thon!\nSimilar to a bouldering wall, we designed this course to have several different routes to follow in order to get more holes than there are physical holes. A map shows golfers which routes to take to include starting points and ending cups. This allows us to have more than 12 routes for only 5 physical holes.\nAnother fun game to play is HORSE where the first golfer calls out a shot involving hitting the ball by or through certain areas. The next player then must match or beat the number of strokes it takes in order to not get a letter.\nThere really are countless ways to have fun with this project and the scope, size, and difficulty are only limited by your imagination!\nI have organized each step of this Instructable into 5 sections to try and make it as clear and easy to follow as possible:\n1) Step Aim: where I discuss what we will accomplish/create in this step.\n2) Tools: which tools will be required to perform this step.\n3) Materials: what materials from the part list will you need in this step.\n4) Directions: step by step directions for this particular component's construction.\n5) Tips: where I make note of any problems I ran into and ways to avoid them during your building process.\nAs some background, my name is Christian Reed and I am a 2014 Mechanical Engineering Graduate from MIT and an Army veteran.

We're here to let you customize (almost) every piece of it - on the fly.\nWith our modular pinball concept that also lets you customize the way you control it, you are challenged to come up with new way to play the machine. And you can change it however you like, just one new module or the entire table. We have built ours using a FabLab. If you know one near you, you're pretty much ready to go!", "title": "PINball", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/PINball-2/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The basic concept is this: The machine consists of autonomous modules that you swap out for new ones. Some modules might need input such as power or control signals. The latter are provided through a PINboard, basically a breadboard. This is the interface between the modules and the controllers. You can use many different controllers such as simple buttons, gamepads or shakers. But the fun part is: You decide what output controls which input. So instead of controlling the left flipper with the left button and vice versa for the right one, you could switch them up by simple plugging the pins on the PINboard in a different order. As you can see in the image above, you can even control two different modules by the same controller, as is the case with the shaker. Or you could use two controllers for two people and let each of them only control one flipper.\nTo accomplish this, the modules need to fit certain criterea. They must fit onto the grid that consists of squares with 5cmx5cm. They must comply to a fixed height of 15cm (from the ground to their top surface), which is chosen to accomodate the space needed for technology of complex modules, which has to be attached under the surface. The in- and outputs are fed through the bottom of the module and through holes in the grid and can be led to the power outlet and the PINboard.\nThe controllers might give continuous or discrete input, but the range must be between 0V and 5V. Modules can accept those input signals. For safety reasons, modules should be able to handle continuous input. You can insert a small microcontroller that converts it to a discrete signal, if necessary. With continuous signals, for example, you could control a stepper motor that acts as a seesaw on which the ball has to be balanced.\nThis is the basic concept you need to understand in order for everything to work together. Now let's start building!\nA few notes\nWe will be using mostly 5mm thick MDF sheets to be cut in a FabLab laser cutter.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHW/61SJ/IQGUTNIM/FHW61SJIQGUTNIM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBS/GVFS/IQK3OD4E/FBSGVFSIQK3OD4E.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Learn to Know the Concept"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The table was planned to be build out of precut wooden boards, however it was easier and cheaper to use scrap from the lab, which resulted in the table being altered a bit to accommodate the various dimensions of the scrap wood.\nWhere able we fixed the boards with screws and angles, where the wood was to thin to fit a screw we used nails. It is important to note, that the table itself is level with the ground. Only the grid holding the modules is slanted at an angle of 10%. To calculate the heights of the multiple supporting boards, as well as the walls is only a matter of simple trigonometry.\nThe dimensions of the playing field were largely determined by the grid size, the size of conventional pinball arcades and the dimensions of the scrap boards. It is 55x150cm, while the table itself is 60x126x151cm This allows for a maximum of 11 5x5cm modules in width and 30 5x5cm modules in height. Due to the horizontal table and the angled grid board, the room for cables and logic boards outside the modules gets fairly limited to the front (min of 5mm headroom), while being generous in the back. This means any bigger logic boards must be shifted to the back, but there is still enough room for cabling, while minimizing the height of the table.\nBecause our side boards were to low, we decided to heighten the walls with laser cut MDF, which has the benefit of being able to accommodate notches for placing the grid and overhead plexiglas as cover for the playing field. By using two glued together MDF boards at either side, we brought down the width of the playing area from 57cm to the planned 55cm while increasing overall stability.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8E/4GJ6/IQSCIPGJ/F8E4GJ6IQSCIPGJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTB/9VHI/IQSCIPGO/FTB9VHIIQSCIPGO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Build a Table"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "What you need\nMaterials:\n- 12mm x 18cm aluminium rod\n- M3x15mm screw and M3x15mm washer\n- Spring (9mm outer diameter, 1.3mm springwire)\n- PLA filament for the 3d printer\nTools:\n- metal lathe (oh yes exactly, I have one in every room...)\n- pointy bit to decrease diameter\n- 3mm drill - dremel with a cutting disc\nHow you do it\nIn the process of building the 'modular Pinball', I realized that I needed an easy way to propel the fairly heavy ball (metal, 27mm, 80g) into the playfield.\nI could have used some complicated mechanism, involving servos and gears...Instead I decided to make the plunger similar to the ones used in early pinball machines, including just a metal rod, a spring and some sort of retainer for the spring. So I got to work with the metal lathe and started shaving of some material. I ended up with the rod having a diameter of 8.3mm about 10cm into the material and drilled a 3mm hole to screw in a m3 screw with a large washer.(to retain the spring you need a washer larger in diameter than the spring). Unfortunatly the metal lathe had to be removed from the workshop before I had the chance to cut in the m3 thread, so I tried to cut the thread with a bolt and some WD40 - and it worked! (a lot of screws lost their life in this process) Then I designed a mount for the rod and spring in openScad. For me it was important to accomodate for the 10\u00b0 of gradient in the playfield, so the surface where the spring would be pressed against to, had to be at an angle as well. Due to some angles in my design, I could'n print the mount in one piece, so i had split it in two. (Printed on a Dremel without supportmaterial) You can find the file below.\nReduce the diameter of the aluminum rod\nBefore you start using the lathe please note: No rings, no gloves, no wide t-shirts and always always wear protective glasses!\nIf you secured the workpiece into the lathe you can start to shave of material. To accomodate the spring I chose, I had to reduce the diameter from 12 mm to 8.3 mm about 10cm into the rod. To get a better surface you should do the 'cut' in one go, without removing the cutting tool. Unlike I did. If you want an even better and smoother surface, you can grab a piece of sandpaper and sand the workpiece with the lathe running. But be careful.\nDrill and thread a hole\nTo drill a hole into the rod, it is best to do it on the lathe. Assuming you already have the rod in the headstock, you are now going to put a 3mm drill bit into the tailstock. Then you bring the tailstock to the already turning rod and drill the hole. While you are at it you should cut the M3 thread into the hole with the thread cutter. I had to discover that the lathe I was using had to be moved out of the shop. Now you can put a large washer over the screw, insert the rod into the mount(Shoot Kopie.svg)and secure the spring for good.\nAlthough it did work to cut the thread by screwing a couple of screws in and out until they were destroyed, I would't recommend it.\nAttach assembly to the pinball\nNow it's just a matter of attaching your PlungR to the front wall of the pinball. For that you need to drill 5 holes, four 3mm holes to attach the assembly and one 3cm hole to make room for the overhang of the mount.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ2/9R9N/IRAW09AH/FJ29R9NIRAW09AH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRV/POSM/IQYSZBLW/FRVPOSMIQYSZBLW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4I/NM1A/IRAW08Q1/F4INM1AIRAW08Q1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX1/OKGM/IRAW08RD/FX1OKGMIRAW08RD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZO/EVP9/IRAW08RG/FZOEVP9IRAW08RG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKR/KEOY/IRAW08QA/FKRKEOYIRAW08QA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLD/JIC3/IRAW08PQ/FLDJIC3IRAW08PQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA5/EN5B/IRAW08TE/FA5EN5BIRAW08TE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRZ/QEVH/IRAW09A9/FRZQEVHIRAW09A9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Build a PlungR"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "What you need\nFor one FlippR you need:\n5mm MDF\nA flipper assembly\nHow you do it\nTo ensure that the ball would be shot with enoug power, we opted for real flipper assemblies.

So, with the Quidditch World Cup happening this weekend in Frankfurt Germany (check it out, here's the Live Stream for the Quidditch World Cup 2016), I decided to build my kids (and I) a proper set of Quidditch goals for our evening matches.\nI hope you enjoy the build!\n***In case you missed it, they still have the matches from this weekend streaming.

The blonde in the Hufflepuff shirt is my daughter and regular teammate)\nReal-life Quidditch was created on a sunny Sunday afternoon in 2005 by Xander Manshel and Alex Benepe, students at Middlebury College in Vermont, US. Their idle Sunday pastime laid the foundations for the full contact and gender inclusive sport played today. They began playing regular intramural games, and in 2007 played the first intercollegiate match.\nAbout the USQ:\nUS Quidditch is the national governing body for the sport of quidditch. USQ advances the sport by organizing events and programs that build community and empower all genders to compete together.\nInspired by the Harry Potter novels and founded in 2010, we serve over 4,000 athletes on almost 200 teams nationwide and provide a range of services, from hosting nine major tournaments and supervising regular season competition, to training and certifying referees, snitches, and tournament directors, offering grants, running the bi-annual QuidCon leadership conference, and working to expand the sport into younger age groups through outreach programs at the elementary, middle, and high school levels. US Quidditch is a 501(c)3 nonprofit. Membership in USQ is open to teams and individuals in any age group in the United States.\nCORE VALUES\nWe establish the foundation for long-term sustainability through regulations, innovation, and expansion.We provide competitive opportunities for every level of athlete.We build a safe, inclusive, and respectful community.We strive to be a leader in gender inclusivity for all age groups, we create meaningful community partnerships and we develop and empower future leaders.\nVISION STATEMENT\nWe envision a future where every person in the United States is aware of Quidditch as a sport and has opportunities to play and engage at all levels.\nKidditch!!!!!\nIt\u2019s very important for kids to be active and for adults to support this activity. Regular physical activity helps to improve strength and endurance, reduce stress and anxiety, boost self-esteem, build muscles and healthy bones, control weight, and improve overall health. If children can pick up healthy habits now, they can carry the habits with them into a healthy adult life.\nIn recent years, the Quidditch community has started including little kids more and more in the sport. Teams have reached kids with summer camps, Kidditch workshops, and after-school programs. Other teams have been invited to birthday parties to teach Quidditch. Organizations such as Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and Boys and Girls Clubs have paired up with teams to introduce the youth to Quidditch. More specific information on starting a team or establishing youth Quidditch programs can be found here.\n*** Also check out the IQAs web site for more info on the International Quidditch Association.

It's not rocket science. Yet the resulting effect on the body and mind is nothing short of a profound treasure trove of inner wealth. No kidding.\n\nBalance boards are used extensively for training for many sports including surfing, snowboarding, skateboarding, skiing, and any sport that requires a dynamic balance, and are sold commercially under various names and designs.\nIn its most basic form, a Balance Board is a plank of wood sitting atop a roller, and the user stands on the plank of wood and maintains their balance.

That's it.\nAt first it can seem exceptionally difficult to do this, because the balance that is required can seem almost counterintuitive. But it is in fact, highly intuitive- that's why it can seem so foreign in the beginning.\nHowever, the learning curve is very steep- steep in favor of learning it quickly.\nProgress can come very fast for someone who sticks with it, practicing again and again, little by little.\nNot only is it good for developing core body strength, but it also develops a more deeply intuitive sense of balance and spacial awareness.\n\nThe INNER BALANCE BOARD\n\nSo, why exactly is it a treasure trove of wealth??\nBecause when we use a balance board the dynamic that takes place in the mind-body complex is, simply put, one of simultaneous relaxation and concentration. This can be viewed from any number of perspectives: scientific, psychological, even spiritual. But one way to view it, that perhaps bridges all of these perspectives, is that it brings us closer, even if just a little bit, to our own natural state of being.\nAnd is that not the \"thing\" we're all looking for? (even if we're not aware of it and are instead looking to material wealth, relationships, achievement, power, or whatever to feel fulfilled...)\nThis is the same reason yoga and meditation has become so popular, because people are seeking inner balance. And this is why surfing and other similar sports, aside from the hype, are so addictive; because we are plunged into an experience of being only in the present moment in complete balance... and there is nothing else like it.\nHow is it something so simple (there's that word again) can be so easily overlooked in favor of a material or ego-based gratification?\nPerhaps because it's so near to us.. like looking everywhere for our own eyelashes- and yet we cannot see them because they are so close to us..", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FK9/Z311/IQYSZOS8/FK9Z311IQYSZOS8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKM/A08S/IQYSZO93/FKMA08SIQYSZO93.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKN/MDPE/IQYSZO9N/FKNMDPEIQYSZO9N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEH/WD8S/IQYSZOA0/FEHWD8SIQYSZOA0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: How It Works"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "A balance board can be made from many different materials in many different designs.\nThe one here was made from scrap lumber and other junk materials that for some would otherwise end up in a trash bin..\nHere's some of the materials and tools that were used here:\n\n\u2022 a piece of sturdy plywood or boards for the deck\n\u2022 Smaller pieces/ strips of wood\n\u2022 Something to serve as a rolling fulcrum (pivot point) -in this case I used a scrap piece of large diameter (11cm) PVC pipe.\n\u2022 wood screws\n\n\u2022 a saw for cutting the wood and PVC pipe\n\u2022 A drill/ Screwgun\n\u2022 thin drill bit to make pilot holes\n\u2022 screwdriver bit for the screws.\n\u2022 (optional) wood files/ shapers to make custom shapes\n\nIn every case when fastening parts together, I first drilled pilot holes to prevent splitting and cracking, and countersunk the screws so they are below the surface of the wood or other material they are fastened to.\n\nThe balance board has two basic parts: the deck and a rolling fulcrum.\n\nTHE DECK\n\nThe easiest would be to use a single piece of wood, such as plywood, as a deck.\nI've also heard of people using old skateboard decks with the trucks removed.\nI had some scraps of 3x12.5cm hardwood lumber, so I decided to use two pieces to make a single deck.\n\nAlthough a board by itself, paired with a roller would itself work, it's good to have stoppers for the roller so the board (and your body) doesn't fly off the roller when it reaches the end of the deck.\n\nI used some scrap pieces of 3x3cm board as \"roller stoppers\", and these also served to keep the two deck boards secured together.\nAlso I used some thin pieces of plywood scraps running the length of the deck to make a track for the roller to stay within.\nAnother way to do it is to use a roller that is considerably longer than the width of the deck, allowing the deck to 'float' from side to side as it travels over the roller.\n\nAlso it can be seen that I have two pieces of wood at each end of the top side of the deck. These were originally the bottom of the deck, but I decided to move the roller stoppers in closer to the middle, away from the ends of the deck, which allows for more leverage to balance the board when the deck reaches the end of its travel limit. The wood pieces on the top side of the board now serve as foot 'cants'. A cant elevates the outside of the foot, making it higher than the instep to allow the knees a more natural alignment with the feet, and allowing for a lower center of gravity in the body which assists in balance.\n\nTHE ROLLER\n\nThe roller can be anything that allows the board to roll smoothly over it and provides enough height for the board to be high enough off the ground.\nI used a scrap piece of 11cm PVC pipe, but other objects will work too; a dense foam yoga-type roller, I've even heard of people using a two or three liter plastic bottles filled with water.\n\nFabricating the roller was the most challenging part.\nThe PVC I used is the thin-walled type, so over time the roller cracked under the weight of the deck (I would use the thick walled type next time).\nThe idea for a low cost scrap material solution was to cut out disks of plywood in the same size as the opening of the PVC and fasten them in the ends of the pipe to make it more rigid. Cutting a perfectly round disk was not as easy as I thought!... And getting it to stay put took some time too.\nIn the end, when epoxy didn't work, I used screws to fasten them, and to date they're still holding up.\n\nAfter assembling the roller, I wrapped it in a layer of duct tape to keep it from being too slippery and sliding out from under the board.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6S/4504/IQYSZO1D/F6S4504IQYSZO1D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAE/LJRC/IQYSZO1G/FAELJRCIQYSZO1G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1H/WKDT/IQYSZO2A/F1HWKDTIQYSZO2A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIN/VPY7/IQYSZON4/FINVPY7IQYSZON4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2P/UU2T/IQYSZONN/F2PUU2TIQYSZONN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: How It's Made"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Now that the board is functional, it's time to use it!\n\nIf it's your first time, it's worth mentioning a word on safety. It can be tricky at first so use common sense and be careful.\nHere's some tips on using the board:\n\n\u2022 give yourself plenty of space to use it\n\u2022 having a chair in front of you to assist with balance can be helpful in the beginning. It can also help to have a friend spot you.\n\u2022 a smooth surfaced floor will be faster than a carpeted floor. Try at first on a slower surface, such as low carpet, then as you get a feel for it or want to challenge yourself, use a smooth floor.\n\u2022 stepping onto the board and getting started can actually be one of the most difficult parts! So I've included a numbered picture to help with this.\n\n1) with the roller in the middle of the deck and with your weight centered, gently step on the board.\n2) with your weight mostly on the lower foot, place the other foot to an upper position, wider than your shoulders (but not too wide).\n3) with knees slightly bent, slowly shift your body weight toward the upper foot.\n4) slowly increase the amount of weight/pressure you are putting on the upper foot until\n5) the board lifts off the ground. Be prepared for the board to move! And\n6) respond as needed to keep the board balanced on the roller.\n\n\u2022 it is much easier to keep the board moving than to try to balance completely still.\n\u2022 there can be a tendency to look down at the board. It can also be helpful to raise the head and look around you.\n\u2022 practicing little by little seems to develop fast muscle memory. Do short practice sessions and take breaks before doing it again.\n\u2022 once you get the basic sense of it, there's many ways you can challenge yourself and increase skill level.

We would be humble to say he only invented water.\"\nI stumbled upon a post from ThinkGeek last June stating that they were looking for volunteers to make Timmy some new costumes, and being someone who loves to make costumes and is huge fan of ThinkGeek, I was instantly excited! I volunteered and crossed my fingers that I would be able to be a part of it....! Shortly afterwards I received an email confirming that I would be making a Bowser costume and even received my very own Timmy in the mail!\nI had such a great time making his costume last year, that this year I was on the lookout for the opportunity again! I came across this post here, and signed up with a suggestion of my own...Hellboy! I love the Hellboy series and thought it would be such a fun costume to create...and it was!\nI hope you enjoy this tutorial as much as I enjoyed creating this project, and if this is something you are interested in being a part of yourself, definitely be on the look out next year!

Since this monkey is roughly 6\" tall I wanted to make sure I would be able to fit in as many details as possible but also simplify anything that looked too tiny to re-create.\nOriginally I had wanted to make detachable horns (as you can see in the photo) but I scrapped my plans for using velcro so I could add detail the surface of the short horns.

Once I had all the pieces traced, I double checked that the connecting seams matched to ensure everything would sew together correctly.\nI cut out all of the pieces for the body using a polyester red knit fabric. As an extra detail I thought it would be fun to give the Hellboy plush some abs ; ) I used 1/4\" craft foam as a base underneath the front chest piece and stitched on an ab design. (This turned out to be one of my favorite parts!)\nHaving some experiences making plush toys I knew I would have to sew some of the pieces together by hand as they are too tiny to manage in a sewing machine, however (my personal opinion) the seams look much better when you use a sewing machine so I tried to use mine as much as possible. The trickiest areas were the openings of the hands and the feet as well as the edge of the face which did require some hand sewing.\nI used the Poly-fil to lightly stuff the tail before securing it on the center back seam. Other than the tail, everything remained un-stuffed while the body was being sewn together.\nFor the face I used 9mm black toy eyes (which for some reason I actually already had!) These are really easy to use, you just poke a small hole in your fabric where you want the eyes to go then slide the eye through, securing it in place with the plastic backing.\nThe nose was created using black embroidery thread and an embroidery needle.\nI continued sewing all of the body pieces together and left a small 2\" hole opening on the bottom so I could insert the stuffing. I lightly stuffed the entire monkey and hand sewed the bottom opening closed using red thread.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FS2/0TOV/IQTZXTIP/FS20TOVIQTZXTIP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO0/AEQL/IQTZXTR8/FO0AEQLIQTZXTR8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ1/0JJ1/IQTZXTX2/FZ10JJ1IQTZXTX2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6T/42ZL/IQTZXTYA/F6T42ZLIQTZXTYA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2O/U6QA/IQTZXU31/F2OU6QAIQTZXU31.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF6/ZRVA/IQTZXU8Z/FF6ZRVAIQTZXU8Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2W/EU7D/IQTZXUFB/F2WEU7DIQTZXUFB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Sewing the Monkey Plush"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Supplies Needed:\nTools:\nScissors\nAwl\nHot Glue Gun\nNeedle\nLighter\nMaterials:\nRed Craft Foam\nBlack Faux Fur Fabric\nBlack Faux Leather Fabric\nGlue Sticks\nBlack Thread\nTo create the hair I used black faux fur. This worked really well to get the look right and was also very easy to work with.\nThe entire hair piece slid over the head (almost like a wig) which allowed me to adjust the shape as I worked with it.\nI rolled a small tube of the faux fur fabric to create the ponytail and used black faux leather to create the band in his hair. This was hand stitched in place using black thread, and once in place it was tacked down in a few key areas.\nI actually ended up waiting until the very end to sew the hair all the way in place, I was slightly intimidated to tackle this part, not wanting to ruin his face! I used black thread to hand stitch the edges of the hair to the face and the faux fur ended up hiding all the stitching really well. (Phew!) And since the fabric was knit, it formed nicely around the entire head.\nThe horns were created using red craft foam. I used hot glue to layer three pieces together to get the right thickness. I wasn't sure how the hot glue would stick but it held very strongly to the foam which was a nice surprise!\nI also wanted to give the horns some texture so I used an x-acto knife to etch in the details. To deepen the etched areas I used a lighter to heat up the tip of an awl which I used to melt down the foam.

I sewed all the seams using a 1/4\" seam allowance to reduce bulk and folded over/ topstiched all of the hems to give everything a clean finish.\nI used faux brown leather for the collar and sleeve details. Iron on transfers were used to create the patches on the sleeves. And I also added padded faux leather \"leg warmers\" to give the pants more details.\nThe belt was a fun piece to put together. I used faux brown leather for all of the straps and added tiny metal studs to make it look more realistic. I was also able to add a belt buckle by using iron on transfer paper and incorporated some chain & beads to create the rosary necklace.\nAs an extra detail I added one of my labels so the ThinkGeek crew would remember me! ; )", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCL/4CPW/IQV7LHQK/FCL4CPWIQV7LHQK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDU/8SBB/IQV7LHRO/FDU8SBBIQV7LHRO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FII/63LN/IQV7LHSC/FII63LNIQV7LHSC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2E/G0S4/IQV7LHUG/F2EG0S4IQV7LHUG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMK/OMXF/IQV7LHUL/FMKOMXFIQV7LHUL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY2/L8LZ/IQV7LHYM/FY2L8LZIQV7LHYM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV2/31XK/IQV7LHZX/FV231XKIQV7LHZX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTE/YZPK/IQV7LI04/FTEYZPKIQV7LI04.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKR/T5WE/IQV7LI16/FKRT5WEIQV7LI16.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ9/KJRD/IQV7LI1X/FZ9KJRDIQV7LI1X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMD/DJQ9/IQV7LI3N/FMDDJQ9IQV7LI3N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F54/XJP2/IQV7LI5T/F54XJP2IQV7LI5T.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Creating the Hellboy Costume"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Supplies Needed:\nTools:\nScissors\nX-acto Knife\nAwl\nLighter\nHot Glue Gun\nRed Acrylic Craft Paint\nMaterials:\nRed Craft Foam\nGlue Sticks\nPaint Brush\nPaper\nThe right hand of doom...one of the most important parts!

I've spent the past few days wandering around and trying to learn everything I can about the game. I've also read waaaay too much about it. :D\nPokemon Go is VERY different from previous Pokemon games. There are no more fights with Pokemon to capture them - you just throw Poke Balls at them! The only time you fight is at gyms, but these fights are not turn based like previous games, and instead use a poke-and-swipe-the-screen fighting style. (And I won't cover gyms here as I have not figured it all out yet.)\nIn this instructable, I wanted to cover the things I've figured out so far in Pokemon Go. I hope you enjoy this beginner's guide to Pokemon Go! Once you've finished reading this, I highly suggest you go check out the Pokemon Go subreddit - loads of great info about the game and the current bugs it has!\nP.S. Found out something neat about the game? Share it in the comments :D\nP.P.S. The game is VERY buggy so far. Servers are always down, the app freezes and lags, features don't work, and sometimes it's pretty much impossible to throw the Poke Ball correctly no matter what you do. So keep that in mind.

If your screen is off, or the app is running in the background, the game is not registering any activity. You must have the app open and the screen on to ensure the game is tracking your movements and location.\nWhat Do I Do if My Phone's Battery Dies Super Fast?\nIf you go to the \"settings\" menu you can enable \"Battery Saver\" mode that allows the screen to go black with a dim \"Pokemon Go\" logo on it when you're not actively looking at it. I suggest enabling this - it's helped increase my battery life!\nAlso, turn off wi-fi if you're away from your home signal. If you have wi-fi on walking around, your phone will constantly be searching available wi-fi networks and using power that way. (I'm curious to see how much data this game uses in the long run, too - unsure about that right now)\nTurn Vibration On\nThis makes it so much easier to know when a Pokemon is nearby! The alert sounds in the game are often drowned out by the music, or hard to make out.\nI've turned my sound and music off and turned on vibration - this way I can walk and listen to music but still get alerts.\nWhat to Do if Your Phone Freezes and Lags\nMy phone and my partner's phone have serious issues with lagging. This mostly happens when fighting Pokemon with the camera enabled to show a real-time photo of the scene in front of you as the background. You can disable the photo view when in a fight with a Pokemon - there's a toggle in the upper right hand corner to turn it off.\nMuch faster, and I like the animated backgrounds better anyway. :D", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQV/Q6KF/IRXT3BHZ/FQVQ6KFIRXT3BHZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: General Tips for Playing the Game"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Rotate your map around and look for tiny green leaves floating up from the ground.

Make sure to keep the hand holding the phone completely still - moving that hand can cause the ball to veer right or left even if you aimed well with the flicking hand. :P\nI like to \"arch\" the ball by flicking up at various speeds - it seems to work best.

These candies allow you to evolve and power up the Pokemon. You will also receive Stardust, which is used for powering up Pokemon.\nRUN AWAY (sometimes)\nNote that you shouldn't catch EVERY Pokemon you run across, even though I know that's what the theme song says.\nI frequently run from battles with common Pokemon that are weaker than the ones in my box. If I don't need their candies and they aren't strong, I just run to save a Poke Ball.

Technically you can evolve and power up a Pokemon whenever you want, but the way I describe below is more cost effective since it takes so long to get the candies you need.\nTo evolve a Pokemon, you use candies! Basically, you need to catch a ton of the Pokemon you want to evolve to get that type of candy, and transfer any low powered Pokemon of that type to Professor Willow for even more candy.\nYou will need between 12-100 candies (well, that I've seen so far) to evolve a Pokemon - it all depends on the Pokemon type and how evolved it is already. For example, a Pokemon that's already been evolved once or twice may require 100 candies the second time you evolve it.\nDon't evolve your Pokemon right away. You want to evolve Pokemon that already have really high CP points. In most cases, you only want to evolve Pokemon with 200+ CP points. Essentially, the higher the CP points the better.\nOtherwise, you'll be evolving a low-powered Pokemon and will get a weak Pokemon in return once it's evolved!\nI evolved a couple Pokemon (Pidgey and Rattata) too soon so their evolved forms were really low powered - both under 200 CP. I actually caught the evolved versions later on when I was a higher level and they were so much stronger! And then I felt stupid for wasting so much candy on weak Pokemon.

I will also go over that below.\nFor each type of template (development cards, item cards, etc) there will be a file with \"_back\" at the end of the fie name. This is the back side that will need to be printed on the reverse side for each of the template types.\nFor example:development_cards_A.jpg will be printed, flipped over, and fed back into the printer. Then development_cards_back.jpg will be printed on the reverse side. You will need to do this with everything you print.\nThere are two instances where you will find a file labeled \"_back_2\" at the end, such as development_cards_back_2.jpg. These files are only used with two specific template files (explained in the detailed instructions further down) in order to save ink. If you don't care about the amount of ink you use, ignore the \"_back_2\" files.\nIf you are going to follow Step 3 (optional):\nIn step three, you will be gluing the tiles you printed onto cardboard to make them thicker.

Those are your guides for cutting them out. I highly recommend that you use an x-acto knife, ruler, and cutting mat to cut these out. You will end up with perfectly straight cuts and the cards and tiles will look very nice. However, if you decide to use scissors, you will want to crease or fold the paper where the cut guides line up, then use your scissors to cut along your creases.\nIf you decide to use a ruler and x-acto knife, make sure you have a cutting mat or something you don't mind getting scratched up under the templates as you cut.\nYou will want to line up the ruler with the cut guides. Once you have it in place, push down on it firmly with one hand so the paper doesn't move around underneath, and use your other hand to cut along the edge of the ruler with your x-acto knife, much like you would if you were drawing a line with a pencil and ruler. Refer to the images above.\nFor all the templates except for the tiles, you'll need to make your cuts not quite edge to edge so that you don't cut it all the way across and not be able to use the lines on the border as guides any more.\nFor the development cards, resource cards, and item cards, you will cut the middle cards out first. I found this to be the easiest way to do it.\nFor the tiles, line the ruler up with the edges with the planet-side up, and make your cuts. This is because the tile backs are slightly larger than the fronts, so that if they don't quite line up when you print them, there won't be any white space around them.\nBut, if you're following Step 3 (Optional)...\nYou will need to cut out the fronts of the tiles, then use one of them as a guide to get the backs the same size (since they're a bit larger).

I personally designed the center portion of my game board first (as pictured). The most important features of the main space on the board are the title and your community chest and chance card holder spaces.\nAs you can see, I have renamed the game Pottopoly (I manipulated the Harry Potter logo on Photoshop) and the action card spaces Potions and Charms. Whatever you decide on calling these cards in this step, you will have to stick with it because you will later use the same name on the action spaces on the board as well as the cards themselves.\nI recommend creating your graphics on a canvas that is twice the size of what you actually need it to be, so when you scale your image to size, the quality will remain. Note: The more complex you create your game board, the more difficult the label application process will be.\nYou can download the Lumos and Harry Potter fonts online, which I used on all aspects of the game (except for the logo). For instructions on how to install this font into Windows 10, click here.\nIMPORTANT: The more complex your center design is, the more important it will become in the next stages that you lay down the images perfectly.

In Paint (or Photoshop if you wish), access the print page setup menu.\nOnce you are in the Print Page set up, set your page orientation to portrait.\nNow, make sure that your printer is set to the following margins:\n.75\" on the left and right margins\n.5\" on the top and bottom margins\nThese margins will print you an image on four sheets of paper. You will notice that more of the image is printed on two sheets (two sheets will measure 7\" wide x 10\" long and the other two will measure 7\" wide x 4\" long).\nPrint the image.\nCut these printed images out with your precision cutter and lay them on your board to make sure the sizing looks good for your board. The goal is to have the image centered while also leaving enough room for your play squares (I'll refer to them as pathways from here on).\nHaving on old Monopoly board makes this step particularly easy because your measurements are already done for you. If they are not already done for you, see the next step for measurement guidance.\nIf your image is too large, you can play with the margins provided above to get it to a size that works for your game board.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F01/1OW8/IQ6UN96E/F011OW8IQ6UN96E.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Print and Test Your Center Design"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Once you are happy with the test copies of your center image, it is time to print the final copies onto your adhesive labels. When cutting your labels, it is especially important that you leave white \"tabs\" (pictured) on the sides of your images. Here's how to strategize where to place your tabs.\nDecide which label you would like to lay down first, and then leave two white tabs (about .5\") on the sides where the other corners of the image will be laid down.\nI decided to lay down my bottom left image first, and so I left a tab on the top and right of my image.\nDecide which label you will lay second, and then leave one white tab in the direction of where your third label will be.\nMy bottom right label was second, and so I left a tab on top because my third image would be my top right corner.\nYour third label will require a tab in the direction of your final corner.\nYour fourth label will require no tabs whatsoever.\n\nMeasurement\n(You may skip this step if you are using an old game board)\nDepending on the size of your board, you may want to adjust your outer pathways so that you have enough space for multiple players to land on at once.\nThe measurements of the play spaces on a typical Monopoly board are 2.75\" tall (we'll worry about width when it comes time to design your pathways), but you might want to make them smaller or larger depending on how big your own board is. If your center image has printed to be 14\" x 14\", this measurement will be perfect for the pathways.\nUsing a ruler or tape measure, draw straight lines that are 2.75\" away (or your selected measurement) from each edge of the board. You will use these lines as guides when placing your labels, so be sure they are parallel to the edges and perfectly straight.\n\nPlacement\nThe Avery shipping labels are especially good for this task because their backing lifts off in small sections at a time. This gives you the freedom to hold your image carefully without your hand sticking too much to the label. This step will require a good deal of light, a flat surface, and some patience.\nKeep in mind that wherever your first corner is laid down determines the entire positioning. Depending on the surface of your board, you may only get one shot to place these labels down. With that said, here are some things to remember:\nIt is more important that the center images are laid as perfectly as possible. It's far easier to hide imperfect outer edges of the center than it is to hide imperfections in the center of the image.\nRemember to lay down your labels in the order that you determined.\nKeep your hands as dry as possible so that the ink doesn't smudge and you don't transfer it from one part of the image to another.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJV/R8YK/IQ8SCEO6/FJVR8YKIQ8SCEO6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Applying the Center Image to the Game Board"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "It's time to design your pathways (playing squares)!\nMeasure the exposed surface area of your game board. This space will be used for the game play spaces. Next, create a template either by hand or on your computer.\nNote: If designing by computer, I recommend creating a template that is double the size to ensure quality images. If your image went down crooked, you might need to increase the size of your borders to cover these imperfections.\nCreate a template (or use the one provided) that is twice the size you need it.\nThe provided template above is intended for a Monopoly board (19.25\" x 19.25\"). Because of quality, however, it is double the size needed (38.5\"x5.75\"). I have also made this template 1/8\" larger than necessary to help you accommodate your errors.\nPlan ahead! Take a look at a Monopoly board (or the board shown above) to see what kinds of spaces you need to fill. Some examples include:\nProperty Spaces\nTaxes\nChance Spaces (I've renamed them Potions)\nCommunity Chest Spaces (Charms)\nTransportation Spaces\nCorner Spaces (Go, Jail, Free Parking, and Go to Jail)\nYou must also keep in mind that Monopoly groups properties together in groups of 3 (except for the dark blue/Park Place & Boardwalk segment, which is only 2). You will need to color code these on your board as well as on your property deeds later on.\nFor my own board, I made each color group a different theme. For example, my dark purple spaces are places of residence before Harry goes to Hogwarts (Hut on the Rock and the Cupboard under the Stairs). The red block includes locations around the castle (Quidditch Field, Gryffindor Tower, and Hagrid's Hut). The color coding is necessary, but themed color blocks are not.\nOnce you have decided what to fill your board with, complete the blank template for all four sides of your board. Here are important things to keep in mind:\nThis template spans 11 spaces (the 9 middle spaces and 2 corners). So when designing your first side (let's say from Go to Jail), you can design these two corners. However, when you go to design the next side, remember to keep the right corner blank because you've already designed it (Jail space), and so on.\nYou will need to clearly label each property with its name, the price of purchase, and its \"color group.\"\nAs you can see with my own project, I have kept the color groups the same as well as the fees (with the important exception of changing dollars to galleons!).\nGo on Google for all of the images you need. There's quite the collection there for you to use!\nDo NOT alter the template provided. Even though you will not need to design every corner cell, messing with the sizing of the template provided will make your printing and sizing step much more difficult.\nOnce you are happy with your design, move onto the next step.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FR7/AEVE/IQ8SCI19/FR7AEVEIQ8SCI19.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Designing Your Play Spaces"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Time to prepare your pathways. First, you will need to test print and cut them to make sure that they both fit the game board and cover any imperfections that emerged during the center square placement.\nIf you are printing pathways to fit a board that is 19.25\"x19.25\" (Monopoly size), these are the printing margins that you will need to use (whether you print my pre-designed spaces or if you use the blank template I provided).\n.25\" left and right margins.\n.5\" top and bottom margins.\n\nCutting Your Pathways\nCut your pathways with your die cutter or precision cutter, remembering to leave overlap tabs just as we did with your center image). You'll want to plan the placement of these tabs strategically, though! Typically, each segment of pathway should have at least one tab (except for the final portion of pathway that will be laid).\nIf you wish to mimic what I have done above, here was the plan of attack I used:\nLay down the left side first (top piece, then bottom piece)\nLay down the top side next (right piece, then left piece)\nLay down the right side after (bottom piece, then top piece)\nLay down the bottom side last (left piece, then right piece)\nRemember that this part of your game board creation is particularly difficult because you will need to make sure that the pathways line up both with each other and their tangent pathways that come in on a right angle.\nApply Your Pathway Labels\nThis session of adhesion is perhaps the most difficult because it will determine the overall look and feel of your board. You will definitely want to use the edge of your game board to help you place these labels neatly (although if you have cut the board yourself, you might want to exercise a bit of caution. If your board has been cut crookedly, your pathways will appear crooked and overlap each other incorrectly on the board).\nTips for Adhesion: Make use of the conveniently-backed Avery adhesive labels. Take off each section in portions to ensure maximum control over how the labels are adhered.After placing your labels, run your hand over the corners and edges to make sure that the labels are firmly attached. (Beware of sweaty hands during this step, especially if your ink is fresh!)If you have a folding board, fold your board now gently to make sure that your graphics remain in place.If your corners lift, you might want to consider adding a dab of fabric glue (which dries clear) under the edge to further fasten the images to the board. If you find a piece that has not been covered by graphics, such as the remainder of a white label tab, you can simply color in the imperfections with sharpies and/or markers.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FEN/UCYV/IQ6UNZO8/FENUCYVIQ6UNZO8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO1/RXVF/IQ6UO91C/FO1RXVFIQ6UO91C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8F/FTOM/IQ8SCIU5/F8FFTOMIQ8SCIU5.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Prepare and Apply Your Pathways to the Board"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "NOTE: I've just been notified that the links to all of my files do not work for some reason.

I have provided blank templates that are approximately the size of traditional Monopoly deeds for you to create your won.\nEach double-sided property card is composed of 3 aspects:\nThe title of the property on the correctly colored label (front)\nRent, cottage, and castle information (front)\nAnd mortgage information (see the mortgage information step for important details) (front and back)\nI have copied the purchase/rent/mortgage amounts found on the regular Monopoly, but if you have changed these values on your actual game spaces, you will need to invent these values.

You probably also noticed (when scrolling through the pre-made template) that the order of the deeds is reversed. This is intentional! When printing double-sided images, we have to account for how the printer flips the image. Detailed printing instructions can be found in the next step.\nSo, you must design your deeds with this in mind. If you are creating a Hut on the Rock deed in the top left cell of the front side template, you must place the mortgage information/reverse side for Hut on the Rock on the top right cell of the back side template. Or, if you're placing property information for The Leaky Cauldron on the bottom right of the front side, you must place its mortgage info on the bottom left of the back side. But if you are working on a deed that is in the top center cell, you can place the mortgage information in the top center of the reverse side template.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIZ/JMXD/IQ9PLRML/FIZJMXDIQ9PLRML.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Design Your Property Deeds"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "As always, you will want to print your deeds on regular paper to proofread and ensure that they are aligned correctly, both in terms of text on the cell and the alignment of the front and reverse sides.\nFirst, you will need to tell your printer to print double-sided and flip on short edge. Be sure that your document is also in landscape printing orientation. (This step is pictured and annotated above)\nOnce your deeds are printed, cut them out with your precision trimmer as if you were ready to play with them and thoroughly inspect them again. The black surrounding square encompassing all 6 deeds is a cutting guideline only. Try to cut just inside of this line.\nHere are some important things to check for:\nHas the correct mortgage information (reverse side) been printed on the back of each card?\nIs the mortgage information on the reverse side centered on the card?\nHow does the spacing of the text and images look?\nIs there enough contrast between the text and the colored property square? You might want to have some titles appear in white to enhance readability.\n\nPrinting the Final Copy of Your Deeds\nOnce you have made the proper adjustments to your cards and are happy with their appearance, it's time to print them for real onto white 8.5\" x 11\" card stock. The kind I have is a 65 lb. weight paper, which is durable enough for our purposes.\nLet the ink dry on your cards for about 6 hours.\nWhen cutting your deeds, be sure to:\nCut with the front of the deeds facing upward, so you can see what you're doing.\nCut inside of the major square containing all of the deeds (you don't want this black line to be visible on the edge of any of your deeds)\nCut each card directly in the center of the blank spaces between each cell.

Then you need to attach that drive shaft to the stepper motor in one of two ways:\nThread two nuts onto the bottom of the drive such that they lock. The best way to do this is to use a counter rotating nut but you can do it with force as well. Maybe with a dab of epoxy. Then cut a piece of shrink wrap that will fit over the nuts and your drive on the stepper motor. Note that most stepper motors in the form factor we need have a gear attached. Finally, shrink the heat wrap. Now pull the shaft off the gear. The final tightening with the cable tie will come later.\nUse the 3D Printed mount that I designed. Insert two M2 nuts into the mount and then screw in two M2 bolts and slide over servo gear and tighten the appropriate bolt.\nOnce the above is done get the pusher bar and insert an M4 nut into the space provided. Insert the pusher bars through the bottom of the base with the bolt holder oriented down. You should have done a dry fit of this to ensure that everything is smooth. If not, do so, and if not smooth, make it so!\nNow the fiddly bit. With the pusher assembly as far up as it can go insert the drive shaft and turn it until the nut engages and the shaft has moved enough that you can slide it into the coupler for option 2, or over the gear for option 1, from above.\nIf you are doing option 1 you can now use the cable tie on the part of the shrink wrap over the gear to secure the drive shaft to the stepper motor gear. If you are doing option 2 then tighten the two set screws.\nAt some point the ends of the push bars should be glued into the holes provided for them on the cars.\nFinally, attach the open end stop as shown in the picture.

While the Zeta does retain a good portion of its predecessor's features, it also integrates new building techniques that enable easier construction and better performance.\nDevelopment\nDevelopment of the Zeta began after I revisited the Advanced Omniwing in November 2015. As it had been some time since I'd last made an Advanced Omniwing, I had forgotten just how much imprecision there was in the design during construction. Knowing that approximation can sometimes lead to problems if certain things are not estimated correctly, I decided to redesign the aircraft to standardize construction. In addition, because of previous experiences with the Advanced Omniwings, I decided I would also integrate vertical stabilizers into the design to improve stability. As I had previously found that six vertical stabilizers provided sufficient yaw stability on unmodified Advanced Omniwings, I believed that this number would be sufficient for the Zeta as well. With these two construction goals in mind, I began prototype work on \"the Zeta project.\"\nThe first Zeta prototype (\"YF3-6A\") was made by myself over several hours' time with design decisions made as production progressed. Its general layout was very much like that of an unmodified Advanced Omniwing but its internal structural design became substantially different. Unlike the standard Advanced Omniwing, the Zeta's longerons and spars are one modular assembly composed of several standardized parts, secured into the airframe at key points. This design change offered the advantage of enabling easier construction by allowing individual parts for these structures to be made and handled separately for a long period of time before being put together and then fitted to the wings in a larger group. Eventually, I modified the internal structures of the design to give it better strength with only a very meager amount of weight being added. The design with those modifications excelled and was approved for publication as the F3-6C.\nTAA USAF Designation: F3-6C", "title": "How to Make the Omniwing Zeta Paper Airplane", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-the-Omniwing-Zeta-Paper-Airplane/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Required:\n8 Pieces of 8.5 inch by 11 inch Paper\n2 Post-Its (3 inch by 3 inch)\nTape\nScissors\nRuler\nPencil", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Materials"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "With two pieces of 8.5 by 11 inch paper, align both over top of one another flush.

Placing the feeder near water will also help to draw more animals to the feeder. Finally, placing it in or near a bird feeder complex may draw out more animals as well. This is where you'll need some string. Thread the string through the red connector holes, and then tie it to the branch or pole. Make sure to tie a sturdy knot that can support the feeder's weight!\nTo fill the feeder, simply pour some seed into the tray. Some of it might fall out of the sides, but that's OK.

Work colleagues honking and jeering at you when passing you with their Bentleys or even a petty Mercedes Benz?\nWell, there's an end to your suffering!\nPimp up your old bike with a stately mascot. Even better, a wind-wheel, concealed behind a classic chrome grille, drives the mascot, so when riding your bike it will start flapping its wings, turning the faces of all those luxury limo owners green with envy!\nThe Bicycle Mascot works just like a good old toy almost everybody had as a child: the \"jumping jack\" (or \"Hampelmann\" in german). A pullstring is used to lift the wings that will drop back due to their weight once the pullstring is released. To automate this process while riding your bike, I decided to use a wind wheel with a slightly off-center pin to which the pullstring is loosely connected. The relative wind drives the wind wheel (an idea I used before in my bicycle bubble machine) which will make the off-center pin periodically pull the string by approximately 1cm.\nLEGAL NOTE: For the design files to this instructable, I've used the following open and free to use third party works: I generated the woman figure using the character creation tool \u201cManuelbastioniLAB\u201d created by Manuel Bastioni (www.manuelbastioni.com); all output of this software is licensed under creative commons attribution license.

Also, you'll need an allen key.\nCheck your bicycle first\nMy bike's handlebar has a diameter of 25mm on the middle part, where this machine connects. Please measure your handlebar first to see if this thing fits without modifications. If your diameter is a little smaller and you don't feel up to the task of modifying my design, you might want to just use some leather or cloth strips to get enough grip to the handlebar.\nPrinting\nNow, print all the pieces. I tried to give all pieces enough clearance for this to run smoothly, but it will make your life easier if you have a well calibrated, good printer with a sufficient build volume (the grille/hood measures roughly 150x166x159mm -- I have ideas for a simple mount without a grille and with much less footprint, but that's for the future). Also, it's good to use a reliable printer -- thanks for helping finish this project go to my brother and his machine, as my DIY Kossel is so quirky and delicate I wouldn't ever let it run overnight ...\nYou'll need to print the following parts that you will find here.\n1x hood.stl\n1x windwheel.stl\n1x mascotbody.stl\n1x mascotarms.stl (work better right now than mascotwings.stl, into which I have to put more work ...)\n2x mascotclip.stl\n2x mountclip.stl (optional, needs two more screws and nuts)\nSettings: In general, I like to use three shells at least, but very little infill (10%). However, for the mascot and the grille I used 40%: the mascot rests on a very small area and its head has only a small connection to the body; the grille has the mounting clips which have to take some strain.\nFor the wind wheel and the arms, you will have to use support. Be careful during removal, as parts may easily snap. The mascot body may print well on good printers without support, but I'd use it (it's much easier to remove than the support for wind wheel and arms). The rest of the parts don't need support.\nEspecially for the mascot body and the wings, printing with a raft is a good idea. The rest printed well without for me.\nI decided to spray my printed parts silver, mainly because I didn't have any silver filament at hand.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FW4/7PT9/IPWWSMG2/FW47PT9IPWWSMG2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Preparations and Printing"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Assembly of the printed parts should be straight forward.\nThe wind wheel is mounted inside the hood using the 30mm M3 screw and a nut.

Put the the 30mm M3 screw through the hole in the wind wheel, with the head to the side of the pin on the wind wheel. The wheel must run absolutely freely on the M3 screw (it did right away with my brother's printer) -- if not, take a drill to remove any printing debris in there or widen the hole. It may be a good idea to put an M3 washer on the screw, between the wheel and the grille, to reduce friction; many washers have a smooth and a rough side, put the smooth side to the wheel. Now screw all this through the pocketed nut; the wheel should still run freely, if not, try loosening the screw a little again.\nNow connect the mascot to the hood.

On the arms or wings you have a slot where later you will place them on the shoulder shafts of the mascot. And you have a hole where the pullstring should go through. When mounted, the holes in both arms will be adjacent to each other. Place the arms in front of you like on the first photo and pull the yarn through both. Now, take both ends of the yarn and get them through the channel that begins in the chest of the mascot and comes out again of its left leg; with yarn, this is hard, so I knotted the ends to a piece of wire which let me pass them through the cannel easily. Now place the arms on the shoulder shafts; they will fit when done carefully -- don't force this, so you don't snap the head off or break the joints.\nTest the function of the arms: pull on the yarn ends from below. The arms should lift with minimal force and fall down again as soon as you let go of the pullstring. If they don't, take your files and knife and stuff and search the chest of the mascot as well as the joints of the wings for printing inaccuracies, rough parts, filament stringing etc. Don't continue before this motion works smoothly.\nNow, pull the two ends of the yarn through the hole in the bonnet down, to connect it to the rotating pin.\nThe next part can also be a little tricky: basically, you want to make a knot in the yarn ends just below the pin in a position so the arms are lifted as high as is easily possible (not higher!) when the pin is lowest during the wind wheel rotation. For this, I recommend putting the hood in a slightly upright position and fix the wind wheel in its position (with the pin lowest) by sticking pencils through the grille to block the weel (see photo). Now pull the ends of the yarn until the wings reach their high position, without stretching anything, and make a double knot below the pin; it might be a good idea to make a loop in the second knot, so you can loosen it again if you didn't get the tension right -- trust me, this can take some tries!\nAs you can see on the photos, I made another knot slightly above the pin to stop it from getting of the pin, but still loose enough so the yarn isn't wrapped around the pin when the wheel rotates. In the end, I don't think this was necessary.\nWhen done, test: the wind wheel should spin easily, moving the arms as much as possible. If you notice a little resistance in wheel rotation when the pin is lowest, this indicates the yarn is stretched -- this won't work later, it just won't rotate. Do it right now, loosen that knot and try again.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FK8/Q8ZC/IPTJGZHR/FK8Q8ZCIPTJGZHR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F08/9NSI/IPWWSGB7/F089NSIIPWWSGB7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYN/JOAS/IPWWSGBA/FYNJOASIPWWSGBA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYF/T84W/IPWWSGBB/FYFT84WIPWWSGBB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Connect the Pullstring"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "You're nearly done.

If you want it mounted more securely or you don't get the right position right away, you can print 2 mountclip.stl parts: they fit into a recess in the hood's clips on one side, and on the other side you can push in an m3 screw from below and screw it into an M3 nut above.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIH/FGJO/IPWWSGM6/FIHFGJOIPWWSGM6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Mount It on Your Bike"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "And off we go, show off to the neighbourhood! It's normal for the wheel to take a few meters to get into rotating, but after that it worked at comfortable speeds for me. I hope you like it :)\nThe wings are beautiful but seem to need more work until the balance is right. In the future I'd love to have a small handle on the hood to temporarily turn off the flapping while riding your bike. I think this might be done easily: the lever would just lift or lower a cam that tightens or loosens the pullstring. If I manage to make such an addition, I will try to make it in a way so you don't have to print the hood again.\nIf you like the Bicycle Mascot and my instructable, please consider voting for me in the 3d printing contest!
