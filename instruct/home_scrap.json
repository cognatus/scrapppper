Both dedicated applications were eye sores having excessive cabling tangles and a clutter of dangling support hardware.\nInstructable Intro\nThe Instructable will begin by modifying the Mechanical Pivot connecting a non-VESA Dell Monitor to it\u2019s base, so it can be attached to a wall or an articulating arm. This step by step process of disassembly, modification and re-assembly will render a 180-degree reversed monitor arm. The process is also reversible if you want to return the monitor to a desk top mount, in the future.\nAfter the monitor modification section, I will present two different applications of equipment organization using dedicated aluminum tube wall mountings.\nThe first will be a detailed step by step, that will illustrate the principals of planning and hardware attachment specific to a triple monitor mount application.\nThe second will showcase an application of the principals previously established. This section is meant to inspire your creative energies.\nMy Instructable target audience is the novice. Those with advanced experience, can simply look over the photos and drawings to understand exactly how I did this, but I encourage you to read the exacting details of the step by step pivot modifications.\nRecycled Materials and Hardware\nAll of the aluminum tubing, lag bolts, machine screws and other hardware used here, was all salvaged from products or projects found in industrial / commercial dumpsters. The re-claimed aluminum tubing was sanded and brushed to remove scars and scratches. The hardware was brushed and cleaned with mineral spirits. The only pieces of new hardware and material used is one aluminum tube used for the triple monitor mount, one plastic drywall anchor, zip ties, three 6 mm machine screws and double-sided mounting tape.\nThe Tools, Hardware and Materials list is composed of the items needed only for the first two sections of this Instructable, since the third section is only a gallery showcase.\nTOOLS\nPencil\nBlack Marker\nMasking Tape\nTape Measure\nYard Stick\nCarpenter\u2019s Square\nBubble Level\n3/32\u201d or 1/8\u201d (slim blade) Standard Screwdriver\n#1 Phillips Screwdriver\n#2 Phillips Screwdriver\n#3 Phillips Screwdriver\nMetal File\nVise or Vise Grip Pliers\nNeedle Nose Pliers\nHammer\n8 mm Wrench\n7/16\u201d Nut Driver\n7/16\u201d 3/8 Drive Socket\n3\u201d or 6\u201d 3/8 Drive Socket Extension\n3/8 Drive Socket Wrench\nElectric Hand Drill with a \u00bd\u201d Chuck or Drill Bits with a \u00bc\u201d Shank.\n1/16\u201d Drill Bit\n11/64\u201d Drill Bit\n\u00bc\u201d Drill Bit\n3/8\u201d Drill Bit\n\u00bd\u201d Drill Bit\n11/16\u201d Drill Bit\nHARDWARE\nThree = 6 mm x 1.0 mm, 16 mm long Machine Screws, Phillips Pan Head, Stainless Steel 18-8\nThree = 6 mm (or \u00bc\u201d) Lock Washers, Stainless Steel 18-8\nTwo = \u00bc\u201d x 2\u201d Lag Bolts, Hex Head, Stainless Steel 18-8\nTwo = \u00bc\u201d Lock Washers, Stainless Steel 18-8\nOne = \u00bd\u201d Dry Wall Anchor (Plastic) with #8 - 1 \u00bc\u201d Pan Head Phillips Screw\nOne = 4D 1 \u00bd\u201d Common Nail\nOne = 3D 1 \u00bc\u201d Brad\n6\u201d = 3M Scotch 4011 Exterior Permanent Mounting Tape, 1 in wide\n10 = 6\u201d Zip Ties\nMATERIALS\n1 \u00bd\u201d x 1 \u00bd\u201d x 45\u201d (1/8\u201d wall) Aluminum Square Tubing\nTouch Up Paint (optional)\nFast Dry Latex Caulk (optional)\nMonitor Modification\nI have three identical 24\u201d Dell 2340 Monitors, which I\u2019ve used with my hobbyist level, CAD work station.

You then collect the sap from the buckets and haul it to an evaporator for processing. I have used this method for decades. It's low tech, simple and effective. Carrying all that sap is also a ton of work and hard on your body if you have lots of taps in. This year, in northern Wisconsin, it would have been impossible given the heavy snow cover on the ground. In the last couple of years I have been pondering how to set up a 3/16 inch pipeline. The problem I faced is that my maple trees are on flat ground in a remote location away from any power source. Gravity fed 3/16 inch pipeline systems require 50-60 ft of drop from the first tap in the line to the collection point to develop maximum vacuum and I only have 6-8 ft. One way around this is to use a vacuum pump, but I have no access to power to run a commercial maple sap vacuum pump. Additionally, commercial maple sap vacuum pumps are large, expensive, and complex - designed for big operations with extensive pipelines and thousands of taps. I wanted an inexpensive, environmentally friendly 12-volt system I could power with solar panels that would serve a couple of hundred taps. Enter the Shurflo pumps and inspiration from Spruce Creek Farms in Ontario, Canada. These 12V pumps are designed for use in RV's and boats. They are diaphragm pumps that have two attributes that make them perfect for this application - they can run dry without damage to the pump and they can handle the freezing and thawing that is integral to maple sap production. I have now built such a solar powered vacuum pump maple sap system and it\u2019s working great. This Instructable tells you how to replicate my vacuum pump system.\nThe smaller Shurflo 4008 pump (3 gal/min) shown in this Instructable will service around 200 taps and, in a decent year, should produce enough sap to make somewhere between 50 and 100 gallons of maple syrup. The larger Shurflo 4048 pump (4 gal/min) shown in the attached video will handle 300+ taps. In addition to the vacuum system you will need to purchase 3/16 inch tubing, taps, T-fittings and splices to set up your pipeline \u2013 I have about 5000 ft of 3/16 in pipeline with 240 taps strung over about 6 acres of maple trees. Generally, with 3/16 inch tubing they tell you to restrict the number of taps on each line to 25. I've read you can exceed this number, and I have several lines with 30-32 taps which seem to be working fine. Additionally, you will need a central collection tank (I use a 144 gal stock tank) and some sort of vehicle and transport tank to get your sap to your evaporator.", "title": "Off Grid Solar Powered Maple Sap Vacuum System", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Off-Grid-Solar-Powered-Maple-Sap-Vacuum-System/", "section": "home", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The attached pdf file has a complete list of components, suppliers and costs.

With a sharpie, mark the positive and negative sides of the bus bar.\nScrew a small block of wood 1.5in by 1.5in by 2.5in on the plywood next to the bus bar. You will attach the temperature controller to this block with a zip tie. Screw the solar charge controller and relay to the plywood next to the battery box. Screw the switch box for the master on/off switch to the plywood\nWiring\nUse 10 gauge wire for all connections between the battery, solar charge controller, relay, bus bar, master switch and pump. Use 12 gauge wire between the temperature controller, relay and bus bar.\nFuse and Master On/Off Switch\nThe purpose of the fuse and master off/on switch is to protect the circuitry and provide a way to turn the entire system on and off.\nCrimp a small ring fitting on the end of the fuse holder wire and attach to the positive bus bar. Depending on the size of the pump a 10 or 15 amp automotive spade fuse fits in the fuse holder. Use a butt crimp fitting to attach a 1 ft piece of red 10 gauge wire to the fuse holder and run into the switch box and attach to one terminal of the switch. Attach a second 1 ft piece of red 10 gauge wire to the other terminal on the light switch. The other end will attach to the red wire of the relay.\nRelay\nThe purpose of the relay is to allow more power to run to the pump than the contacts in the temperature controller can handle. When the temperature controller turns on, it sends a signal to the relay to turn on, which in turn sends power to the pump motor. The relay should have five colored wires coming out of it \u2013 white, black, red, blue and yellow. The yellow wire in the center is not used and can be cut off. Crimp a small ring fitting on the black wire and attach to the negative bus bar. Use a butt crimp fitting to attach the blue wire of the relay to the red wire of the pump. Crimp a small ring fitting on the black wire of the pump and attach to the negative bus bar. Use a butt crimp fitting to attach the red wire of the relay to the red wire coming from the master off/on switch. The white wire on the relay will attach to the red trigger wire coming from the temperature controller once the controller is installed.\nSolar Charge Controller\nThe purpose of the solar charge controller is to charge the deep cycle battery from the solar panels. It also monitors how much power the pump is using and compensates by sending the right amount of power to the battery to keep it charged.\nThe controller will have 3 slots each accepting a positive and negative wire. The first slot is the input from the solar panel. Attach a 2 foot piece of 10 gauge red and black wire to the positive and negative terminals. The wire coming from the solar panel will attach to these two pigtails with red twist on wire connectors. The second slot is to the battery. Crimp on large ring connectors at one end of a 2 ft length of 10 gauge red and black wire. Red connects to the positive and black to the negative battery terminals. The other end of the wires attach to the positive and negative terminals of the battery slot on the charge controller. The third slot is labeled \u201cload\u201d or will have a little light bulb icon. Crimp small ring connectors at one end of a 2 ft piece of 10 gauge red and black wire. Red connects to the positive bus bar and black to the negative bus bar - this connection \"powers\" the bus bar. The other end of the wires attach to the positive and negative terminals on the load slot of the charge controller. When attaching power to the charge controller always attach the battery before the solar panel. Reverse the process when disconnecting.\nTemperature Controller\nThe purpose of the temperature controller is to automate turning the system on and off. Maple trees run best when it freezes in the 20's at night and thaws in the 40's during the day. The controller measures the outside temp and turns the system on and off automatically.\nThe temperature controller will have 3 slots each accepting 2 wires. One slot should already have a temperature sensor attached. When the system is fully assembled the temperature sensor should be run outside the pump box on the shady side of the box through a small hole. The second slot is the power slot. Crimp on small ring connectors at one end of two 1 ft pieces of 12 gauge red and black wire. The red wire attaches to the positive bus bar, the black wire attaches to the negative bus bar. The other ends attach to the positive and negative terminals of the power slot of the temperature controller. The third slot is the trigger slot. Crimp on a small ring connector at one end of a 1 ft piece of 12 gauge red wire. The ring connector attaches to the positive bus bar. The other end attaches to one of the terminals in the trigger slot. To the other terminal in the trigger slot attach another 1 ft piece of 12 gauge red wire. This wire will attach to the white wire of the relay using a butt crimp fitting. Once the temperature controller is wired use a zip tie to attach to the block of wood you screwed to the plywood.\nSet your temperature controller to \u201ccooling mode\u201d to turn on at 33F and off at 32F. When the outside temp hits 33F and the temp controller turns on it will send a positive voltage to the relay, which in turn will turn on and send power to the pump. When the temp drops to 32F it will turn off.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCL/7MF6/JTWSU50O/FCL7MF6JTWSU50O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FML/8RUS/JTWSXZST/FML8RUSJTWSXZST.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ7/7SZW/JTWSXZAO/FJ77SZWJTWSXZAO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9R/ZGHS/JTT5QAAF/F9RZGHSJTT5QAAF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA9/2ZJI/JTWSXZE8/FA92ZJIJTWSXZE8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW9/AMEF/JTWSXZEV/FW9AMEFJTWSXZEV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRG/V06D/JTWSXZFE/FRGV06DJTWSXZFE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBP/PH5G/JTWSXZWL/FBPPH5GJTWSXZWL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0O/Y3UU/JTWSXZX6/F0OY3UUJTWSXZX6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZM/IVNA/JTWSU6AL/FZMIVNAJTWSU6AL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS4/7NMQ/JTWSXZYQ/FS47NMQJTWSXZYQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2J/NFHF/JTWSXZZA/F2JNFHFJTWSXZZA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Electrical"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Use some wire staples to secure all the wires to the plywood.

The larger Shurflo 4048 pump in the video draws more power so I added an additional 100 watt panel for a total of 260 watts. DC current needs big wires to flow any distance, so I recommend at least 10 gauge wire running from your panel(s) to the charge controller. Keep the wire the minimum length necessary. I have my panels about 75ft from my pump box in a clearing in the woods where they get maximum sunshine. I built some simple hinged frames out of 2X4\u2019s to hold the solar panels and adjust to face south and angle up at 45 degrees to get maximum sun exposure. As mentioned earlier, always attach the battery to your charge controller before you attach the solar panels. Reverse the process when disconnecting.\nVacuum Gauges\nA vacuum pump is most effective when there are no vacuum leaks in the system The best way to monitor this is with vacuum gauges. I attached one to an incoming sap line close to the pump box to measure the vacuum at the pump. I also put one at the end of each line. By monitoring these gauges you can tell if you have a vacuum leak. If there is a leak in the line, the vacuum will be much reduced or zero. You then need to walk the line and find the leak. It might be due to a squirrel chewing a hole through a line, or a fallen branch, or a damaged or dead tree leaking air into the system. You will see tubing full of sap with a few little bubbles up to the leak and tubing full of air after the leak. Have some splices handy to fix these leaks and you should be able to maintain 20-25 in of Hg near the pump and 15-20 in of Hg at the end of the lines. Long lines with more taps generally will have lower pressures at the end of the line.\nOptional 12 volt transfer pump\nYou will need some sort of pump to pump the sap out your collection tank into whatever tank you are using to transfer the sap to the sugar shack. I use a 12V 350 gal/hr transfer pump to transfer the sap from the collection tank to a 125 gal transfer tank on the back of my gator. The transfer pump is connected to the battery with large ring terminals. I have a short piece of garden hose with a shut off tap running out of the collection tank and another hose running from the transfer pump to the transfer tank.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBP/W6MU/JTWSU6S5/FBPW6MUJTWSU6S5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTO/3APM/JTYN73Y0/FTO3APMJTYN73Y0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFJ/LIZK/JTYN7418/FFJLIZKJTYN7418.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9T/ZTHZ/JTYN6VJ4/F9TZTHZJTYN6VJ4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBN/NBF7/JTYN6WGT/FBNNBF7JTYN6WGT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7J/0FXY/JTYN6U7I/F7J0FXYJTYN6U7I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWY/46JP/JTYN743D/FWY46JPJTYN743D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2X/3M3Z/JTYN744D/F2X3M3ZJTYN744D.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Additional Notes"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Take your finished pump box, your battery, your solar panels and your collection tank to the sugar bush.

After 18 years (and three kids) we decided it was time. In order to save money we knew we would be doing the majority of work ourselves- and we knew this was going to be a complete gut job right down to the studs.\nRemodeling a kitchen can be a scary proposition- it takes a lot of time, costs a lot of money and mistakes can be very expensive. If you're on a budget like us (and who isn't!) it can be a real minefield navigating all of the design decisions and trying to figure out how to get the most bang for your buck. Based on the before and after photos I'd say we met all our goals and made every dollar count!\nBe sure to click on the build photos as most of them have notes.\nHere's how we did it!", "title": "Kitchen Remodel on a Budget", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Kitchen-Remodel-on-a-Budget/", "section": "home", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Organization is the key.\nOur kitchen is fairly small with a footprint of roughly 92\" x 120\"- about 77 sq. ft. My wife and I always have a bit of a laugh when we watch home remodeling/buying shows and you see the buyers walking into ginormous kitchens with a 30+ sq. ft. island and the first thing they say is \"Well, it's a little small...\"\nWe've never had any problem cooking for our family or even up to 20+ people in our kitchen- but with two people in there it was pretty crowded. The way the kitchen was arranged was OK in terms of total storage space but it lacked working countertop surface area, the pantry wasn't user friendly (I also constantly hit my head on the shelves), the refrigerator door couldn't open fully (which frustrated my wife to no end) and you frequently had to close one cabinet door or appliance in order to access another area. There was also a lot of dead cabinet space in the corners.\nThe other big issue was that the kitchen was really dark and closed in and the sight lines into the dining/living area were terrible. It was time for a new floor plan.\nWe decided to organize the kitchen into working areas that made sense for how we use it. Food and dry goods are at one end of the kitchen and cooking at the other with dishes and pot/pans in between. In a small kitchen just moving things around a few inches here and there and reorganizing your workflow can make a world of difference. We wanted to maximize all of our available storage space and yet at the same time increase our physical working area and make the kitchen feel larger without increasing the footprint- a tall order.\nHere's what we did:\n1) We relocated the refrigerator to the pantry area. This allowed us to gain additional floor space and the refrigerator door could now fully open. You can fully remove shelves and storage bins from the refrigerator!\n2) We moved the pantry to the old refrigerator location and split it into upper and lower sections. We were able to retain the same pantry shelf/storage area as before but now we gained additional countertop area next to the oven (which we also moved closer to the sink by a few inches)- very handy for baking and cooking prep. We could now have both the pantry and refrigerator fully open at the same time, which is really nice when putting away groceries after shopping.\n3) We relocated the dishwasher next to the sink. The old dishwasher location (at a right angle to the sink) didn't make sense- it was always awkward trying to load/unload the dishwasher because you always had to reach out over the open door.\n4) The trash/recycling got moved next to the dishwasher. The trash used to be in the bottom of the old pantry area so if you were unwrapping food or scraping dishes you always had to go across the kitchen- it just didn't make sense.\n5) We made the sink smaller. Yes- smaller! By installing a smaller sink cabinet and a single bowl sink we actually got more usable area both in and around the sink. A single large bowl sink fit baking sheets and cooking pans better than our old double bowl sink and we gained countertop space. The smaller cabinet allowed us to move the dishwasher next to the sink.\n6) Removing the partition wall and overhead soffits and extending cabinets all the way up to the ceiling made a huge difference. Even though we removed overhead cabinets (looking out into the dining area) we gained that storage space back by extending the remaining wall cabinets up to the ceiling. We were also able to add a cabinet over the refrigerator in its new location. Removing the partition wall and soffits really opened up the kitchen- the sight lines are a night and day difference. The kitchen didn't feel cut off from the rest of the house anymore. If you are even the slightest bit unsure about removing or relocating a wall consult a structural engineer.\n7) We shrunk the countertop area next to the dining room. This countertop area was 36\" deep- by reducing that to 26\" we were able to gain a huge increase in kitchen foot traffic area and relocating the base cabinets allowed us to move the dishwasher next to the sink. The base cabinets underneath this countertop now hold serving dishes since this is the area that faces the dining room. Because we removed the partition wall we gained back a few square inches at the edge of the countertop and pushing the countertop back gave us better access to the countertop/storage area around the sink- the net result was a lot more useable space as well as a larger entry path into the kitchen.\n8) We added a lazy Susan cabinet to the corner by the stove. The old corner cabinet made it just about impossible to use the corner space for storage- it was like a black hole. Whatever went back there stayed back there. Now we keep cooking utensils, colanders and other frequently used odds and ends in the lazy Susan and it's all immediately accessible.\n9) Open shelving makes the kitchen feel larger. By adding floating shelves to the corners by the sink we gained back some storage space (helping keep items off the countertops) and it kept the area around the sink feeling more open.\nAt the beginning of our planning stage I had a contractor friend come over and have a quick look at things to make sure I wasn't missing anything out of the ordinary- sometimes just having a second set of eyes on something like a project this big can result in coming up with a better layout or bring to light something you hadn't thought of that could turn into a much bigger problem later. I drilled small holes in the soffits and walls and used a borescope to look into the walls to make sure there weren't going to be any major electrical, plumbing or venting obstructions that would throw a wrench in our plan. We originally had thought about the possibility of stealing space from a hallway closet but a flue pipe situated in a boxed in wall section put an end to that real quick as relocating it wasn't even remotely feasible.\nNow that we had a plan we had to figure out our budget...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ7/WNBO/JTWT00P6/FZ7WNBOJTWT00P6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5J/OA7C/JTWT00NH/F5JOA7CJTWT00NH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Design Considerations"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Figuring out a budget for a project like this is always a bit of a double edged sword. We don't have a money tree in the backyard but we still wanted to buy good quality materials. As far as time was concerned the longer our kitchen was going to be out of commission the more expensive it would become in terms of both work hours and cost of potentially eating out (which for a family of five can get really expensive really fast.)\nIt's also really important to check out current building codes and file for necessary permits.\n\nLabor plan-\nI figured I could take a total of 9 days off work and not dip too far into my paid time off. Adding in my normal days off per week meant I had 12 days in row to get the majority of work done. I called in a contractor friend (he would help with demo, flooring and drywall for a reasonable fee) and we figured out a rough schedule:\n2 days for demo work\n2-3 days for flooring\n3 days for drywall and electrical\n1 day for paint\n2 days for cabinets\n1 day for plumbing\nI would order the cabinets and once I had an arrival date we could begin construction. Once that work was done I could have the kitchen measured for countertops (approximately a 4-5 week total process) and I could work on finish/trim work, backsplash tiling and shelving on upcoming weekends. This meant I could have a working kitchen in 12 days and take my time doing finish work. Total build time start to finish was less than 8 weeks.\nIn order to save money on eating out we set up a small table with our toaster, coffee pot, microwave and crockpot/instapot. We also have an outdoor grill we could use for cooking. We moved our old refrigerator into our garage so we still had access to cold food. We used the sink in our laundry room for washing dishes. Not having a kitchen sink was probably the single most annoying thing about having our kitchen torn apart.\nDisposal costs can also add up fast. We salvaged as much as we could of our existing kitchen and donated materials (old sink, cabinet hinges, etc.) to our local ReCycle center. Instead of a rollaway dumpster we were able to fit construction waste into a Bagster.\n\nMaterials estimates-\nCabinets- $5200\nFlooring- $300\nElectrical/lighting- $500\nPlumbing- $150\nDrywall- $350\nBacksplash tile- $350\nSink- $175\nCountertops $2500-3300\nAppliances-\nOur dishwasher, oven, faucet and sink disposal were all in good shape. We did need to purchase a new refrigerator and microwave. I did an enormous amount of research on refrigerators. When we originally began planning our kitchen we thought we might want to put in a 36\" wide counter depth refrigerator as they are quickly becoming the most popular size unit. After looking at our available space it made much more sense to go with a 30\" wide standard depth unit. The depth would fit fine in the pantry area and the total storage capacity would be the same. Going with a 36\" wide refrigerator would have cost us about $2500 extra as not only are the refrigerators more expensive but we would have needed to bump out the wall 6\" in order to make it fit and we would have had to move a return air duct in the floor -it just wasn't worth it. We specifically did not want a water/ice dispenser in the door as the vast majority of complaints centered around this feature- especially with french door refrigerators.\nIn the end we settled upon this really nice KitchenAid single door model.\nWe thought we might want to install a vent hood above our oven but then the microwave would have had to live on the countertop, which didn't make much sense. Because of this we went with a venting microwave mounted above the oven. We chose this nice slimline Whirlpool microwave and it does everything we need and because it's so slim it frees up a lot of room above the oven.\nI found the best pricing I could online and my local appliance supplier was able to match it- both appliances were $2250 delivered.\nAt this point our total budget including helper labor was around $16-17k, which is right where we wanted to be.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FD2/W13A/JTWT00GZ/FD2W13AJTWT00GZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Budgeting -both Time and Money"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Once the budget is figured out and cabinets have arrived it's time for demo!\nAfter shutting off power and water we began by rolling out thick construction paper on our floors to protect the wood. Dismantling the overhead cabinets and non structural partition wall came first. Sometimes the best way to do this is to use a sawzall to cut right through framing nails- it's both faster and safer than pounding studs with a sledgehammer. The areas above the soffits were not drywalled in (we expected this) so we had insulation falling down on us while doing this.\nWe were sure to be extra careful around any areas that would contain electrical wiring or plumbing!\nWith the partition wall/countertop out of the way we could then move the oven and refrigerator out more easily and then remove all of the existing cabinetry. The cabinets were so bad they literally fell apart in our hands. After that came any remaining drywall that would need to be replaced due to previous damage or removal because of electrical rerouting and fitting of new boxes to wall studs.\nWe also removed all of the old parquet flooring at this time. I had previously encountered this last bastion of 80's design when we installed wood floors in our dining area and I had my secret weapon ready. After the flooring installers tried everything under the sun to remove the incredibly stubborn glued down tiles (including a very large, very loud industrial scraping machine) I improvised a removal tool by grinding a sharp edge on a garden border spade shovel. I found I could ram/slide the sharp edge of the spade under the wood tiles and with a bit of leverage they would pop right up. This improvised tool saved several hours of work- I offered to let the floor installer keep it because he liked it so much! Luckily our subfloor was in great shape and didn't require any repair work.\nWith the partition wall and soffits removed we were beginning to get a glimpse of how much more open our new kitchen would be!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3J/361L/JTYN7U1U/F3J361LJTYN7U1U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIR/S3N3/JTT5HAMX/FIRS3N3JTT5HAMX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMZ/TCV1/JTT5HAN1/FMZTCV1JTT5HAN1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTU/CW0E/JTT5HB5J/FTUCW0EJTT5HB5J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTZ/G2XK/JTT5HB8Z/FTZG2XKJTT5HB8Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBD/ABOJ/JTT5HB8Y/FBDABOJJTT5HB8Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLU/8WFV/JTT5HB91/FLU8WFVJTT5HB91.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDF/TYX7/JTT5HBE3/FDFTYX7JTT5HBE3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ9/L0AH/JTT5HBFS/FZ9L0AHJTT5HBFS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFP/8HE9/JTT5HC6P/FFP8HE9JTT5HC6P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCC/ZEKF/JTT5HC8G/FCCZEKFJTT5HC8G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKR/KR94/JTT5HCCK/FKRKR94JTT5HCCK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIW/IQ75/JTT5HCG3/FIWIQ75JTT5HCG3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F25/E41M/JTT5HCJG/F25E41MJTT5HCJG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Demo Work"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "We decided early on that we wanted tile floors.\nWhen we installed our wood floors throughout the upper floor of our house we thought we might extend them into the kitchen area. Wood floors in kitchens just look fantastic and they're nice to walk on. Unfortunately all it takes is one little unnoticed water leak to destroy them. Many of our friends have wood floors in their kitchens and every single one of them said they would never do it again. So we chose tile.\nThe big advantage of ceramic tile is that it's cheap and durable- with three kids, two cats and a large dog that's what made the most sense for us. The disadvantage is that it can be cold (especially if it's on ground level on a slab) and hard on your feet if you're standing in the kitchen all day. If I were a professional chef I don't think I'd want to be standing on tile all day. Another option is vinyl plank flooring- there are some varieties out there that are very resistant to water damage and it comes in a huge variety of finishes but it can be costly.\nThe tile we chose was the same variety as what we used in our bathrooms. At $1.19 per sq. ft. it's tough to beat for our requirements. The 12\" x 24\" tile size suited our space well too. I brought home a few different color examples and we went with a concrete gray color as it provided a nice transition from our wood floors while not being too dark for our small kitchen.\nA moisture barrier was put down underneath a backerboard and the tile was adhered using an appropriate mortar. It's super important to try and get the floor as level as possible as this will make installing cabinets and leveling appliances much easier later on. We also brought in one of the base cabinets and positioned it where the end of the peninsula would be located in order to get an idea as to how we would transition the tile to the wood floor in that area. After the tile had properly set it was grouted in with a Pearl Gray grout (I had a fair bit of this left over from when our bathrooms were remodeled.)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJU/KNAH/JTT5HCL5/FJUKNAHJTT5HCL5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLM/2D8G/JTT5JY3H/FLM2D8GJTT5JY3H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXS/53IM/JTT5HF2N/FXS53IMJTT5HF2N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F81/TYT0/JTT5HCMW/F81TYT0JTT5HCMW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKS/Y7T6/JTT5HCOM/FKSY7T6JTT5HCOM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F42/PHF8/JTT5HCQE/F42PHF8JTT5HCQE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Flooring"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "On to the electrical...\nSince we were relocating the refrigerator we needed to move an outlet to the new location and code also required GFCI protected tamper-resistant outlets to be located within 24\" from any break in the countertop (as in a sink or oven) as well as within 24\" from the end of a countertop located against a wall. We were good with already having two 20A appliance circuits and a 15A circuit for lighting. Refrigerators in residential spaces are not required to be GFCI protected.\nWe also needed to relocate the light switches and outlet that were situated in the now removed partition wall. When relocating items like this I always take photos of the existing wiring and label everything to avoid confusion later on. When you start remodeling you often find all sorts of \"interesting/creative\" wiring that needs to be corrected- usually improper grounding and lack of strain relief at the electrical boxes. When wiring new boxes I always make sure the wire is long enough to stick out 6\" from the box- nothing is worse than trying to replace an outlet or switch and not having enough wire to maneuver things around. I also tend to avoid push fit backstab connections in receptacles as they have a tendency to fail- I much prefer wiring to be secured by screws.\nOne thing I did do was replace all of the electrical boxes anywhere that would be tiled over later. I installed adjustable depth boxes which are awesome for tile work as they allow you to easily set the box to exactly the right depth from the drywall so when you tile later on they can be perfectly flush.\nFor lighting we wanted something really simple so I found some really great flush mount LED lights- these lights are awesome! They are super low profile, very simple to install and they have a separate driver box that is easy to wire plus you can change the color temp of the light, which is really nice. At $30 each they are a bargain. I installed these in the existing light locations. At this time we also decided to replace the light over our dining room table (not originally in our budget!) with a light that would match the smaller pendant light we would install over the kitchen peninsula.\nAnd plumbing...\nPlumbing was pretty straightforward as we were going from a double bowl sink to a single bowl so it actually simplified things a bit. However I did manage to screw things up and measured the base cabinet dimensions incorrectly so I had to move the sink waste line over a couple inches for clearance- not a big deal. Since the new sink would be plumbed differently I had to replace everything forward of the elbow coming out of the wall. This meant installing a \"T\" fitting for an air vent (I like the kind that screw in place) and a new trap for the disposal outlet. The air inlet vent must be placed at least 4\" above the waterline in the sink trap.\nRelocating the refrigerator also required a new water line for the icemaker so that was run. It was bit time consuming but worked out just fine. The cold water line to our water heater is located in our basement downstairs underneath our kitchen so I just needed to drill a hole through the subfloor and route the copper line along the floor joists to the shutoff valve. For around $30 in materials I was good to go.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8G/VIXG/JTT5HAMY/F8GVIXGJTT5HAMY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW2/4SWL/JTT5HCTR/FW24SWLJTT5HCTR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM3/PSY0/JTT5HCW6/FM3PSY0JTT5HCW6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5X/WB4R/JTT5HCXV/F5XWB4RJTT5HCXV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV1/W7B6/JTT5HD2X/FV1W7B6JTT5HD2X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO8/IOBX/JTWT00HS/FO8IOBXJTWT00HS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT2/95N3/JTT5HD2Z/FT295N3JTT5HD2Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCV/YGH4/JTT5HD6C/FCVYGH4JTT5HD6C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3F/VE6A/JTT5HDW0/F3FVE6AJTT5HDW0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYP/8UBK/JTT5HE15/FYP8UBKJTT5HE15.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXZ/MFRW/JTT5HE2U/FXZMFRWJTT5HE2U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7W/GVQ7/JTT5RGMZ/F7WGVQ7JTT5RGMZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6Q/G0OK/JTT5HEVS/F6QG0OKJTT5HEVS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTY/T64Q/JTT5HEU3/FTYT64QJTT5HEU3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9W/SOJX/JTT5HEXH/F9WSOJXJTT5HEXH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNM/PKDS/JTT5HG7F/FNMPKDSJTT5HG7F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBU/SK5J/JTT5HF2M/FBUSK5JJTT5HF2M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW1/90YB/JTT5HF69/FW190YBJTT5HF69.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQL/GYBG/JTT5HF6P/FQLGYBGJTT5HF6P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFS/KRJ1/JTT5HF6X/FFSKRJ1JTT5HF6X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIJ/DSUD/JTT5HF6Y/FIJDSUDJTT5HF6Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4W/TJZ9/JTT5HF73/F4WTJZ9JTT5HF73.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXD/EU3O/JTYN7TW6/FXDEU3OJTYN7TW6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD4/VFP5/JTT5HG8H/FD4VFP5JTT5HG8H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ1/E9D7/JTT5HEJV/FQ1E9D7JTT5HEJV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDL/JI2V/JTT5HELK/FDLJI2VJTT5HELK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Electrical and Plumbing"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "I must admit I am not a huge fan of drywall work.\nI'm OK with cutting drywall and screwing it down in place but I'm not really good at finishing it. Luckily for me the guy I hired to help on this project is awesome at drywall and I learned a lot from him. Getting the drywall in place was no big deal- just screw it in and tape the seams with patching compound. I keep some of this compound around the house for quickly fixing dents and holes in walls- it's great stuff.\nOnce that's done the finishing begins. A smooth finish isn't hard to get- it's when you have to texture a surface to match an existing surface that can be a bit tricky. In order to do this joint compound is thinned down and sprayed through a hopper texture spray gun. Once it starts to dry a bit it can be scraped down using large steel spatulas. If done right it just skims a bit off the top and leaves a nice slightly flattened textured surface. If the joint compound hasn't dried enough it will just smear around. Once everything fully dried I used a sanding sponge to smooth over any rough surfaces.\nNext I primered all of the surfaces and finish painted all areas that would not be covered by cabinets or tile. Drywall should be primered before installing backsplash tile. My favorite paint to use is Valspar Signature as it's reasonably priced and has great coverage and a nice finish. Don't believe the \"paint and primer\" bit though- drywall should still be primered before painting as you'll get a better finish and unfinished drywall can really soak up paint.

When we first started planning our kitchen I did a ton of research and looked at everything from big home improvement store brands to RTA (ready to assemble) cabinets to even building them from scratch.\nMost everything I found was either obscenely expensive or had poor to marginal case construction for what they cost. Fortunately I found an online supplier with exactly what I was looking for- Cabinets.com\nI have to say I was pretty leery of ordering cabinets online but I read a lot of good reviews so I ordered a couple of sample doors (at no charge) and we thought they looked really nice. All of their cabinets feature solid plywood case construction (no particle board or MDF) and high quality soft close hinges and drawer slides. When ordering cabinets there are also a few custom options that are available, such as selecting door opening direction, glass doors and cabinet depth. All cabinets arrive fully finished with drawers and doors installed. Orders over $2500 ship free.\nWe wanted to use European style cabinets since they maximize the cabinet space due to the lack of face frames- we need every square inch we can get in our small kitchen. The style/color we chose is an off white called Lombard Maple Alabaster. The cabinets are built to order and the lead time is 5-8 weeks. I ordered them at the end of the year (when they ran a 20% off sale plus an additional promo code for another 5% off- and they run them frequently) as well as toe kick trim and spacer panels to fit near the dishwasher. The 3\" wide spacer panels are necessary for handle clearance when opening the dishwasher and trash receptacle.\nThe total for our order (14 cabinets plus trim panel/spacer panels and toe kick panels) came to $5112.04\nI also ordered our kitchen sink at this time. We chose a Dawn 22\" single bowl undermount stainless sink. This is the largest sink I could find that still fit in 24\" wide sink cabinet and the price/quality is excellent.\n\nTime to install cabinets!\nOne trick I did when doing the drywall installation was to make a map of our wall stud locations by taking photos and measuring the distances between studs- it also gave me a good future reference for any electrical and plumbing lines. That way I knew exactly where to locate cabinet screws during installation.\nBefore installation began I made a vent cover box for the floor vent that is situated underneath our sink cabinet. The vent box is a sealed enclosure that directs air out from under the sink cabinet and exits through a grate in the toe kick. This was made from scrap lumber, covered inside with aluminum duct tape and sealed tight to the floor. I didn't know about it at the time but you can now buy ducting kits for this if you don't want to build a box.\nI started with the wall cabinets as it a lot easier to install them when you don't have to reach over the base cabinets. I also removed the doors and the shelves to make them lighter and reduce the risk of damaging a door. I started in the far corner and screwed a ledger to the wall to support the wall cabinets during installation. Installing wall cabinets is definitely a two person job- my son held the cabinets (supported by the ledger) while I screwed them in place.\nRarely do houses have square/plumb walls and level floors so cabinets frequently require shimming to get the cabinet faces even. The cabinets have anchoring slats across the upper and lower back so when driving in anchoring screws be sure to have the screws go through any shims to hold them in place. Cabinets should also be screwed to each other through the cabinet side panels (make sure to use the correct length screw so it doesn't poke through!)\nBase cabinet installation begins by checking the floor with a level and locating any high points- this is where you want to start, preferably in a corner. I started with the lazy Susan cabinet and worked my out from there, shimming as necessary and checking the top surface of the cabinets to make sure they were level. Holes were cut in place in the back and bottom of the sink cabinet to accommodate plumbing. This is definitely an area where you want to measure twice and cut once. Once the sink was fixed in place with silicone adhesive and the undersink plumbing was installed I installed the dishwasher and the 3\" wide filler strips.\nNext came the peninsula base cabinets. These were anchored to the floor using 1x2 strips and screws through the bases/toe kick area. Finally I installed the cabinet that sits above the refrigerator in the old pantry area. This was accomplished by fitting 1x4 solid wood slats as fillers and screwing the cabinet in place through the side panels. The fillers were necessary because the cabinet is the same width as the refrigerator (30\" wide) and the refrigerator requires breathing room on each side.\nAfter all the cabinets were in I reattached shelves and doors and made any necessary adjustments to the hinges to get the doors lined up properly.\nIf your existing cabinets are in good condition you can save a ton of money by updating them by either refinishing/painting them and/or installing new doors. If functionality is a concern take a look at Rev-A-Shelf as they make several different types of cabinet pullouts that greatly improve storage access.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAK/OUNI/JTYN7UKJ/FAKOUNIJTYN7UKJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYX/XR78/JTT5HF6A/FYXXR78JTT5HF6A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV5/N6QZ/JTT5HF6C/FV5N6QZJTT5HF6C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1D/LQ77/JTT5HF6B/F1DLQ77JTT5HF6B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6T/6YH3/JTT5HF6F/F6T6YH3JTT5HF6F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL9/UDJ1/JTT5HF6I/FL9UDJ1JTT5HF6I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWW/OE2Q/JTT5HF6K/FWWOE2QJTT5HF6K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7E/7ECB/JTWT00HD/F7E7ECBJTWT00HD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFZ/DXZ9/JTT5HF74/FFZDXZ9JTT5HF74.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F32/68T8/JTT5HF75/F3268T8JTT5HF75.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F56/GPN9/JTT5HH1K/F56GPN9JTT5HH1K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB9/8HB1/JTT5HF7U/FB98HB1JTT5HF7U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLK/EHO6/JTT5HF7V/FLKEHO6JTT5HF7V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F95/YODB/JTT5HFCO/F95YODBJTT5HFCO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKS/JRYE/JTT5HFEF/FKSJRYEJTT5HFEF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1W/1PBK/JTT5HFG8/F1W1PBKJTT5HFG8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVM/OPL2/JTT5HFWH/FVMOPL2JTT5HFWH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOK/8PQR/JTT5HG8N/FOK8PQRJTT5HG8N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV7/NFXC/JTT5HFN7/FV7NFXCJTT5HFN7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYG/SPOU/JTT5HGUA/FYGSPOUJTT5HGUA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRR/MC18/JTT5HFLE/FRRMC18JTT5HFLE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFP/V94A/JTT5HFRD/FFPV94AJTT5HFRD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9Q/A9DS/JTT5HFT2/F9QA9DSJTT5HFT2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMY/EQ3R/JTT5HFY8/FMYEQ3RJTT5HFY8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9C/QDR7/JTT5HG7B/F9CQDR7JTT5HG7B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU3/BW29/JTT5HG75/FU3BW29JTT5HG75.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU5/PLAD/JTYNF9FK/FU5PLADJTYNF9FK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3W/7M5Y/JTYNF9FI/F3W7M5YJTYNF9FI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDP/QG6C/JTYNF9FJ/FDPQG6CJTYNF9FJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Ordering and Installing Cabinets"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Now it was starting to look like a kitchen again!\nTo finish off the peninsula the side of the end cabinet was faced with 3/4\" birch plywood and the 1/4\" thick finish paneling was attached to the cabinet backs and side of the end cabinet over the plywood. I then fit the toe kick panels and ran baseboard trim around the peninsula back/side as well as around the refrigerator cutout.\nNext I fit corner moulding to the peninsula corners as well as a trim strip along the top edge. This tied everything together really nicely and gave it a finished look.\nSince the backsplash tile was going to go all the way to the ceiling we decided to install trim around the window as well in order to have a finished edge for the tile to butt up against. The window ledge was removed and replaced with a longer piece that would accommodate the width of the trim that would go around the window. For window trim we used the same profile that went around all of the doorways in our house to tie it in for a cohesive look.\nThe paneling on the back and side of the peninsula was already finished with the same color as our cabinet doors so all I needed to do was prime and paint the remaining wood trim and baseboards.\nAt this point in time our refrigerator and microwave had arrived so they were installed and I took some scrap plywood and placed it on top of the cabinets so we could begin using our kitchen again while we waited for our countertops to arrive.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCL/X7ZD/JTT5HG8V/FCLX7ZDJTT5HG8V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDV/F9DF/JTT5HG92/FDVF9DFJTT5HG92.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP1/UFQ4/JTT5HG95/FP1UFQ4JTT5HG95.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHJ/BJVO/JTT5HGU1/FHJBJVOJTT5HGU1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4M/7IHC/JTT5HGU2/F4M7IHCJTT5HGU2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQJ/BX9E/JTT5HGU4/FQJBX9EJTT5HGU4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3K/VYXD/JTT5HGU5/F3KVYXDJTT5HGU5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPB/PA6J/JTT5HGU6/FPBPA6JJTT5HGU6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHP/VW1E/JTT5HGU7/FHPVW1EJTT5HGU7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Trim and Painting"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Choosing countertops... decisions, decisions.\nWhen shopping for countertops we again did a ton of research. It's always a tossup between usability/durability/appearance and cost. We weren't big fans of granite. Soapstone, while gorgeous, was too dark for our small space- not to mention bananas expensive. Solid surface material like LG HI-MACS (similar to Corian) looked nice and the pricing is great but the reviews were a bit mixed on it in terms of durability.\nIn the end it came down to two contenders- butcher block vs. Silestone Quartz.\nButcher block can be extremely durable (as in it will last forever as long as you use end grain or edge grain variety of a good quality hardwood) and it has a wonderful warmth to it. It's softer than stone or a solid surface top, which is both good and bad- it won't damage dishes as easily as stone and it's quiet when you place dishes on it BUT it also scratches easily, you can't let water pool up on it and it can look a bit beat up if not properly maintained (although some people call that character.) It requires a bit of maintenance (coating with food grade mineral oil every 6 months) but it can be easily refinished in place and doesn't require specialist installation. You can use knives on it! It's also very affordable relative to a lot of other options and provided it's in stock the lead time is zero. Most butcher block material is around 1.5\" thick. If you install it yourself you can find nice material for under $20/sq. ft.\nQuartz is also extremely durable and is about the lowest maintenance material out there. If you want a material that looks beautiful that you can just install and forget about it then quartz is for you. It has a wonderful high end feel to it. Standard thickness is typically 30mm. Sink cutouts are typically $300 ish and fancy edges cost extra (an eased edge is usually standard.) Quartz must be installed by a professional shop and as such prices range from around $70/sq. ft. to WHAT IN THE HE HAW ARE YOU THINKING- IS THAT QUOTE FOR REAL?!\nSo of course we chose Quartz. Because that's what my wife reallyreally wanted.\nShe wanted a bright white countertop (we chose White Zeus Extreme- where do they get these names?) to keep the kitchen light and felt that butcher block was going to be too dark in our space and the maintenance would be a bit much. As usual she was right so I went to get quotes for Quartz. The rule here is shop around, read testimonials and wait for sales (if you can.) The first quote I got from a recommended shop was an eye watering $5942 -about $156 per sq. ft. and waayyy out of our budget. While I'm sure that shop did fantastic work there was just no way we could afford that.\nAfter shopping around and seriously thinking about butcher block again I heard our local Lowe's was having a 20% off sale on Silestone Quartz. I used a Lowe's charge to save another 5% (which we immediately paid off as soon as the bill arrived) and we got the countertops we wanted for $2594- roughly $68 sq. ft. installed including sink cutout and eased edge. Before signing on the line I found out the name of the local supplier/installer and checked out reviews on them.\nWhen all was said and done it did take a total of about five weeks from order to install but they did a fantastic job, they look amazing and are exactly what we wanted.\nI would say in situation with a slightly larger kitchen with an island I would be tempted go with a butcher block island surface and Quartz everywhere else. If you mix the two materials and they share a common edge (say if you did Quartz in a sink area and butcher block on adjacent areas) make sure to adjust the cabinet heights to accommodate the difference in material thickness.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5T/CWST/JTT5HHG3/F5TCWSTJTT5HHG3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO3/354N/JTT5HHNE/FO3354NJTT5HHNE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBS/SFQ8/JTT5HHG4/FBSSFQ8JTT5HHG4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Countertops"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "Now that countertops were in we could choose backsplash tile!\nTile is one area where you can save a lot of money as the price range could be anywhere from $4 to over $20 per sq. ft. Originally we thought we would go for traditional size subway tile and I brought home multiple samples of different colors and textures as well as glass and porcelain varieties. With white cabinets and white countertops we wanted a bit of color for the backsplash tile- something in the blue/gray area that would pull a bit of the blue tones out of the floor tile and yet not be too dark overall. The color of the countertops and grout will definitely affect the appearance of the tile.\nWe also looked at tile with a glazed crackle finish as it can be very subtle and beautiful but we couldn't find any in just the right shape/color combination. If you use tile with this surface finish be sure to apply a sealer to it before setting and grouting as mastic/thinset and grout can get into the tiny cracks and it will be a nightmare to remove.\nIn the end the tile that won was Elida Ceramica Havana Nights- a smaller mosaic subway tile that has a really nice color that isn't too gray or green with just a little bit of blue in it. The alternating pattern and smaller size made it a lot more interesting looking than the larger more plain subway tile we had seen and the size seemed to fit our kitchen space better. At less than $5 per sq. ft. (we needed about 43 sq. ft. total) it was definitely priced right too.\nOne thing about tile that you have to consider is how it's going to look next to trim and how it is going to fit in a corner or look if you have an exposed edge. It's important to consider the overall thickness of the tile and also allow for the thickness of the tile adhesive.\nTile Installation.\nSpeaking of adhesive, you basically have two choices- mastic or thinset. While I would never use mastic in a bathroom or any area that would be immersed in water it's perfectly fine for a kitchen backsplash. The advantage of mastic is that it's premixed and it's faster to use than thinset. Mastic is super tacky so it holds tile to a vertical surface really well. If we had gone with a glass tile then I would have used thinset as glass tile isn't compatible with mastic due to the transparent nature of the glass. Many tile manufacturers will recommend a particular adhesive to use.\nThe tile was installed over a weekend. I was lucky enough to be able to borrow a wet saw from a friend to do the majority of cutting, saving me the time and trouble of renting or purchasing a saw (and reselling it on craigslist afterward.) Small trim cuts were made using a diamond blade in an angle grinder in order to cut tile to fit around electrical boxes.\nWhen setting tiles I start with a full height layer on the bottom row. Subway tiles in a corner are set in an alternating pattern so it looks more continuous as it wraps around the corner. Smaller mosaic tiles are typically adhered to a netting material which makes them easier to apply. You can cut through the netting with a utility knife in order to make small adjustments to tile spacing- sometimes this is necessary when working around things like electrical boxes and wood trim so you don't up with thin slivers of tile to fill in a gap. Setting tile isn't as much hard to do as it is time consuming, especially when you have to cut a lot of little trim pieces.\nIt's usually less expensive to go with a grout that isn't pre mixed but I was pressed for time so I went with pre mixed grout this time. The nice thing about pre mixed grout is that it's super consistent in terms of color and thickness and the type I used doesn't require any sealing afterward. Typically sanded grout is used when you have to fill larger gaps (say over 1/8\") and unsanded grout is used for thin gaps.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCG/7B99/JTT5HIG3/FCG7B99JTT5HIG3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6C/3ZA7/JTT5HIG2/F6C3ZA7JTT5HIG2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9F/EK3E/JTT5HIHS/F9FEK3EJTT5HIHS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6D/2BSR/JTT5HISE/F6D2BSRJTT5HISE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Q/7SMK/JTT5HJ1C/F8Q7SMKJTT5HJ1C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO2/5HTK/JTT5HJ8M/FO25HTKJTT5HJ8M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9H/AFXH/JTT5HJHK/F9HAFXHJTT5HJHK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSK/BLGM/JTYN7TV7/FSKBLGMJTYN7TV7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJK/NW31/JTT5HJS7/FJKNW31JTT5HJS7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJG/5PQV/JTT5HK15/FJG5PQVJTT5HK15.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR1/KFE0/JTT5HKBT/FR1KFE0JTT5HKBT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCH/LUMK/JTT5HKZF/FCHLUMKJTT5HKZF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBC/R2SO/JTT5HLZ0/FBCR2SOJTT5HLZ0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1T/AVQL/JTWT00GY/F1TAVQLJTWT00GY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: Tile Work"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "The final project was to install floating shelves.\nFloating shelves have a really nice open feel. For this we wanted something that was a bit more rustic and warm so we opted for using reclaimed wood that used to be flooring in an old factory. This was basically an edge grain 1.5\" thick butcher block material made from various hardwoods with a nice color that complimented the Hickory floors in our house.\nThe material came in 12\" wide sections so I first cut it down to 10\" width. Each shelf was then cut to 24\" length. After that it was cleaned up just a little bit with a planer and holes were drilled in to accept mounting pegs.\nThe pegs were screwed into studs in the walls to provide adequate support. Of course this meant I had to drill holes through the tile I just set! Drilling holes in tile can be a bit of a pain- for this job I used these Bosch tile drills and they worked really well. Just remember to go slow and frequently dip the drill bit in water so it doesn't overheat. Let the drill bit do the cutting- if you push too hard you can crack your beautiful tile you just set.\nThe most difficult part of this project was getting the holes for the pegs in exactly the right spot so everything lined up properly- it really helps to make a drilling jig or template. Once drilled the shelves are then pushed onto the pegs and tapped into place with a mallet. The bottom edges of the pegs have a knurled surface that provides a tight friction fit so the shelves are held onto the pegs securely. If screwed into the wall studs these are quite strong and can hold a fair bit of weight- I wouldn't set a large bag of dry cat food on them but they'll hold small dishes just fine.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1B/IURG/JTT5HKKU/F1BIURGJTT5HKKU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F80/01UT/JTT5HMAA/F8001UTJTT5HMAA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW6/V7XW/JTT5HMJ9/FW6V7XWJTT5HMJ9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1M/PF5T/JTT5HMS7/F1MPF5TJTT5HMS7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3G/MC6G/JTT5HPCR/F3GMC6GJTT5HPCR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH5/R590/JTT5HPRI/FH5R590JTT5HPRI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 11: Shelving"}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "This is by far the biggest project I've ever taken on.\nIt was a tremendous amount of planning and work but we are thrilled with the results and we now have the bright, open and super functional kitchen we always wanted.

This time I have come up with a 3 in 1 tripod project, which resembles those one in the commercial market. I have also added some other functions to make it more interesting and unique.\nI did have some idea of making the tripod at the beginning and refereed some instructables projects to get some practical ideas on it. I'm mentioning those links below. Along with these, I also refereed some commercial tripod designs to get more idea about the design work.\n1) https://www.instructables.com/id/Homemade-Tripod/\n2) https://www.instructables.com/id/PVC-Selfie-Stick-...\n3) https://www.instructables.com/id/Dual-tripod-with...\nI\u2019m also participating in the Remix contest and if you find this project interesting, then please support my work by voting for me.\nI believe this multipurpose tripod is a good upgrade and a remixed version of a normal DIY tripod. Coming up with a feasible design and a build plan for this 3 in 1 tripod project was very interesting and challenging for me and I'm glad that it turned out well. Since my design doesn't involve any 3D printing, any one with few hand tools could build this project without further setup. Also everything is designed mostly with PVC fittings and thus the build cost is very low. I also really wish to make a 3D printed version of this project, but unfortunately I don't have one. So if any one is attempting it, please let me know and I'll be very glad to hear that.\nBefore we start I would like to take a moment to give you an overview about the projects. What I have made is a portable multipurpose tripod for smartphones. The overall design is similar to those seen in the market but there is much more to the story. This one could serves as a tripod, a selfie stick and a car phone holder, thus the name 3 in 1 tripod. Further, the tripod legs are fixed in a particular arrangement so that by twisting the upper body, the legs would arise and transform into the tripod. The idea behind implementing such a design was to provide a much sturdy leg base. As we could see in the conventional ones, the legs have a single hinge support which could be unfolded by hands to form the tripod setup. This may however have a tendency to collapse during use. Since in my design the legs could be only unfolded by the twist mechanism, the legs don\u2019t collapse under any other circumstances. Implementing such a design into the tripod was a bit daunting but at last I came up with a good solution.\nThe car phone mount feature could fix the phone on the car air vent and this would be helpful for the usual needs like map navigation and all. Further the car mount could be coupled with the selfie stick setup so that the phone could be fixed at different highests & positions. This opens a more possibilities for vlogging, and videography inside the car.\nI have also made a Bluetooth camera shutter wristband so that it could be either strapped on to the tripod body or to the hand wrist. This makes it easier to operate the camera from a distance without any trouble. So I hope this would give you a brief idea about the project.\nI have also put extra effort for making the tripod to look good in both proportionate & aesthetic way. For those who are trying to attempt this project, I would suggest you to stick with my dimensions or a proportionate value.\nAlong the way I\u2019ll be mentioning things like 0.5 inch pipe 0.75 inch sockets and all. So just to make it clear for everyone, the measurement in inches would be the diameter of that section. It\u2019s the standard way of naming a PVC section. Also I\u2019ll be mentioning the length of the sections in cm. So just don\u2019t confuse between these two. Being that said, let\u2019s get into the details.", "title": "How to Make a 3 in 1 Tripod", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-3-in-1-Tripod/", "section": "home", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "As you can see from the picture, the legs are made from cutting a PVC pipe into 3 equal pieces. The pipe have a diameter of 1.5 inch and a length of 10cm. In order to cut the pipe into 3 equal pieces, I first measured the circumference of the pipe with a paper strip. Using a ruler the length was founded out (12.8cm), which in turn is the actual circumferential length of the pipe. So in order to mark 3 equal sections on the pipe, a strip having one third of this length (12.8/3=4.2cm) is cut out. This cut out could be now placed on the pipe to mark the 3 equal sections. Then using a hack saw the sections are cut out into 3 equal pieces. It goes without saying that the edges are sanded after cutting.\nAnother important aspect to consider while choosing the PVC pipe is to use the one with minimum wall thickness. The pipe that I used have a thickness about 2.1mm. On a later stage we are adding some layers of cloth over the legs for aesthetic looks. So it will automatically add up the thickness and thus it\u2019s better to use the pipe having minimum thickness.\nNext step is to make the hinge support which connects these legs to the main body. The hinge should support the entire weight of the tripod along with the wear due to the leg movement. So going for a metal hinge would be the proper solution. Since aluminium is much easier to cut & machine than steal I preferred it more. For an electronic hobbyist like me the next thing that came into my mind is to make the hinges from an aluminium heat sink. The sections were cut accordingly as seen in the picture. Further 2 vertical & 2 horizontal holes (2.9mm hole diameter) were drilled on the heat sink. The vertical holes were used to fix the heat sink onto the legs and horizontal ones were used for the hinge support and the twist unlock mechanism for the legs. It would be explained in detail in upcoming sessions. The hinges were fixed to the 3 legs using small bolt & nuts. The holes on the legs were drilled in such a way that, a length of 1.5cm of the hinge should extends from the legs. To make things fail proof, I super glued the bolts so that it won\u2019t come off. This completes the leg setup. While seeing the hinges it\u2019s sure that some portion has been cut off to form a particular shape. For understanding this some other things has to be said first so, we\u2019ll discuss about this in the later section.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7U/QCLN/JTT5LLXO/F7UQCLNJTT5LLXO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9M/DVM5/JTT5LLXQ/F9MDVM5JTT5LLXQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7F/0MKU/JTT5LLZ7/F7F0MKUJTT5LLZ7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRK/GHHV/JTT5LM50/FRKGHHVJTT5LM50.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTJ/RP6Y/JTT5LMAU/FTJRP6YJTT5LMAU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS0/GNAV/JTT5LMAV/FS0GNAVJTT5LMAV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE8/W9CJ/JTT5LLZE/FE8W9CJJTT5LLZE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Making the Legs"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The main body of the tripod is made up of a male and female threaded socket. First we\u2019ll discuss a about the 1.25 inch female threaded socket. The legs are attached to this section using bolts but in order to accommodate the hinges, 3 slits should be cut on this section. To make this clear, the socket have a threaded end & a non-threaded end. The slits are made on the non-threaded end so that the threaded end should be facing up. Most of these sockets do come with a hexagonal design on the circumference. This makes our job super easy. Find the midpoint of the alternate hexagonal sides and cut a slit wide enough to fit the hinges and we are done. The alternate sides of the hexagon automatically sets the angle between the slits as 120 degree and no further complications. You can use a hack saw and a soldering iron to cut the slits.

Since the male socket consist of few extra parts arranged inside it, it\u2019s more time consuming to build than the female socket. Also it\u2019s the most important part of the entire tripod because it provides the twist unfold mechanism of the tripod legs and the locking of the selfie stick extension poles.\nThe male socket would be coupled with the female socket (simply by tightening the threads) at the final assembly. It\u2019s the threaded rotation of the sockets which makes the legs swing out and swing in. This mechanism of the legs opening while rotating the male threaded socket is similar to the design used in an umbrella. When we open an umbrella, a metal part sliding on the main extension pole goes up, all the spokes connected to this metal part stretches out and thus unfolds the umbrella cloth. Similarly the reverse happens while we close an umbrella. This same mechanism is adopted to unfold the tripod legs. I hope you have noticed a black PVC plunger concealed by the legs becomes visible while the legs get opened. Well this is the thing which goes up and down to unfold & fold the legs respectively. Like those spokes on an umbrella, we have 3 hook setup connecting the legs to the plunger. More details on the hooks later.\nThe second function of the male threaded socket is to provide the necessary grip for the PVC extension poles. Without the grip setup, the extension pole will be loosely moving through the socket and would be total useless. In order for both of functions to work additional parts has been inserted in the socket and it\u2019s listed below.\n1) The plunger head\n2) The PVC grip ring\n3) The concealing section\n4) The washer lock plate\n5) 4 bolts and nuts\nNow let\u2019s discuss each part in detail.\n1) The plunger head\nLike I said before, when the male threaded socket rotates on the female sockets, two type of motion occurs. One the rotating motion & second, the linear motion of the socket while rotating on the thread. However we only need the liner motion for the leg mechanism and should totally arrest the rotation motion. This is where the plunger head (made up of PVC fittings) comes into play. It is free to rotate inside the male socket and thus the rotation motion from the male socket is not transferred to the plunger and instead only the linear motion of the socket turning through the thread is transferred to the plunger. In short when the male socket is tightened, the plunger moves down and if it\u2019s loosened then the plunger goes upwards.\nThis plunger system has two separate parts. One is within the male socket called the plunger head and the other outside the male socket called the plunger body. Let\u2019s focus on the plunger head now.\nThe plunger head is made by joining a 3/4 inch PVC pipe on a 3/4 inch end cap. Both the fittings are joined by PVC solvent. Then the closed side of the end cap is cut off in such a way that only 1 cm of the end cap remains. This completes the plunger head section.\n2) The PVC grip ring\nAs I said before, the male socket also serves the function of holding the telescopic extension poles of the selfie stick. This PVC grip ring inside the male socket deals with it. For making it, cut the junction of a 1 inch to 0.75 inch PVC reducer. This leaves us with two parts and take the 0.75 inch part. Now cut a 1 cm slit on it. Next step is the heat it with a heat gun and reduce its current diameter. Since the PVC pipe used for the telescopic extension poles are of 0.5 inch, this grip ring should be a bit smaller than the 0.5 inch so that it could firmly get a friction the surface. So the PVC ring is heated and reduced to a bit smaller diameter. But don\u2019t overdo it since too smaller diameter ring would be tough to fit so find a sweet spot. You could reheat and tweak to the optimum diameter to your satisfaction. This finishes this section\n3) The concealing section\nRemember the other half of the PVC reducer from which the previous grip ring is made? Well it\u2019s the concealing section. It encloses the male socket to form a closed structure. Now insert the previous top plunger section into the male threaded socket followed by the concealing section. We need the concealing section to align with the top portion of the male socket to make it aesthetically look good. But unfortunately the plunger section kills the space and the concealing section pops out from the male socket. So necessary cutting should be done at the bottom side of the concealing section so that it perfectly aligns with the top portion of the male socket. Now drill 4 holes on the male socket so that it extends to the top covering section placed inside. This results in 4 hole on the male socket corresponding to the 4 holes on the top covering section. We\u2019ll insert bolts through this holes at a later stage.\nNow it\u2019s time to assemble the male socket section. Insert the top plunger section followed by the PVC grip ring and the top covering section. The grip ring is free to rotate inside this setup and the slit on it makes it easy to fix the bolts form inside. Align the ring in front of a hole and insert the bolt from inside. Then rotate the ring to align with the next hole and the process is repeated for the 3 holes. However the final bolt insertion is a bit different. Since the ring is freely rotating inside the setup, the PVC extension pipes inserted through the grip ring would be also free to rotate which is not at all acceptable. In order to arrest this rotation I used a small washer. The washer is bend on both sides with a hand plier. This is then inserted to the slit on the ring with the bolt so that it\u2019s tightly fix the PVC ring from rotating. Once all the bolts are inserted, it\u2019s tightened by the nuts with the help of hand pliers. The excess bolt length are cut off using a hack saw and the nuts are further secured with superglue. This finishes the male threaded socket. On the top we have a flat surface of the concealing section which encloses the grip ring and the top plunger section. On the bottom threaded side of the male socket we could see the extension from the top plunger section and this section is free to rotate within the male socket. The second part of the plunger is connected at this extension and it\u2019s discussed in the next session.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5T/4GJ3/JTT5LN3R/F5T4GJ3JTT5LN3R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGJ/PLD1/JTT5LNS4/FGJPLD1JTT5LNS4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD4/VCVO/JTT5LNSI/FD4VCVOJTT5LNSI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX2/M6HR/JTT5LNTD/FX2M6HRJTT5LNTD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F63/HH13/JTT5LOBH/F63HH13JTT5LOBH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F45/86ZN/JTT5LOPO/F4586ZNJTT5LOPO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB0/3PT3/JTT5LQ5U/FB03PT3JTT5LQ5U.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: The Male Threaded Socket"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "These two parts helps in the opening and closing of the tripod legs. To be specific, the transfer the up & down motion of the plunger to the legs. First let\u2019s discuss about the metal hook. We need three of these hooks, one for each leg. The metal rod that I have used has a thickness of 1.8mm and it\u2019s actually the spokes of an old umbrella. Since these already comes with a waterproof treatment, we have an added benefit of preventing corrosion in future. With the help of two pliers, the metal rod is bended to form the required dimension. All the hooks are identical and you could have a better idea about the dimensions by referring the picture.\nThe aluminium metal parts are made from cutting three equal pieces from aluminium heat sink. A hack saw is used for this purpose. Further, two holes are drilled at the ends of each pieces. The further process with these sections are explained in upcoming steps.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8P/3DTQ/JTT5LQS8/F8P3DTQJTT5LQS8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYA/G8YL/JTT5LR0O/FYAG8YLJTT5LR0O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVY/5CXU/JTT5LR5R/FVY5CXUJTT5LR5R.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: The Metal Hooks & Heat Sink Pieces"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "As discussed in the previous step, the plunger head is enclosed within the male socket and the plunger body would be the only visible part of the plunger setup. The extension the plunger head section is a 0.75 inch PVC pipe and in order to connect to it, the plunger body should be a 0.75 inch PVC coupler. However the length of a single coupler wasn\u2019t enough for the setup so I took a small 0.75 inch pipe and solvent fixed two coupler with it. This resulted in a longer section of approximate length of 8cm. This forms the basic structure and it\u2019s time to modify this structure.\nI hope you remember the aluminium hinges on the legs. So when the tripod legs are closed these hinges needs space to fit properly but unfortunately the 0.75 inch plunger passing through the centre of the tripod kills the space for the hinges and thus the legs can\u2019t be fully closed. So to tackle this problem, slits have been cut on the plunger body. There is no specific dimensions for the slit and it all depends on the dimension of the hinges that you have used for the legs. One thing to note is that the plunger body goes up while opening the legs which causes the swinging motion of the legs. So some extra room for the slits should be provided so that it don\u2019t get jammed by the hinges. Also don\u2019t cut the slit all the way up to the top portion and instead, leave some fully circular portion at the top of the plunger body, it\u2019s necessary for fixing the body on to the plunger head.\nNow it time to move on to the next stage. Here we need to provide the arrangements for attaching the hooks (mentioned before) on to the plunger body. In the video I\u2019m attaching the hooks just by cutting slits on the plunger body without any other measurements but actually there is more to the story.\nFirst thing to do is to cut some guide ways on the plunger body for the hooks. In order to get find the exact position of the hooks I followed a particular method. First insert the plunger body on the plunger head extending out from the male socket. The insert this setup into the female threaded socket. Tighten the thread fully so that the male socket is fully inserted. Now the three legs are fixed using the bolts inserted through the hole in the female socket. Have a look at the picture to get the idea of what I\u2019m talking about. Now the 3 metal hooks are inserted through the holes in the leg hinges. Once it\u2019s done then apply some acrylic paint on the other end of the hook and fold the legs so that the hooks touches the plunger body. This paint residue on the plunger gives us the exact position of the guide ways for the plunger. Repeat the process for all the three. Once it\u2019s done remove all parts and cut the guide ways on the plunger body. Since all the metal hook are hand bended each one differ a bit in their dimensions. So it\u2019s better to number the hooks so that we use the same exact hook on the same guide ways & legs in the final stage of assembly. Keep in mind that we are cutting a guide way and not a slit on the plunger. Which means do not cut full way through the plunger thickness and instead stop at a position where depth of cut could accommodate the thickness of the metal hook. Next step is to fix the aluminium heat sink pieces on top of this hook arrangement so that the hook could swing in the guide ways. Simply place the aluminium pieces over the guide ways and mark the position for the holes on the plunger body. Further, drill these marked holes and things are almost done. Now fix the plunger body to the 0.75 inch pipe extension of the plunger head in the male socket. Use a PVC solvent to permanently fix these parts. We\u2019ll attach the hook & the metal piece at the final stage of build.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FM0/W04L/JTT5LRGM/FM0W04LJTT5LRGM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT4/E8AQ/JTT5LRJB/FT4E8AQJTT5LRJB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F20/5LZP/JTT5LRT8/F205LZPJTT5LRT8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC0/YH2D/JTT5LRUX/FC0YH2DJTT5LRUX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM0/HHW6/JTT5LRWV/FM0HHW6JTT5LRWV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTR/H75O/JTT5LS7C/FTRH75OJTT5LS7C.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: The Plunger Body"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "It\u2019s made from three PVC pipes each having a diameter of 0.5 inch and a length of 15cm. These pipes are commonly used for PVC conduit electrical wirings and more importantly the black colour PVC provides a good aesthetic look to the extension poles. We need to cut a longitudinal slit on two of the pipes using hack saw. One Pipe with a 1cm slit and the other one with a 2cm. The idea is to reduce the diameter of the pipe so that one could fit inside the other. First take the 1cm slit pipe and start heating it from one end using a heat gun. Since we are not heating the pipe a lot, a cloth gloves is enough to protect hands. Don\u2019t heat the entire pipe all at once instead, heat some portion from one end and start rolling it with hand to a smaller dimension. Then heat the next portion and repeat the same up to a length of 10cm. This leaves us a 5cm unheated portion towards the other end. Similarly repeat this entire process to the 2cm slit PVC pipe. Since it has a larger slit, this pipe would be having a much lesser diameter than the previous pipe So that it could fit inside it.\nSo the extension poles will be having 3 PVC pipes arranged one inside the other. The inner pipe exerts force (in the form of friction) on the pipe around it and thus the pipe could be extended and retracted to any length within its limits. But how does the Pipe exerts force to the outer pipe to remain at a fixed position? Well, that\u2019s where the 5cm region comes into play. It helps in providing the necessary friction between the outer pipe of the extension pole setup. It is this friction which holds the extension pipes in place while we adjust the pole height. The other 10cm should be heated in such a way that it barely touches the outer pipe. The 5cm friction region allows a smooth extension and retraction of the PVC poles. However if the entire pipe (15cm) becomes the friction surface then, the force needed move the pipes would be much larger and using the selfie stick would become very inconvenient. That\u2019s the reason why we heated the pipes in such a way that only a 5cm portion comes in contact with the outer pipe. One thing to note is, overheating the pipe would result in warping of the section. So heat to a level where things haven\u2019t gone too far. At the beginning we have set aside a pipe without a slit and this would become the outermost extension pole. The other two pipes should fit inside this pipe to form the full extension pole setup.\nExpect the innermost pipe the other two were again modified. 4 or 5 slits have been cut with a scissors at the 5cm unheated end. This slits are then heated and folded with a hand lighter to form a closed side. We can\u2019t use a heat gun for this because it can\u2019t be focused to small areas and other parts would be also heated, deforming out extension pole. Now a small hole is drilled in the middle of this closed side. The final extension poles should not come off from each pipes and in order to prevent it, we are using plastic rope arrangement through the pipes to hold it in place. It is for this arrangement that we heated and folded on end of the pipe. More about this rope arrangement in next session.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAG/Z70P/JTT5LSCM/FAGZ70PJTT5LSCM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWC/TWDG/JTT5LSF6/FWCTWDGJTT5LSF6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0N/UYBI/JTT5LSHD/F0NUYBIJTT5LSHD.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: The Extension Poles for Selfie Stick"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "As the name suggests, it\u2019s made up of L clamps.

One flat side of the L clamp is drilled with drill bit of diameter 4.9mm and the other side with a drill bit of 7.9mm. The dimensions depends upon the bolts that you are using. Our aim is Place the two L clamps one on top of another to form a U shaped structure and insert the 6 inch long bolt through the hole. Tighten it in place using a nut. A thicker bolt would be inserted through the other side at a later stage of build.\nNow take a plastic rope of about 1m length. The one which I used have a thickness of 1.9mm. Now make a knot on one end and insert it through the innermost PVC extension pipe. Then insert the previous L clamp holder through the same pipe. The knot should be placed between the L clamp and top end of pipe. On the other end a small portion of the bolt would be exposed. If not then cut the PVC accordingly so that a small portion of the bolt (0.5mm) is exposed. Now insert a nut on this bolt so that the L clamp is fixed on the PVC pipe.

Cut a circular section of width 1.5cm from a 2 inch PVC coupler. I\u2019m using the coupler only for taking the advantage of its thickness (3.4mm) so that the part could be stronger. If you have a 2 inch PVC pipe with a good thickness (3mm or above) you could use that instead. Next, cut a slit on the circular portion using a hack saw. Then heat the part using a heat gun to form a j shaped structure. You can use some small plywood block to act pressure on the section during the forming process. Now we have done with the basic structure. As you have seen, the J stand should perform a swing motion on the L clamp stand. In order to do that I used the steel socket from the barrel bolt which is commonly used for door fittings. Drill a hole at the centre of the steel socket. This hole is necessary to fix the J stand to the L clamp stand. Now drill another hole on the bottom edge of the J shaped stand and fix the steel socket using a small bolt through that hole.

It\u2019s made with a 2inch PVC pipe with thicker wall (3mm or above). The length of the pipe should be around 10cm. The opposing phone grabbing hand like structure i.e. the phone mount is made from this PVC pipe. First mark a 2 cm point from one end of the PVC pipe. Make another 2cm mark on the other end of the PVC but on the opposite side. I.e. the marking on both ends should be 180 degrees apart. Now using a hack saw cut both these points until the cut reaches half way through the PVC. So now we basically got two opposing cuts on both the ends of the PVC pipe. Next, join these cuts along the length of the PVC pipe. This results in two equal sections as shown in the picture. These two forms the phone mount setup. This new section have a circular portion followed by a tail section. The sides of this tail region is further cut to form a width of 3cm. In order to properly hold the smartphone in place, a tapering cut should be made from the outer end towards the inner end. This tapering ensures a proper non slip contact between the mount and the smartphone. Now cut the centre part of the circular portion and using a heat gun this circular portion is straightened up. I have used small plywood pieces to apply pressure to the heated PVC sections. You\u2019ll get a better idea while watching the build video (minute 9.58). So we have straightened the circular portion on both the PVC sections. This Straightened section is where the phone gets fixed on the tripod. SO these two phone mount sections have to be attached to the J shaped stand and also it must have an elastic tension setup for properly holding the phone. To accomplish this one section is drilled with a hole of diameter 8mm and other with a slit of width 8mm. So when a bolt is inserted through both of the sections, one could slide over the other to form the phone mount setup. Now the only thing missing is the elastic arrangement. For it I have cut 3 strips of elastic, each having a length of 7.5cm. The length and no of elastic strip to use depends on your personal preference of how much tension you need between the phone mounts. Then two holes have been burned on both ends of the elastic with a hot soldering iron tip. Two small bolts are inserted through this holes at the two ends. However the white elastic would be visible on the outside of the tripod so it\u2019s better to conceal it. A simple solution is to use two pieces of glass fibre sheet or any other plastic sheet. One hole should be made on one end of both the pieces and cover it with the same vinyl sheet used before. Bolts are now inserted through it and then through the elastic.

The legs, the male & female threaded sockets, the L clamp holder, the J shaped stand and the phone mounts went through this process to reach its final form. This upholstery work includes gluing two set of layers on the parts. The inner layer is done with jute cloth and the last and outer layer is done with a vinyl sheet. The aim of the inner layer is to mask all the imperfections on the PVC and most importantly mask the bolts and nuts on different parts. The outer layer of vinyl sheet gives good aesthetic and more premium look for the parts. Let\u2019s see things in more detail. A piece of jute cloth is glued over the parts using synthetic rubber adhesive (contact cement). For the parts have a bolt fittings, the portion of cloth above the bolt is burned with the tip of a hot soldering iron which exposes the bolts. Now second layer of cloth is glued over it and the process of burning with the soldering iron is repeated. This is repeated until the jute layer thickness aligns with the bolt. After that a final layer of jute is glued over it which conceals the bolts. For my setup a total of 4 layers of cloth was need to perfectly cover all the bolts.

The technique used above would full fills this condition and hence I chose it.\nOne thing to note is that Jute cloth actually burns in a different fashion than the others cloths. It kind of melts and burns while using the soldering iron tip and for this reason it super easy to cut. It was this property of jute which made me to use it in this layering process. Once the cloth layer is done, all the excess edges are trimmed using a utility knife. After that it\u2019s time for the final layer of vinyl sheet.\nI have used black carbon fibre textured vinyl for the final layer. Though vinyl sheet comes with an adhesive at its back, it is too weak for a proper bonding with the cloth. So I again used the same synthetic rubber adhesive at its back to glue over the cloth. The process is repeated for all the parts. See the pictures of the parts which have under gone this upholstery transformation. Also the plunger body and the car clip are spray painted black. Now lets move on to the final assembly.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPM/NMZ4/JTT5LX77/FPMNMZ4JTT5LX77.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKK/OSQP/JTT5LX8C/FKKOSQPJTT5LX8C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKG/7K01/JTT5LX9T/FKG7K01JTT5LX9T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSV/RB5Q/JTT5LXBF/FSVRB5QJTT5LXBF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3N/WEQC/JTT5LXC7/F3NWEQCJTT5LXC7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX8/XAH3/JTT5LXD2/FX8XAH3JTT5LXD2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCH/TTYK/JTT5LXE4/FCHTTYKJTT5LXE4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ9/MSCC/JTT5LXE9/FQ9MSCCJTT5LXE9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ8/L1O0/JTT5LYOD/FJ8L1O0JTT5LYOD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7D/B4ES/JTT5LXJ4/F7DB4ESJTT5LXJ4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCR/P2V0/JTT5LYTC/FCRP2V0JTT5LYTC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0C/RLFO/JTT5LY0K/F0CRLFOJTT5LY0K.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 12: The Upholstery Work"}, {"step": 13, "steps_text": "So we are done with all the parts and all we need to do is to assemble everything in the right way.\nWe could begin with the male & female threaded socket. Insert the male socket by rotating and tightening the thread on the female socket. Now place the metal hook over the plunger guide ways. Placing the aluminium metal piece over the hook and securing it with the bolts. Proceed the same for all the three hooks.\nOnce the hooks are fixed, we could attach the legs in place. Insert the other end of the hook through the hole provided in the leg hinges. Now fix the leg hinges to the female socket by inserting a both through the hole provided on the female socket and the hinges. This process is repeated for all the three hooks. This finishes the Leg mechanism and now rotating the male socket the legs should fold and unfold to form the tripod.\nThe next step is to attach the extension pole for the selfie stick. Since the L clamp is already inserted and fixed with the innermost pipe it is now a part of the extension pole. Hope you remember the plastic rope extending from the L clamp pipe. This rope is now inserted through the next extension pipe. Fully draw the rope through the other end of the pipe and insert a small portion (2cm) of the innermost pipe through the second pipe. Remember that the other end of the second pipe is a closed end (slits have been heated and folded to form a close end in previous step). A knot is made at this end and it prevents the pipe from coming off. Now insert the last and outer most extension pipe through the tripod setup. Insert from the leg end side of the tripod. The grip ring inside the male threaded socket will hold this pipe in position.\nLike the previous process the rope is inserted through it a small portion of the second pie is inserted. Then a knot is made at the closed end of the third pipe. The excess rope length is cut off. This finishes the extension pole setup.\nNow let\u2019s attach the J shaped stand on to the L clamp setup. The bolt for attaching the J stand has a 2 holes. One along the thickness and one along centre of axis. This bolt is inserted through the L clamp and then through the J stand. A small bolt is inserted through the barrel socket hole and then through the hole in the main bolt. This fixes the J stand on the main bolt. Place the nut on the other end.\nNow we could attach the phone mount on the top hole on the J stand. Before fixing the phone mount, make sure that the elastic setup is installed and its bolts are secured with the nuts. Insert the main bolt through the hole on the J stand and fix it with a nut on the other side.\nThe car clip are the final part that is fixed. The U shaped metal rod fixed on the male socket could be now inserted through the slit on the car clip. Further a bolt is inserted through the hole which fixes the car clip to the tripod.\nThe two main bolts on the L clamp and the phone mount have another hole along the length. A screw and washer could be inserted into this holes to secure the nuts on to the bolts. Further all the exposed metallic parts could be painted black for better aesthetics.\nThe build is now complete. I hope you have liked my project.

During three years doing that work, I cleaned thousands of square feet of carpet and fabric. After developing professional skills in the trade, I've always opted to clean my carpet and furniture myself. Since leaving that job, a long time ago, I've relied on renting DIY equipment. While far less powerful than professional gear, Rug Doctor machines can produce adequate results for small spaces. Especially with the advantage of professional level knowledge of how to use them most effectively. Renting equipment occasionally, can be fairly economical and convenient. However, it's very common to have a need for spot cleaning more frequently than it's practical to rent a machine. Particularly in environments blessed with animal companions.\nI've wanted to have my own extraction cleaning equipment for some time. I finally decided to combine experience I gained working with plastics during my second job, with my knowledge of extraction cleaning tools, and put together my own rig. Follow along and put together a rig of your own, for less than the cost of 3 machine rentals.\nIn this article, I share step by step instructions of how to build an extraction cleaning hand tool.

First turn off the supply valve by rotating it clockwise snugly. If the valve or hose fitting is heavily corroded, or doesn't turn with moderate force, STOP and use one of the other connection options mentioned. It's common for valves that haven't been operated in a long time to leak a little. So it's good practice to place a bucket underneath the supply valve, before removing the supply hose, if possible. Now using groove joint pliers, loosen the fitting then unscrew the supply hose by rotating the hose fitting counter-clockwise. Lower the hose into the bucket. There will be some residual water in it. See Fig. 35 and Fig. 36.\nAlternatively a sink faucet adapter can be used to provide the hot water supply. These adapters will NOT fit all sink faucet spouts.\nUnwind the hand tool supply hose and stretch it out. Screw the hose spigot fitting onto the supply spigot by hand.
