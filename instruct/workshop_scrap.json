One of the fighters there is a young man who just moved into his first apartment and is sorely lacking in furniture. I have been looking for new projects and things to try so I offered to make him a nightstand for free(I need a new nightstand as well so this could be a trial run I thought haha). He happily accepted my offer. I sketched out 3 or 4 different designs and he choose the one he liked the most. I tried to use all scrap lumber I had left over from older projects in an effort to keep the costs down.\n\nThe Design:\nI mocked up a few different ideas while riding the bus to work one day but one of them really stuck with me. It was a modern style nightstand with one vertical pillar that everything is attached to (see picture of autodesk model). There would be two base legs and two arms that projected off the vertical pillar. Three shelves in total with one being on the bottom and the other two located on the top. I really want to get better at good joinery so I decided to use two modified bridle joints to attach the vertical column to the two horizontal legs. The arms and upper shelves would all be attached via a long tenon that I would eventually cut and put walnut splines into. It may seem intimidating but this is honestly a pretty straightforward build, with some decent chisels and handsaws just about any woodworker could easily accomplish this. Just take your time and enjoy the process.\nDisclosure: This post may contain Amazon affiliate links that earn me a small commission, at no additional cost to you.

They can make precise marks on almost any material. Cut through all different materials at different thicknesses. And engrave into most materials also.\nAs far as Subtractive Manufacturing goes Laser Cutting can be considered as important as CNC Milling. It may not be as versatile as CNC Milling or an Additive Manufacturing process like 3D Printing. But Laser cutting is so precise that for a Subtractive Manufacturing tool it hardly creates any waste or scrap material unlike CNC Milling and is much faster than Additive Manufacturing processes like 3D Printing.\nOne thing I know for sure, is that when you first get a laser cutter, or start working with one it can be difficult if you don't have someone to help you. I just recently got what is known as a \"Cheap Chinese Laser\" it is specifically a 50W Orion Motor Tech Laser Cutter that can be purchased from Amazon or even Walmart. I did tons of research from about 15 different sources so I was prepared with getting my laser and I still ran into some hiccups.\nI hope this helps people that are having troubles with their laser cutter, or helps people who are considering purchasing one make up their mind. I will be covering the different kinds of lasers and why you may or may not buy a certain one. The problems that come with each (focusing primarily on the type I got). The primary components of Laser Cutters.

Always ALWAYS research what kind of laser cutter/engraver you have so you know the proper safety equipment to get.\nThis can include safety glasses, a fire extinguisher, and higher quality lasers require water cooling systems and gas assist that require a water chiller and air compressor.\nMake sure to use GFCI outlets. Surge protectors. Proper rated safety goggles (what works for a blue or green diode laser might not work for one that uses infrared light). Keep a fire extinguisher handy. Research the best accessories for your machine, too low or too high quality may damage your laser (like your water chiller and air compressor, lenses, mirrors, laser tubes and so on).

They usually use Blue Diodes that run at about 445 - 450nm (1.6W - 4.5W) or Red Diodes that run at about 200mW - 300mW or 700mW. The Red Diodes are cheaper and weaker than the Blue diodes. Diodes do not use mirrors or lenses and therefore are rather weak compared to the other two laser cutter types. They are primarily used for engraving and marking items more than cutting but they are still able to cut with multiple passes.Usually used for paper and thin organic material.\n\nFiber Lasers use a optical fiber and use a rare earth medium like neodymium, thulium, erbium, ytterbium, dysprosium, praseodymium, or holmium to make the laser more powerful. Fiber lasers are incredibly expensive (the MOST expensive) but require much less maintenance and are much more durable and efficient with its power usage. They can be used for cutting, marking, welding, engraving, cleaning and more. Fiber lasers are the only laser described here that are able to do extensive work with metal, including cutting metal.\n\nCO2Lasers are some of the most commonly bought lasers on the market. Their lasers are created inside of gas filled glass tubes when a large electrical pulse is sent through the tube and excites the molecules into a intense beam of infrared light. These lasers come in a large range of wattage, anywhere from 30W to120W, where the lower wattage is best for engraving and the higher ranges are better for cutting. These lasers require a water or air cooling system to keep the tube from over heating. Once the beam is emitted from the tube it is bounced across three mirrors and shot through a focusing lens before it marks/cuts the material. Because of the use of mirrors, lens and higher power, gas assist is highly recommended to extend life of accessories. They can be used to mark, engrave or cut through most materials excluding metal,\nThere are three different types of CO2 Laser Cutter companies, American made, Chinese Imported/American Audited, and Chinese Lasers. Each have their pros and cons.\nAmerican Made Laser Cutters are usually high quality machines that cut and engrave faster. The manuals come in english, everything works out of the box, software is reliable and easier to use, and there is a great support to be had by both the manufacturers and community. The main problem is going to be the size of the laser and the costs. The cheapest \"decent\" laser cutter will be around $4000. A truly reliable and good quality laser cutter will cost you $8000 and up. That will just be for the laser cutter itself, you must also take into consideration how much water chillers for the cooling system will cost, air compressors for the gas assist and new laser tubes for when the old ones die and the cost to have someone come install it. All these accessories will be much more expensive because they are american made. Companies include Glowforge and Full Spectrum Laser (lower quality), Epilog Lasers, Trotec Lasers and Kern Lasers (VERY HIGH QUALITY)\nChinese Imported/American Audited Laser Cutters are Chinese knock-offs that have had parts replaced and the entire system has been checked by american companies. This can include making sure the laser tube and power supply are up to par and working right. That the gantry is in line properly, mirrors are good, servo controller is good, software is not faulty, and everything is safe. Along with this you get warranties on parts and the same customer service you would get with an American Made Laser Cutter. Which means if you have any problems you can ask the company or community about it and get it solved quicker and easier. Lasers like these are not as expensive as American Made Lasers but they are not cheap by any means and usually run about $3500 - $8000. Accessories are cheaper though because you don't need as high quality pieces and can install them yourself most the time. Companies include Universal Lasers, Rabbit Lasers, and Boss Lasers, G.Weike. Each company is good quality but different people have their own preferences.\nChinese Lasers are just what the name implies, laser cutters made by chinese companies and sold in the US or imported to the US. Like most things from China, these lasers are subpar at best. Much of the time the lasers are just put together at the bare minimum, sometimes screws aren't tightened all the way. Tubes are broken during shipping or are sold as a stronger tube than they are. Power supplies are defective. Gantries are not properly square. Mirrors are broken or physically can not be aligned properly. The controllers are not compatible with most software or are defective. Instructions and program are not in English occasionally. These are all problems that COULD happen, not that WILL happen. A lot of the time, if you do your research, you will still get a good machine that can do the same work as the other two types, just slower and with a bit more work put into it. Effectively, Chinese Lasers are for tinkerers. You will not be able to get any useful support from the manufacturer but there is a HUGE community for chinese lasers. All you have to look up is K40 lasers, or K50 lasers, which are references to the \"40W\" and \"50W\" laser tubes that the most commonly owned laser cutters use. With that you will find tons of forums, discussions, videos and tutorials about your laser, or at least a laser similar to yours. As far as companies and branding goes, many of the chinese lasers are just referred to as \"White and Blue\" \"Red and White\" Lasers and so on. In reality they are all the EXACT same laser, with small differences the company might have made to them, maybe they put in a different controller, or you have a motorized bed, or the power supply is of better quality. Either way most people get their lasers of off Ebay (unreliable cause of so many options) Amazon (Little better Quality) Walmart (almost good quality because they offer warranties) and a number of other websites, but these are the main ones. My laser is available on both Amazon and Walmart, it is the Orion Motor Tech laser, the Dark Grey and Blue one that is 50W. As I was assuming, it actually had a 40 Watt laser tube in it instead of a 50 Watt, but the reason I still purchased it was because it had everything ELSE for a 60 Watt laser!!! All that needs to be done is open up a bracket and install the tube when the initial one dies. I bought it from Walmart and I'd say it is a reliable way to go. Cost for a K40 is usually around $400 while the higher quality one i got was more around $1500. The tubes will be much more cheaper, the pumps and air compressors usually come with the machine (mine did) and it leaves room for adding and upgrading your system.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 3: Which Laser Cutter Is Right for YOU?"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "From lots of research online I decided I would purchase from Walmart, its a large company, has warranties, others had purchased from there and I actually had a discount from there (I didn't even have to pay tax, possibly cause it was imported already). Next best bet would be Amazon. The machine I got was the 50W (really a true 40W) Orion Motor Tech Laser Cutter the Dark Grey one not the White one that goes for about $1400. The shipping and handling says it will weigh around 300 pounds, it will require a specialized moving company that will be provided already during the purchase and will be delivered in a large wooden box. The shipping company will call a few days after purchase and you will be able to set a date and time for them to drop it off and maybe even move it into your place.\nWHEN YOU RECEIVE IT!!!! You have the right to keep the shipping company there while you open up the box and look at what you purchased. First thing you must do is bust open the back and front end of the box so that you can open up the front of your laser cutter. There will be a \"key\" hanging from inside the laser cutter, use it to unlock and open up the back of your laser cutter to see if the CO2 Laser Tube is intact. The Laser Tube is the most fragile object in your laser cutter and you want to make sure it is not broken. If it is MAKE SURE to get a CLAIM NUMBER because this is what you will use to get a new laser tube instead of having to buy one yourself out of pocket. Once you see everything is fine you can give clearance for the shipping company to go.\nAt this point the box is already broken open and you see that there is a vent, a bag, and a rotary attachment and under the table will be a air compressor and water pump. In the bag you will find a power cord for the laser cutter, silicon adhesive (used for the laser tube), Ethernet cable, white tape, USB cable, CD, Manual, Allen Wrenches. The power cord is similar to a computer cord and will plugged into the right side of the machine. The silicon adhesive will be used when you change out the tubes, it is the insulator that attaches the wires to your tube. The Ethernet cable I believe is for connecting your computer to the machine, as is the USB cable. As for the CD and Manual I haven't hardly glanced at them. Lastly the Allen Wrenches are good for the hardware on the machine. The rotary attachment is used for engraving on round objects and will be used at a later date.\nIt is recommended that you get some help moving this, after taking everything apart it is really only about 150 pounds but it is large and bulky and incredibly difficult lifting up three flights of stairs, believe me I should know.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJD/JXS7/JTT5IAF0/FJDJXS7JTT5IAF0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHW/9RC8/JTT5IAFW/FHW9RC8JTT5IAFW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU1/ZHI7/JTT5IAQY/FU1ZHI7JTT5IAQY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXC/I7W6/JTT5IAK3/FXCI7W6JTT5IAK3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKV/HJ9N/JTT5IAMN/FKVHJ9NJTT5IAMN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY5/2TKU/JTT5IAP8/FY52TKUJTT5IAP8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1S/UB8S/JTT5IANJ/F1SUB8SJTT5IANJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQL/RTKY/JTT5IAU2/FQLRTKYJTT5IAU2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F69/QOL1/JTT5IAYJ/F69QOL1JTT5IAYJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5K/N35K/JTT5IB0A/F5KN35KJTT5IB0A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPZ/EFWB/JTT5IB3P/FPZEFWBJTT5IB3P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDU/OQ15/JTT5IB82/FDUOQ15JTT5IB82.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIH/3VCW/JTT5IBCS/FIH3VCWJTT5IBCS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0O/2T5D/JTT5IBGV/F0O2T5DJTT5IBGV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIC/P8ZP/JTT5IBIM/FICP8ZPJTT5IBIM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHI/F99Y/JTT5IBM1/FHIF99YJTT5IBM1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0M/09W1/JTT5IBPJ/F0M09W1JTT5IBPJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2T/9WUI/JTT5IBSB/F2T9WUIJTT5IBSB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVB/198T/JTT5IBXH/FVB198TJTT5IBXH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNR/T2T4/JTT5IC0Z/FNRT2T4JTT5IC0Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRM/3K5A/JTT5IC81/FRM3K5AJTT5IC81.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F93/NF0Z/JTT5ICMA/F93NF0ZJTT5ICMA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCX/XK1Q/JTT5ICO4/FCXXK1QJTT5ICO4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXT/0E76/JTT5I9D8/FXT0E76JTT5I9D8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F87/CN53/JTT5I9TI/F87CN53JTT5I9TI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Buying, Shipping and Unboxing"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "When cutting materials laser cutters will often emit rather bad smelling smoke and occasionally harmful vapors. Because of this it is important to install your laser cutter nearby a window where the vent tube that comes out the back of your laser will be able to expel those vapors out of your house. I personally have my vent attached to the outlet for a clothes dryer and it works perfectly.\nIf you have a room that has access to multiple outlets this will also help because laser cutters have extra accessories that also need to be plugged in. The laser cutter itself has outlets that you can plug these accessories into. From the research I did I learned the outlets on the Laser Cutter are not always reliable, so I instead attached a surge protector outlet splitter to the outlet in my closet and plugged everything up to it. If possible make sure to use a GFCI outlet and a surge protector to protect from water shorts and power surges.\nThe accessories you will need will be the Water Pump/Water Chiller for cooling your CO2 laser tube and the Air Compressor for keep your optics clean. (Both were provided with this package that I bought). There is also a tutorial for making an Isobox for your air compressor included in this Instructable, it will require an outlet too.

You do not have to use Lightburn, it is just what I started out using.\nTo begin, you make a design, using any kind of Cad Software (Fusion 360, Solidworks, AutoCAD, etc) save it as a PDF (like I do) or any of the other five or so compatible files and open it in Lightburn. Once it is opened you have the option to click and drag the design to any place on your machines work area, change the size, add a few simple touches and more. Once you have it placed you can fine tune the settings of what your going to do, like adjust the speed and strength of the laser for either cutting, scanning or cut+scan or optimize the path the head will traverse. Once done, attach the USB to the machine and click the frame button. This has the laser head go around whatever you are going to mark/cut so you can make sure the work piece is in the proper place. Hitting START will set the laser head along the path to be cut, even if you do not have the Laser Tube turned on, it will still go along this path.

A main focus for laser cutting tests is to find the FOCAL POINT. The perfect distance that optimally Cuts/Marks your material. Because if the FOCAL POINT is too HIGH then the laser is losing power and will make the Cut/Mark too large and ugly. If the FOCAL POINT is too LOW then you may accidentally cut into the piece, or if your intention IS to cut through the piece, the beam is too strong and will burn the edges of the work piece as the laser goes through. This may not just be any one point either, because you will have different materials that are different shapes, sizes, and consistencies, the FOCAL POINT may vary slightly.\nWhen cutting occasionally you want the FOCAL POINT BELOW the top of the work piece. Because when cutting you are actually carving out an hourglass like shape in the material. Having the focal point just below the work means that you are using the strength and kerf of the laser efficiently. When engraving you usually want the FOCAL POINT EXACTLY ON the work pieces surface so have a nice clean edge.\nTo find the EXACT FOCAL POINT you can do what is called a slant test. All focal lenses tell you what their focal distance \"should be\" usually 1in, 2in, or 4in, there are more but these are you main ones. So figure out which lens you have so you can ballpark how far your piece should go down for the test cause it's not exact.\nNow you get a piece of you material and you put something under one end of it and put it at a very gradual angle hence the name of \"slant test\".\nIn your program make a box or a line that goes along the slant and run the program, make sure you are wearing your safety equipment and the housing is closed!\nAs the laser moves across the material the laser burns should start of thick and ugly and burn up the material, but as is approaches the FOCAL POINT the laser burns will get thinner and finer unitl it passes the focal point and gets ugly again.\nThere will be a point were the mark is the cleanest and finest, that is the right distance for the FOCAL POINT.\nMeasure the distance from the bottom of your Laser Cutter head and that point and that is the \"PERFECT DISTANCE\" and you want to remember that distance cause the rest of your tests are based off that.\nAlways do this simple test when working with a new material, just to be sure.\nYou now have the \"PERFECT\" FOCAL POINT DISTANCE so set your material to that distance and prepare for the test to find the optimum SPEED, POWER and DISTANCE. Didn't we just find distance? Yes but for cutting, engraving and marking each needs a slightly different distance to work optimally.\nSince we already found the distance that makes a nice fine line we will start with LASER MARKING.\nYou can look online for a Material Test Code Image or you can design your own.\nTo make your own you will need to keep record of your SPEED, POWER, DISTANCE, FOCAL LENS, MATERIAL+MATERIAL THICKNESS, and # OF PASSES.\nDesign it so that it showcases at least ten different shades of marking starting with none, to a nice crisp black like shown in the color wheel in the picture or squares in line with each other so you can clearly see where one ends the next begins.\nPut the same line of text in different fonts and different sizes to see how they are affected by the tests.\nTest at different POWERS with the same SPEED, then change the SPEED and test different POWERS and repeat.\nThen test at a different FOCAL DISTANCE and repeat Step 6.\nOnly stop when you feel your machine is capable of using ONE setting to make nice crisp edges with good contrasting shades\nSpeed is often a big issue with marking, because to fast it wont mark, and too slow it will burn. Experiment with masking/painters tape covering the work. Once you peel it off it can get rid of scorching around the work. A 1in lens is good for this application because of its tightened focus.\nFor ENGRAVING it is best to start out at the \"PERFECT\" FOCAL POINT DISTANCE\nRepeat steps 2 - 8 but with the Cut and Mark option selected in your software.\nThis will turn those marks into engraving.\nThe darker the shade will translate to a deeper engraving of the material.\nWith different materials you can only engrave so much before it does not look good anymore. Engraving on acrylic will take a number of tries before it looks good. Beware working with mirrors because your engraving will also be reflected (really just stay away from them, they suck). For larger vectors, defocus your laser. The tape trick will also work here. A 2in lens works very well for engraving.\nFor LASER CUTTING you dont need all the extra shading stuff. You will primarily be focusing on cutting out squares to make sure you get a good finish on both sides and the cut is to dimension on The inside and out.\nConsider making a design similar to a ruler. where each measurement nick is actually a rectangle that must be cut out.\nCut out circles also to be able to make sure it can cut during turns.\nCut out triangles with different angle sizes to make sure the corners dont catch on the work piece.\nRepeat steps 6 - 8 except with cutting a clean, square piece that is the proper measurement and not burned around the edges.\nAdding tape to both sides of your work piece is great for this action. Depending on the material (woods) there may be residue left after the cut around edges that the tape will fix. Don't be scared to make multiple passes to get through a piece of work. However, more passes will not make as clean a cut, so know your limits. When cutting there is a kerf, make sure to account for this and diagnose how much deviation there is on the inside of the cut and outside of the cut when testing. A 4in lens is good for cutting because of the extended focus.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FO2/QP96/JTYN6T31/FO2QP96JTYN6T31.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ2/ETNE/JTYN7NG0/FQ2ETNEJTYN7NG0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Tests"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Take a look at the Aligning the Laser Cutter Mirrors in case you haven't already.

It turns out that making a hologram - a two dimensional image that appears to be a three-dimensional object - can be created using a scribing compass and a piece of plastic. These handmade three dimensional images are called scratch holograms.\nScratch holograms are created when there is a thin scratch across a flat surface. As you change your angle of viewing, point sources of light (like the Sun on a clear day) reflect off a single part of the curve. By changing your angle of perspective, this reflective point shifts along the curve. When you put a large number of these scratches together, you can create a three-dimensional image that can be viewed in reflected light.\nThere are a number of great Instructables on this site and elsewhere about how to make Scratch holograms by hand:\nhttps://www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-Tool-to-Dr...\nhttps://www.instructables.com/id/Scratch-Hologram-...\nhttp://amasci.com/amateur/holohint.html\nIf you want to understand the science of these images, there is a really nice paper by William Beaty in the SPIE Proceedings of Electronic Imaging on why this works.\nhttp://amasci.com/amateur/hand1.html\nThe problem with making Scratch Holograms is the effort required to create them. You have to make a series of concentric scratches by hand to make the reflective pattern match an object. Every point in the image has to have a corresponding scratched arc. Automating these scratches is tricky. For reasons we will discuss in the next section, you can't make these with a standard CNC machine or a laser etcher. It turns out, you have to build a special kind of tool.\nIn this project, I will show you how to make modify a CNC machine to make the kind of scratches needed to make complex scratch holograms automagically! Even if you aren't interested in making scratch holograms, this project will show you how you can add additional tools onto your CNC machine. It will take you through the physical design of the system, the electronics needed to create the scratch after it is triggered, the interface to the CNC controller, and the generation of the G-Code needed to run the machine. Of course, you are free to modify these codes for your own projects to work your own specialized tools.", "title": "The Scribe-bot: a Machine to Create Scratch Holograms", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Scribe-bot-a-Machine-to-Create-Scratch-Hologra/", "section": "workshop", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "When I first discovered that you could make scratch holograms, I grabbed a piece of plastic from my shop and a scribing compass to create one. I was mostly happy with the result, but it was SO tedious to create the image. I made scratch after scratch after scratch just to make a simple pattern. The final layout wasn't quite as uniform as I would like, and it took a long time to finish. I quickly realized I wanted to automatic this process. Naturally, I looked around my shop and around the local Maker Space to see if I could use an existing machine to do the work for me.\nThe most obvious tool to create scratch holograms was the laser etcher. You can make very fine laser etched lines in acrylic with almost no effort at all using a laser cutter. I quickly wrote up some a little python script to position the centers of the arcs and then generate arcs for simple letters. I brought the resulting eps file to my Make Space, and etched the pattern onto a piece of acrylic. The results were a bit surprising. The picture above shows the result. Basically, I found that there were two problems:\nLasers vaporize plastic. Obviously the laser etching process leaves behind a white line, not a clean reflective scratch. This white residual works beautifully for creating patterns on etched acrylic, but doesn't give the result we need for a scratch hologram. Initially I thought the white etched area would be easy to clean up if I used the right power levels, frequency, and speed. However no settings I tried produced a clean line using the laser etcher. I then thought perhaps this problem could be fixed by some kind of post processing, so I tried several cleaning processes on the etched plastic. None of them fixed the lines. Finally, I attempted to use a heat gun to gently re-melt the acrylic to make the white areas clear again. That process also failed. Lasers just don't the right kind of reflective line.\nLasers and CNC machines don't produce smooth circles. Because these lasers and CNC machines are driven by stepper motors, creating a truely continuous curve is impossible. There are always discrete jumps in any curve line cause by pixelation. Usually when you make 300dpi or 600 dpi images, these jumps are so small they you can't see them. However even at 600 dpi, the pixels easily show up when we reflect light on the edge of these curves. The very optical effect you need for creating these holograms shows how uneven these circles are. Instead of right reflecting off of a single point along a circle, light reflects across of a much larger region. This effectively spreads out the reflection which prevents you from seeing the hologram.\nAlthough a CNC machine with a stylus wouldn't have the same problems with vaporizing plastic as a laser, the pixelation in the circles caused by the steppers would still cause problems for creating the types of reflections we need to make the holograms work. Because we can't use XY stepper motors to create the arcs needed for scratch holograms, I realized that we have to create a new kind of machine that will make smooth arcs. That's the motivation behind this project and this new tool.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUI/8H8Z/JTWS1PIR/FUI8H8ZJTWS1PIR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Why Not Just Use a Laser Cutter or a Normal CNC Machine?"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Overall, this machine has two basic parts:\nA servo driven compass with a metal scribe on the end to etch a continuous arc on plastic.'\nA standard CNC machine that positions the center if the compass to create the arcs for the hologram.\nThe CNC I used in the project was an X-carve.

Use four M4 bolts and nuts to lock the arm in place. Reconnect the arm to the servo.\nMount the servo into the router mount piece. Make sure to thread the cables through the top of the mount.

I used a bolt cutters to trim the needle, but a Dremel, hacksaw, or even a hefty pair of wire cutters should work fine. Once the needle is cut to length, insert it into the scriber-stylus-holder using a pair of pliers. You may need to widen the hole a bit with drill. Make sure the needle fits securely into the holder. You can use glue if you like, but I found the friction fit was strong enough to hold it securely. The two version of this part are included to help you experiment with the project. V1 has a 30 degree angle and allows for a full-range adjustment of the arc being scribed. V2 has a 45 degree angle making the downward pressure from the needle stronger resulting in deeper scratches.

Basically, there is only one digital input. When this input goes high, the servo sweeps from its starting position clockwise to its final position. When the input goes back to the low state, the sweep reverse back to the starting position.\nTo assemble the system, I used a mini-prototype board that was connected to an Arduino Uno R3. I found the plans for this holder on Thing-A-Verse. (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2295626). A circuit board and permanent Arduino shield would be better, but this project was a designed to be a prototype. This should also be put in a box to protect the electrical connections.\nThe input to the circuit is taken from the M8 \"flood\" output of the CNC controller. This input section of the circuit is fed through a 4N35 optocoupler through a resistor to prevent any possible electrical feedback between the CNC controller. This may not be strictly necessary, but I wanted to make sure the controller is protected and isolated from the servo and the external power supplies. I put a Green LED and a resistor in parallel to the 4N35 so I could see when the controller goes between the high and low states.\nThe Arduino sketch converts the state the pulses that control the servo. When the input goes high, there is a 7ms delay for each degree of travel the servo travels to regulate the sweep speed. The sketch for the project is included above. You can easily modify the sweep angles and the sweep rate by modified the constants defined at the top of the sketch.\nThere are two power supplies needed to make this all work. First, you need to power the Arduino itself. I did this with a simple 5 volt USB recharger and USB cord. A second 5 volt power supply is needed to power the servo. Make sure that there is enough amperage to power the servo. The high torque servos can draw 3 amps of power.\nThe final step for the electronics is to connect it to the M8 connector on the CNC controller. Since this trigger is a low amperage connection, I used a 20 gauge wire two lead wire I had lying around the shop. Make sure to verify that the wires are fed into the optocoupler before you connect hook up any powers supplies or turn anything on.

When you look at the hologram, you see these dots being reflected in the arcs.\nYou can do the layout of the dots by hand, but it is a bit time-consuming. For the example hologram in this project, there were 159 dots. You can see the layout in the picture above. I decided to write a python script to take simple strings and turn them into a dot pattern for making holograms. Basically the script takes a string and converts them into vector graphics using the old style Hershey fonts. From these vectors, we the code then sample dot locations from along these curves.\nTo access this code, download the makedots_code.tgz file from above and unpack it. (This is a gzipped tar file from a Mac, but it should work fine in Linux or even in Windows.). Go into the directory that was created during the unpacking and edit the makedots.py code. You can change the string from the default \"MTSU\" to something else. I would suggest keeping this simple until you have some experience using the machine. You can also alter the size of the layout. There are some instructions in the code showing how this works.\nI've include the full set of Hershey fonts and a code to read them. The Hershey code was developed using a lot of on-line resources and example codes, so I am not claiming authorship of this code or the associated data files. They were distributed without a license, so feel free to use them in your projects.\nMy Python code only works for strings, but it would be fairly easy to write a code that does this for any vector graphics file. I thought about adding this, but I wanted to get this project out so other people could play with it.\nJust for testing purposes, you can completely bypass this step and use the sample \"mtsudots.txt\" file above. It is just a collection of x-y pairs that are used for the next step. As I mentioned, any data file with x-y pairs will do.\nMaking the G-code is also pretty easy. You just need to run the makegcode.py file with the dots text file as an input. There are more detailed instructions listed as comments in the code. Basically the code just generates a simple set of moves for each point in the dots file. For each point, the code:\n1) Moves to the x-y position above the center of the dot.\n2) Lowers the stylus to the plastic.\n3) Triggers the servo to sweep clockwise using the \"M8\" mist command.\n4) Pauses for 1.5 seconds to let the servo continue its sweep.\n5) Lifts the scriber up from the plastic.\n6) Clears the \"M8\" mist command, triggering the servo to return to its starting position.\n7) Pauses for 1.5 seconds to give the servo time to sweep back to its default position.\nThis is an example of the G-code pattern that is repeated in the code.\nG1 X0.0000 Y1.0081 F45.0\nG1 Z-0.2500 F9.0\nM8\nG4 P1.5000\nG1 Z0.2500 F9.0\nM9\nG4 P1.5000\nEverything in this code snippet repeats over and over again for each dot. The only change is the X and Y position associated with each dot.\nThe delays programmed into the G-code currently set to be 1.5 seconds. This is a bit longer than required, but it seemed prudent to be conservative in the beta version of the code. There is also a startup and finalize section of the code that followed examples I found for the X-carve. You might need to modify these for other CNC machines, but it seems the code seems to be fairly generic.\nTo get started, you can view an example G-code used to produce the MTSU hologram above.

I used the Easel software from Inventables for this to send the commands to my machine, but the steps should be about the same for any kind of g-code sending software.\nMaking sure your router is disabled, make sure you have taken the router bit out of the router. The power should be off and the cord detached from the wall.\nSet up a new project in Easel and then loading the G-code file from the disk.\nClamp a piece of acrylic down on your board. Make sure it is tightly secured and larger than the pattern you are going to be making. For the example in this Instructable, I used 0.093 inch thick acrylic I bought at the local Home Depot. I purchased an 18x24 inch piece for about $12, and then cut a smaller 6-inch by 18-inch piece off using my table saw. You should remove the protective material from the side you are going to be scribing on before you tighten the clamps attaching the acrylic to the waste board.\nOnce the acrylic is attached, click on the \"Carve\" button in the upper right of the Easel window.\nThe Easel system will tell you the dangers of using someone else's G-code. Honestly, you should take this warning seriously. This is experimental software, so please make sure to monitor the operation all the way through the creation of the hologram.

Instead, choose \"Manual\".\nUsing the position arrows on the right hand side of the screen, move the scribe position to the lower left area in your material. Once it has the correct x-y position, lower the scribe to the plastic. I use a note card to help me estimate the position of the scribe when it gets close. You can tell when the scribe is getting close to the surface by feeling when it grabs the cardboard. You will need to bring the scribe even lower so it will scrape into the plastic. You aren't zeroing it to touch the top of the material for this G-code, but rather to bite into the plastic. Honestly, this setting takes a little getting used to. I tend to use the 0.01 inch settings to step downward to the plastic to get a good fit. If you go too far down, the servo motor won't have enough torque to move the scribe. If you are too high, you won't make a deep enough scratch in the plastic. You have to experiment with this a bit. However - for your first time running the machine, I strongly recommend you keep the scribe well above the plastic and do an \"air carve\". It will allow you to follow the motions of the machine, check the limits of the plastic, and make sure everything is working before you do a full carve.\nOnce you have set the initial X, Y and Z position, click that you have homed the machine.\nIn the file screen, you need to click \"raise the bit\" to put the CNC in it's starting position.\nSkip the step of attaching and using the dust collection system.\nMAKE SURE THE ROUTER IS COMPLETELY UNPLUGGED, TURNED OFF, AND DISCONNECTED - then click that you have turned on the spindle.

The Sun is ideal, but a bright light bulb on the far side of the room would work fairly well.\nFirst, remove the protective plastic on the back of the acrylic and tape a piece of black paper to the backside. This isn't strictly necessary, but it will help you see the pattern from the reflections more clearly.\nPlace the plastic sheet down on a flat surface, and the adjust your position you use see light reflecting from the scratches in the plastic. You do NOT want to see the sunlight reflecting directly off of the acrylic, just sunlight reflecting from the thin scratches. OBVIOUSLY - DON'T STARE AT THE SUN OR ITS DIRECT REFLECTION! IT WILL BLIND YOU! Light reflecting from the tiny scratches should be fine, so just reposition yourself to avoid the direct reflection of sunlight from the acrylic.\nAs you move your head back and forth above the scratches, you should see the letter patterns shifting across the arcs. The video above can help you see this. Basically, you are viewing these letters from different angles because of the way the reflection are mapped on these arcs. There isn't a single angle that makes this work. You should be able to see the reflections from many different angles.\nYou can also view the same effect using the acrylic as a transmission hologram. You let the light go through the acrylic, and watch the light reflecting from the back side of the scratches.\nOnce you have successfully created your first hologram, you can start experimenting to improve the machine. If you change the arc radius of the scratches, you change the apparent depth of the letters you see in the reflection. This can be easily done by mechanically moving the scriber needle further from the servo. You can also change the angular extent of the arc (by modifying the Arduino program), you can see it from different angles. You can also create software to generate other kinds of point patterns.\nUltimately it would be really cool to have the both the scribe radius and scribes angular extent controlled by the software. By doing these modifications and adding some software to generate the G-code, you could create true three dimensional objects and overlays that appear and disappear as you change your viewing angle. Making these modifications will be a bit difficult to do when your CNC controller has only two-bits of control lines (M8 \"mist\" and M9 \"flood\"), but it might be possible with some clever programming.\nPlease let me know what you come up with!

The iron in the stain reacts with the tannins in the wood, darkening the pieces to a nice dark black or gray color. Cherry gave an excellent, dark black color, what I was looking for. The birch came out more gray, but may find applications in other projects someday.\nAfterwards, I cut a 45 degree angle on the pieces with a speed square as a template, and glued them onto the lid, securing with tape and a clamp set up.\nTIP: If you accidentally sand through to raw wood underneath the black stain, it's okay to use a tiny dot of black acrylic paint to cover your mistake!

Wrap the power supply and SSR in electrical tape, making sure to leave any holes and other necessary section uncovered. This is so that none of the wires or metal can make contact once sealed in the case. Even though I didn't do this, it might also be a good idea to isolate the arduino board.\nConnect all wires as shown in the fritzing diagram. Make sure that any of the wires that carry 120V for the outlet and oven are using heavy duty wire so as to handle the high current load of the oven. The outlet is installed in the larger side of the case and the IEC jack is installed on the cover of the box. To secure the Arduino and board insert the printed buttons into place, and then hot glue the board inside of the case on top. Make sure that the hot glue does not interfere with the buttons. Close the box by screwing the side panel on and then super gluing the cover's pegs into place.\nTo attach the thermistor to the oven insert it through the side of the door. With the particular oven I used there is about 3mm of clearance between the door and the main body, which was more than enough to insert the thermistor through. Wrap the end of the thermistor with kapton tape so that the metal of the oven will not interfere with the wiring and the readings. Attach it to the side of the oven using kapton tape. Use plenty to ensure that the thermistor will not fall off.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWX/ZDZS/JTYNA4BO/FWXZDZSJTYNA4BO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ0/J9FG/JTYNCOWI/FZ0J9FGJTYNCOWI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJL/M5XE/JTYNA45G/FJLM5XEJTYNA45G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMZ/R5H2/JTYN4D47/FMZR5H2JTYN4D47.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAH/5449/JTYNBKDP/FAH5449JTYNBKDP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Final Assembly"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "To use the oven, plug everything in and then turn it on. It will display a splash screen to let you know that the Arduino is turned on and working. To switch between always on mode and timed mode use the rotary switch. When the switch is in its on position it will be in Always On mode, and when off it will be in timed mode. When in timed mode, to start heating press the select button (the middle one) to go to the temperature selection menu. Using the up and down buttons change the temperature values and the left and right buttons switch the cursor between the hundreds, tens, and one value. Once you have selected your desired temperature press the select button to start heating the oven. It will take some trial and error to find the exact temperature that your particular solder melts at, also accounting for any error in the thermistor's calibration. For me my sweet spot temperature is around 215-220 C (measured with the Arduino). Once it hits the set temperature it shuts the oven off and starts the cool down procedure. The cool down procedure is letting the oven cool down to 50 degrees C so that when you take the boards out of the oven the solder isn't still hot and liquid with parts shifting around. When letting the oven cool down, leave the door shut as you don't want to damage the boards with any sudden changes in temperature. You need to let them cool off gradually. Once the oven has reached around 50 C it is safe to remove the boards and finish work on them.\nIf there is a problem during use shut the box and oven off immediately by hitting the emergency stop and pulling the plug. I have included both the indicator light and emergency stop as a safety precaution since the amount of power going through the relay to power the toaster oven is significantly more than I normally work with. Never leave this unattended when plugged in and running as it has serious potential to start a fire.

I clamped the stem 3 times in different spots and did 3 small bends for a smooth sweep.\n-Once the stem has been bent to the angle needed mount to the saw. Thread one nut up the stem approximately 3/8\" so that there is enough thread protruding to go through the saw and install a second nut to clamp the stem to the saw. Tighten nuts using a suitable wrench.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2X/QM5T/JTT5T3AN/F2XQM5TJTT5T3AN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYB/WRXA/JTT5T3AS/FYBWRXAJTT5T3AS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F55/SUTY/JTT5T3AU/F55SUTYJTT5T3AU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWC/SMSB/JTT5T6S0/FWCSMSBJTT5T6S0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Mounting Lamp Stem"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Wiring the lamp may differ slightly from the pictures depending on the components you purchase or scavenge for your lamp. The cord I used was scavenged from a old stereo amp and the colors differ from a typical cord which would have a white neutral and a black hot wire.\n-Strip outer insulation from cord. You will need to strip enough insulation from the cord to feed the neutral and hot wire up the lamp stem. Measure the length of the lamp stem and add about 2 inches to that for wiring the lamp fixture. I have found the best way to cut the insulation is to bend the cord in a loop and lightly cut the outer edge of the loop. Be careful not to cut into the wires.\n-Once the insulation has been cut pull the outer insulation off the wires.\n-Feed the wires through the lamp stem and route the wires through the saw and out of the saw. I used the original strain relief and wire clamp to clamp the wires.\n-Strip the wire ends and attach the ground. Strip about a 1/4 inch off the end of the wires to attach to the lamp base. I also attached the ground to the original ground location. While most lamps do not have a ground it does add a level of safety and since I used the 3 wire cord to retain the look of the saw I was able to ground the lamp.\n-Remove the base from the lamp fixture, in most cases this will just clip on but some fixtures may use screws. Route the wires through the fixture base and thread the base to the stem. I used a nut to jam nut the base so it would not turn.\n-Wire the fixture. The socket will typically slide out of the outer tube allowing access to the terminals. You will notice that one terminal has a lighter color than the other this indicates it is the neutral terminal and should be attached to the white wire on a typical cord. I added pictures showing another socket and a cord with white and black wires.\nTest the wiring. If the lamp is not wired properly it will still work however the neutral wire will be switched instead of the hot wire, this leaves the outer portion of the socket energized at all times which is dangerous. I did a quick continuity check with a multi meter to ensure it was properly wired.

By cutting the base out first, you can check to make sure that it isn't warped before engraving it.

The bevel gear is created by laminating layers of 1.5mm plywood cut to form a gear with a mitred profile.\nI run Little Sandbox, a kids tech club and maker space, with Helen, Soosie and Snoofers. One of the most popular activities in our homeschool group is animation, the kids love telling stories with stop motion. Sometimes we like to get away from the screens, get the pens out and make flip books and thaumatropes. I wanted to make a zoetrope with our laser cutter that we could use in club. The design is based on the 1860's William Ensign Lincoln design, with viewing slits above an interchangeable strip of images.\nZoetrope animations are short, this example has sixteen frames, so at 24 frames per second that is two thirds of a second. There's not really time to follow a narrative arc in these films, but for short repeating movements they work really well. A historical example of the type of motion that works well is the study by Eadweard Muybridge of a horse's gait. Snoofers created the animation shown here, they have written a section of this instructable describing how to create your own animation strips.\nAnimations play fairly smoothly, although it has a stroboscopic effect so care should be taken if this causes medical problems. This is also true of the example video in this instructable.\nNone of the steps in assembly are particularly difficult but there are a lot of components and some are similar. I've tried to include plenty of photographs to show the steps. Unless you are particularly dexterous with tweezers or magnetic screwdrivers I would recommend using blu tack to hold nuts in place until the bolt is beginning to catch the thread.\nI've made the back panel out of clear acrylic to show the cogs meshing and how the living hinge door works. There is also a transparent acrylic pouch on the front of the base. This is to hold the movie poster for the current film being shown.\nYou will need lots of 3mm and 1.5mm birch ply and some 3mm transparent acrylic. I designed it to be as large as I could fit on a machine with bed dimensions of 300x400mm. The files are grouped by section and the filename includes the material they should be cut from to make it easier to identify them. Whatever size material you use, the pieces will pack more efficiently if you split the contents of these files across the sheets you cut.\nIn all cut files the following colours have been used;\nBlack - Engrave\nGreen - Surface mark line\nAll other colours - Full depth cut\nIn addition to the sheet materials you will also need;\nA 3mm bamboo skewer (for the axles)\n119 x 10mm M3 bolts\n8 x 12mm M3 bolts\n8 x 15mm M3 bolts\n135 x M3 nuts\nThreadlock\nWax for lubrication\nPVA glue\nWood filler\nMatt black spraypaint\nA small piece of blu tack\nThis animation and the box decorations were created by Snoofers.

This approach works on a small scale but I wanted to make the biggest Zoetrope I could so I wanted something sturdier. Even simple beveled gear profiles aren't very easy to achieve in a laser cutter that works only perpendicular to the material surface. So I borrowed the principle from additive manufacturers of building up a mitred gear profile in layers of thin plywood.\nI usually work in Inkscape to create cut paths, and came up with a method based on its involute gear generator.\nThis can be found in the menu\nExtensions -> Render -> Gear -> Gear\nSet the number of teeth, I've used twelve for the crank cog and eighteen for the drive cog. The circular pitch determines how thick the teeth are, as long as it is the same for all your gears they will mesh correctly. Because they are being made from wood this needs to be fairly large compared to values we would normally use for metal or plastic gears, I used 24mm for this build. The other two fields can be left as default values.\nThe cogs produced will be the middle slice of our final gears. I've used eight slices cut from 1.5mm sheets, giving a thickness of 12mm for the final cog. To make the other slices it's simply a case of scaling this cog's height and width uniformly by twice the thickness of the material, ie 3mm per slice in this case. I made three progressively smaller cogs and four that increase in size. It's a good idea to number the cogs to make assembly easier. I'd also recommend rotating alternate gears when you cut them to cross the wood grain and make the final gear stronger.\nThe gear profiles produced are 'pixellated' steps between the layers rather than a smooth face. I had expected to need to file these flat but the cogs mesh well and run smoothly enough to drive the zoetrope without sanding or filing.\nIf you are more comfortable using 3d design packages an alternative approach would be to model gears in a 3d package and then slice the model using the thickness of the material as the layer height. This could be done in Fusion 360 and the Slicer plugin. If you use other 3d design software such as OpenSCAD or Tinkercad to create a model you can user Slic3r to convert the model into slices for laser cutting.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSI/6SIW/JTT5SOQ3/FSI6SIWJTT5SOQ3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F46/RE7V/JTT5SOSU/F46RE7VJTT5SOSU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Design the Gears"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Each cog is made up of eight slices cut from 1.5mm plywood, two pieces that make the axle cut from 3mm material and four 15mm M3 bolts and nuts. I rotated every other slice before cutting so that the grain of the wood is crossed in the finished piece.\nI haven't had any problems running the cogs without glue, the four bolts hold the slices together well enough for the gears to work. For later iterations of this design I have glued each layer, using the axle to line them up.\nThe support for the gears fixes to the base panel, the small cog fits between the two uprights to keep everything aligned. This part is quite fiddly to put together but forms a solid base.\nStart with the frame that supports the larger gear. Use 8 10mm bolts to assemble this piece.\nSlot this into the two long supports.\nFit the small cog and washers into the final upright and locate the tabs into the long support piece, use two more 10mm bolts to fix this in place.\nUse seven more 10mm bolts to fix this structure to the base.\nThere are two more struts to add to the upright to fix it to the side panel, you'll need another four 10mm bolts for this, and three to secure the bottom of the side panel.\nThe side panel is the first of the external pieces in this build so if you're planning on finishing the wood it's a good idea to do it before this part of the assembly.

As well as the laser cut parts you will need four 15mm lengths of 3mm bamboo skewer for the wheel axles.\nStart by fixing the sixteen panels to the bottom hoop, with the viewing slots at the top. There is a right way up for the bottom hoop, if the panels don't fit together neatly to form a drum - it's upside down. It's a good idea to glue as well as bolt these pieces in place, that way you can remove the bolts temporarily before you paint it.\nNext glue and bolt the top hoop in place. The panels should fit together quite tightly, but there will be gaps. Filling these gaps will make for a better animation effect. I used masking tape on the inside of the joins and a flexible filler applied from the outside. When it's dry sand the joints smooth.\nPainting the drum matt black will reduce the light reflected from the outside of the drum between frames. I found it easier to take out the bolts while I did this. I placed the drum inside a cardboard box with all the cracks taped up (to protect the carpet and wall) and spraypainted the drum using many thin layers, rotating the drum once one spray was dry and going over each area about 3 times in the course of many rotations. I also spraypainted the top brackets for the wheels, and the brackets that will hold the film in place (the film brackets needed turning once one side was fully covered and dry). Be careful with it whilst painting; since it has no bolts in it it's a bit more fragile.\nThe four wheels are made up of two brackets each, one fixed at either side of the bottom hoop. Line up the bottom one, then drop in the wheel and bamboo axle. Place the second bracket over the top and fix in place with 12mm M3 bolts.

We figured since I did this part, it might be easier and more sensible if I wrote the steps.\nSo the first thing I want to point out is that we've provided the same \"film\" we used in our photos and videos for you to try if you want to; it's called animation.svg. Secondly, we've also provided an svg called \"blank strip\" that's already the right size to work with this zoetrope, so you can either create digital images and drop them in (if you have snapping active in Inkscape, you should be able to snap the right size images in there) or you can print it off blank and draw them by hand. The right size, by the way, is 67.518 mm by 45.314 mm - sorry about the awkward sizing, there was a lot of trial and error involved in getting the strip to be exactly the right length.\nWhat I found easiest was to use the multiple layers in GIMP to facilitate animation. With only 16 frames, you want to keep it simple, so I just drew \"Grobot\" who grows and shrinks. To make that easier, I put the \"floor,\" the legs, the arms and the head each on their own layer. That way, I could save the initial image, then move individual parts, then save that image, and so on. Seeing as Grobot is only growing and shrinking, I made 8 frames and then duplicated them again in the reverse order. This achieved two things; it made the animation simple and quick, and it allowed me to duplicate frames 1 and 8 to give him slightly more time at his smallest and at his tallest, which looked quite pleasing in the animated gif I created to preview the animation.\nI found that high contrast helps the images be clearer - again, they've moving fast and your eyes have to compensate for the \"shuttering\" of the drum being spun around. The original animations featured a robot who was white, except for his black outlines, but for the final I went with a darkish grey colour to help him stand out more, and it really made the animation work better in the zoetrope.\nI did experiment a fair bit - there's a robot who grows, then flashes green eyes and a green glow from his antenna, a robot who draws a red heart in mid-air with his antenna, and a robot who hasn't got a bobble at the top of his antenna but obtains one from the gloop dripping from the ceiling, then shakes it off and shrinks back down. I found that fine detail is absolutely easily lost in the zoetrope, and colours have to be very bold to stand out, which is why I wound up going (for now!) with a plain grow-and-shrink grey robot. I heartily recommend experimenting though!\nTo make animated gifs out of my images, I exported them from GIMP as PNGs, then used ImageMagick to turn them into an animated gif. We were aiming for 24 frames per second, so the commandline for ImageMagick was:\nconvert -delay 4.1 1.png 2.png 3.png 4.png 5.png 6.png 7.png 8.png 8.png 7.png 6.png 5.png 4.png 3.png 2.png 1.png animation.gif\nIf you're not using Linux or not able to use ImageMagick, there are loads of tools to make individual images into animated gifs - but seeing how an animation works out before you go to the trouble of printing and sticking can be really valuable for minor adjustments like a movement you're not quite keen on now you see it in action, or realising (ahem) that you've accidentally subbed in a white robot with your grey ones. As a random example that definitely didn't happen to me (twice).\nTo turn your animation into a film strip, once you've pasted your images into the svg file, print them off (I only have access to an A4 printer, so while I've adjusted the document size to fit the strips perfectly for the svg, to print I use a document size of A4 and then print the animation over two pages containing two strips each). Cut them out carefully, whilst trying to leave as little white and as much black as possible. Next, put strip 1 (frames 1-4) and strip 2 (frames 5-8) together face-down, with the black tab after frame 4 overlapping frame 5 on the second strip. Using sellotape, tape over the tab, then using two more strips of sellotape, tape over the little corners you cut out to really secure the two together. Repeat for strips 3 (frames 9-12) and 4 (frames 13-16). Don't stick strip 4 to strip 1, as it'll make it a lot harder to insert the lot into the zoetrope.\nNow your strip is ready, carefully slide it behind the upright clips in the drum of the zoetrope. The leftover tab should slot neatly behind frame 1, leaving a perfect array of frames surrounded by plain black.\nThat's it!

I didn\u2019t want to overwork the motor in the shop vac every time I used this brush.\nI assumed this hole would be easy enough to cover with your hand while using the attachment to get more suction, but wasn't positive.\nI decided to cut the hole in the part of the attachment that is most like a cylinder and used a matching part from a nearly identical handle to make a cover that could be used to control the amount of suction to the attachment. I cut the cylinder part out of the matching piece and cut a potion out of one side of the cylinder. See the pictures for more detail. This allows the cover to slide over the attachment and cover as much of the new hole as you want.\nI did forget to take into consideration the part of the shop vac hose that extends inside the attachment, so some of the hole I cut into the attachment is covered (from the inside) with the end of the hose.

I decided if the hot glue didn't hold well or started coming apart then I could remake the squid brush with some other type of adhesive. Maybe epoxy would be a better long term adhesive, but would take longer to use.\nBefore I started gluing the tubes inside the attachment I thought it would be good to rough up the inside of the attachment opening using a Dremel with a grinder disc on a rotary tool. I thought that might help the hot glue stick to the surface better by making a rougher surface. This is really up to you.\nI took some of the tubing pieces I pre-cut and held them inside the opening to see how well they fit and what pattern of the tubing layouts would work best.\nI decided the best thing to do was to start on the bottom at one side with the first piece and move across from there.\nThe next row of tubing I placed in between the tubing in the first row.

The 2-1/2 inch diameter shop vac hose was just too large to get into those tight areas.\nYou can see that the squid brush does a great job of cleaning in grooves and holes of various sizes. The tubing is flexible enough to conform to the shape of the area, but rigid enough to hold it\u2019s shape.\nIn some of the video testing I used coffee grounds since it makes it easier to see the results.

No, but you might want to use this for spilled coffee in a kitchen drawer full of utensils.\nOne thing I realized is that you can suck the dust out of very small holes by inserting just one of the tubes into the hole.\nI set up a couple deep slot layouts using two pieces of clear acrylic with sawdust poured between them.

At least I thought so and named it for that. Please post any other names you can think of in the comments below.\nI really like the way it turned out. In fact, I made one for my smaller shop vac so I could use it more easily when cleaning out our cars. It has been really useful for cleaning out the cup holders and center consoles.\nIs it pretty? Absolutely not, but it is incredibly useful and it was very cheap for such a functional new tool to add to the shop. I already had the shop vac attachments that I made the squid brush out of and the tubing was the only material needed. The 25 foot long roll of tubing cost $3.50 at a local home store. Since I made two squid brushes with the tubing I made each one for under $2.00 if you don't take into account my time to put them together.\nI think it worked out well to have the opening cut on the back side of the brush to allow for additional air flow since the tubing drastically cuts down on the amount of open area that goes into the shop vac hose. Being able to adjust the suction by changing the opening size really gives the brush some flexibility.\nIt's also very easy to use your hand to cover the opening on the back of the brush when you want to increase the suction temporarily.\nOne thing I didn't think about was the situation where a larger item that is too large to be sucked through the tubing is encountered. If it is sucked up against the end of the tubing it is easy to pull the piece off the end and then just drop it in the new airflow opening you cut in the back of the attachment.\nMy intent in making this brush wasn't to create something that would vacuum up a large volume of material, but rather to vacuum up a relatively small amount of dust or saw dust from hard to reach places.\nIf you think you could benefit from making this brush I highly recommend it. I have used both of my squid brushes many times since I made them.\nAs you can see, the squid brush is great for cleaning the dust out of containers with items like nuts, bolts, and screws. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I wish I would have had this when I sorted through a container of nuts and bolts and blowing the dust out of the pieces with good old lung power. I'm sure I'll be using this more and more.\nI hope this is something you find useful or saves you time when cleaning in your shop or around your home.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUC/6BOU/JTMSUGWE/FUC6BOUJTMSUGWE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8B/VW13/JTMSUGWF/F8BVW13JTMSUGWF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8V/0G13/JTMSUGUR/F8V0G13JTMSUGUR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXD/K78F/JTMSUGUU/FXDK78FJTMSUGUU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHT/IWIN/JTMSSO5Y/FHTIWINJTMSSO5Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0C/AIRT/JTMSSO5V/F0CAIRTJTMSSO5V.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Final Thoughts"}], "channel": ""}, {"category": "", "description": "Have you ever been the victim of such puns as, \u2018\u2019This electronic stud finder must be working, it started going off as soon as I touched it!\u2019\u2019 told repeatedly by such \u2018\u2019studs\u2019\u2019 as our fathers.
