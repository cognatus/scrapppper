There are different kind of looms, but this tutorial will cover only lap/stand loom, since they are pretty much the same.\nWarp - is a thread which is strung over your loom vertically and serves as a base for your weaving. It is very important to use a good quality thread (usually cotton), it shouldn\u2019t be stretchy or thick or fluffy (you can experiment with those ones later). I sell looms already with warp thread so you can see how it is made and what kind of yarn it is better to start with.\nWeft thread - this is the thread which goes horizontally between the warp threads. This is the main thread you use for your weaving, which creates design.\nShuttle/needle - these are useful instruments for weaving, but honestly, you can start weaving without any instruments at all - just a loom and yarns. But if you have them - great! Just play around and see if it is comfortable for you to use them. If it is not very comfy, leave them alone and try making a knot at the end of the weft thread.\nMaterials used in weaving can vary; it is up to your imagination. Most popular are: merino wool, cotton threads, different kind of effect yarn (silk/velvet/tshirt yarn), different ribbons and laces.\nYou will also need something to hang your weaving on - it can be wooden dowel found on the beach or in the park, metal pipe from your closest construction store, or wooden frames and even embroidery hoops.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ2/ZX1N/JTON69ZQ/FZ2ZX1NJTON69ZQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Getting to Know All Useful Terms"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "So how and where should you start?

Take cotton thread and make a loop knot in the end\n2. Take your loom, put this loop on the very left tab\n3. Go down to the bottom tab, make a round around it\n4. Go up and continue till the last tab\n5. Tie off your warp in a knot when done\nThe main trick here - hold your warp in tension while you are doing these steps because all warp threads must have the same strong tension.\nHooray, your base is all set, let\u2019s start weaving!\nSome people weave upside down, but I prefer to start from the bottom.

(this way the tail will stay at the back of your work). Loop your weft thread up and around the second warp, so the weft comes back out over the top of the second warp. Pass the weft over the second and third warp. Loom up and around the third warp, so your thread come back over the top of the third warp. If you want to create a braid look, all you have to do is complete your row of soumak stitches, then go back the other way making soumak stitches following the same steps in reverse side.\nRya knot - or tassels - place yarn strands over the warp threads.

Don\u2019t worry if length is not identical, you will cut it in the end.\nStep3: Tie one row of rya knots\nStep4: Make another half row of rya knots using any effect yarns.

The only difference is that you leave it looser than plain weave.\nStep5: Using different yarns we are making two rows of soumak weave. Yarns were very thin, that is why I took 3 threads at once\nStep6: Making some rows of plain weave using effect yarn\nStep7: Make some rows of round tassels using cotton thread in plain weave technique (same as we used in Step4). You can make it in the same length, I prefer different for the better effect. Make these tassels from different yarns\nStep8: Say hello to merino wool! Everyone loves that fluffy clouds make of this yarn, but not everyone knows that it is soooo easy to make them. This is just random technique - the base is from plain weave but you skip random number of warp threads. Make it as fluffy and big as you want :)\nStep9: Using plain weave technique I finished the weaving. Used double thread here to make it look better\nStep10: Almost done!

You can test the circuit by touching the needle to one of the positive terminals.\nPlace the fabric with the circuit in place under the shirt. Push the needle through the shirt and attach one side of the switch by sewing through the shirt and the piece of fabric holding the circuit. Sew at least four stitches before tying off.

My mom owned an aquarium business when I was growing up and we previously kept regular tank raised seahorses, so I felt well armed enough to give dwarves a try this year when I saw a local herd that needed re-homing (via craigslist). As one of my seahorse forum colleagues says \"they are absolutely the best fish, but SO much work\".\nSaltwater aquarium keeping requires a certain level of financial commitment and routine maintenance that isn't for everyone. Seahorses have specific care parameters that whittle that pool of people down further. Dwarf seahorses are their own thing entirely and require perhaps even more particular care. If you like the idea of a living zen garden that must be tended daily, the dwarf seahorses might be for you. Of all my pets, they are the ones I have to be most delicate with and most attentive to. My cats, tortoise, and geckos take care of themselves in a lot of ways. Dwarf seahorses require daily ritual and close attention.\nIn this Ible, I'll review the care basics topic by topic, what to expect from dwarf seahorses, how to know if they're for you, and some approaches to care that have worked for me personally. Plus, lots of super cute photos! Since there's not a ton of education out there about dwarf seahorse keeping, I hope this can provide another helpful perspective. As with all animals, I want to see the right pets with the right people, so that the animals thrive.\nDwarf seahorses are an intermediate level fish at least, so in the Instructable I will assume some things about your aquarium base knowledge. For example, I'm not going to go over what a water change is or how to do it, because you either already know or can look it up a million places. We WILL discuss how to mix water for seahorses and WHEN water changes should be done in regard to their specific care. I will link to products and terms throughout, but always google an aquarium term you aren't familiar with before embarking on a new tank.\nRegarding contests: A few years ago I wrote a guide to standard seahorse care, but it was very flawed since I wasn't keeping any in my own home at the time. My write up was based on memory of having kept them in my childhood, old books (we're talking 1980's), and care guides available elsewhere on the internet. It simply wasn't original or up to my usual Ible bar, nor was it a great reflection of current standards for seahorse care. THIS Instructable --as a Remix-- allows me to give you a much more thorough and first hand guide to dwarf seahorses and how to help them thrive. We took an old idea and made it better (and cuter). It is important to recognize when you can improve, especially when animal care is the topic.", "title": "Keeping Dwarf Seahorses", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Keeping-Dwarf-Seahorses/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Have Aquarium Keeping Experience --First off, I would not advise anyone who has never kept a successful aquarium to dive into dwarf seahorses. Monitoring water quality and knowing how to effectively and safely change tank water is a must --this is not a tank you can set, forget, and maybe get around to cleaning once the algae prevents you from seeing in. You need to be willing to observe the tank every day and address issues asap. Seahorses don't tolerate a low quality environment. You don't need to be a master level expert, but you need to have kept a tank alive for a stretch of time and if the fish died, you understand why. Know what water changes are and how to do them, understand what \"cycling a tank\" is, and research your supplies, parts, and food sources well before you acquire any seahorses.\nBe Prepared for the Expense of Saltwater --Marine tanks are more difficult to keep, and require more in the way of supplies. While dwarf tanks do not require the big fancy skimmers, chillers, and lighting that reef style tanks do, there are some things you always need to have on hand that will be new to fresh water keepers. You will need to be buying a constant supply of aquarium salt made for creating marine water. I would hope this goes without saying, but NO --you can NOT use the same salt you'd use in the kitchen. Iodized salt is toxic to fish and does not provide the same mineral benefits that a salt made for making marine water, like Instant Ocean, puts in the water.\nBe Willing and Able to Hatch and Administer LIVE food EVERY DAY --Dwarf seahorses are ridiculously tiny, and thus need ridiculously tiny food. The most plentiful and accessible is live baby brine shrimp (often referred to as bbs). You will need to hatch these yourself, because live food this small is rarely offered in pet stores. Hatching them is not difficult, but does require dedication to a daily ritual you can NOT skip. You'll also need to occasionally enrich the bbs with a supplement, to help ensure the seahorses are getting a good nutritive value.\nBe Willing to Have a Seahorse ONLY tank --Regular seahorses are slow and have specific needs that make very few other fish suitable roommates. Due to their size, dwarves have even fewer compatible tank mates. For success with your first dwarf seahorses, I STRONGLY suggest keeping ONLY dwarf seahorses in your tank. If you think you'll get bored and want something faster, wigglier or with more variety, then this is not the right hobby for you.\nHave a Plan for Babies --If kept in proper conditions that keep them happy, dwarf seahorses WILL breed. I repeat: WILL BREED! I've read several different ranges for how many young to expect per batch, and it seems like between 4-15 is a good ball park. My own dwarves had 7, 9, and 4 (different dads on different weekends of the same month). What will you do if your seahorses breed and start to overpopulate the tank? Are you willing to set up a second tank? Willing to establish a relationship with a local fish store to sell them stock? Willing to be picky enough with private re-homings that you don't just let any jerk off CL have some that they'll probably kill in days? Mull over the eventual baby scenario and see how you feel. If you're not sure, you may wish to purchase all females as you start up and learn. They are just as entertaining and still come in fun colors.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHC/TM58/JTIYLOM1/FHCTM58JTIYLOM1.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: PreReqs and the Need to Know"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Dwarf seahorses only have a life expectancy of about 1yr, though there are some reports flying around online that say up to 2yrs is possible in captivity. Given this short life span, it is nice to have a little breeding in your tank to replenish your stock naturally over time. If babies sound like too much for you to deal with, you can, of course, just purchase new horses when yours have lived out their expectancies.\nThey are TINY-- only about 1.5 inch tall max, maybe 2 inches with tail fully extended. When babies are first born from the father's pouch they barely seem larger than a fish turd with eyes, but they grow quickly in their first weeks.\nBoth adults and babies require tiny food, but can eat the same food (no further specialization required for babies). Freshly hatched brine shrimp is good for any age of dwarf seahorse.\nThey are mostly slow moving, but are very active and fun to watch. You'll see a lot of fun behavior first thing in the morning when you turn on your tank light. Dwarves are eager for the morning feeding and this is also prime time for couples to do mating dances (and maybe even \"do the deed\").\nThey have personalities. If you're observing them consistently you will see that some have definite quirks. I have some who are very proactive eaters, some who seem more lazy, and some who seem to like hanging out around the babies. You'll see who likes to hang out with each other --and on rare occasion-- who doesn't like each other. While dwarf seahorses aren't 100% monogamous like some other species, you will see some consistency in the couples holding tails and doing mating dances. I've noticed some males have a preference for a particular color of girlfriend. A dwarf tank is an adorable little soap opera if you're sitting in front of it long enough to watch.\nThey come in many colors, and can shift colors. Some retailers will let you request colors and others won't, saying \"seahorses change colors so we can't guarantee anything\". Well, yes and no. Every seahorse has a \"base\" color that they are most of the time, but most are capable of shifting to a few other shades within a range. I have a guy who is usually pale yellow but can also go sandy brown or near white. I have a female who is pearl white most of the time but can also get gray patches or swing a little mossy green. Black seahorses are mostly just black, though my male does lighten his body when doing a mating dance, to show off some brown stripes he has. Ordering your first batch of dwarf seahorses is kind of like a blind box toy experience; even if you requested colors, you never know quite what you'll receive and often get some pleasant surprises.\nTheir poop is weird. I started seeing these little red clumps on the tank floor and thought they were dead copepods (food) or paint flaking off my decorations. Then I saw one of these clumps coming out of somebody and it all clicked: Poop! The reddish color is totally normal and is a product of the color of brine shrimp. These little red lumps are what you'll want to vacuum up multiple times a week so the waste doesn't build up in your water.\nThey are work. You are in charge of a tiny world that needs to stay very clean and very safe. If you like routine and meditative tasks, they may be a good fit for you.If you aren't a routine or commitment person, go with freshwater guppies!

Within the U.S. it is unlikely you'll find dwarves in your local aquarium store unless you live in the Gulf of Mexico region. Mail order --while I don't love doing that with living things-- is the way to acquire dwarves.\nWhile you'll find captive bred/tank raised to be more expensive, it is important to be mindful of where our pet fish come from. Healthy oceans need to become a much bigger global priority than they are right now, and one step you can take as an individual is supporting captive bred fish industries over irresponsible harvesting from the ocean. Wild caught specimens also carry some risk of disease or illness, simply because you don't know where they've been. If an online retailer does not declare that their stock is \"captive bred\" or \"tank raised\", chances are they aren't, but you can always email and ask!\nMake sure to deal only with sellers who use overnight mail for shipping, and who offer cold or heat packs, depending on your time of year. Be mindful of the delivery windows to make sure you are home for the arrival of the parcel. Many companies will not ship past Wednesday to eliminate any chance that the box gets hung up in a shipping facility over a weekend. This is ultimately a very responsible thing to do, but may not be as convenient for you as a weekend delivery. I had to plan to arrive late to work to receive a Tuesday morning delivery of new stock.\nBuying from a source who cares about the animals' comfort during transit is important. Sometimes you can find unboxing videos on YouTube for a company you're considering, to get an idea of what you can expect and the level of care they put into transporting live stock. Online product reviews can also tell you a lot about shipping practices and vendor communication.\nRetailers I am personally familiar with:\nFoxy Saltwater Tropicals--Located in Florida. Very nice to deal with, lots of care taken to ensure the seahorses are safe and well during travel. Their site allows you to make color requests when ordering males and they try their best to send what you're looking for. I was very impressed with the bold colors I received and all dwarves purchased from him are still doing great. Shipping/packaging was excellent. I have a feeling Foxy's dwarves may be wild caught, or only a few generations tank raised, simply because he is local to where they can be found and his prices are the lowest. Despite the liklihood that these dwarves are wild caught, everything else about Foxy's leads me to believe they are a responsible small business who truly care about the ocean.\nAlyssa's SeaHorse Savvy--Located in Maryland. If you're looking for captive bred in the U.S., this may be among the best. The photos of her dwarf stock are simply amazing; tons of cirri and very chubby! This isn't just a fish store, this is a seahorse specific farm/retailer, so you know she knows her stuff. The owner is active in a forum I visit and very helpful. Her dwarves are more expensive than some other sites, but you are assured that everything is 100% healthy and ethically on the up and up.

The adults all have names since I can tell them apart easily. Even though sometimes colors fluctuate, you can identify seahorses by other features like size, body shape, and any distinctive \"cirri\" (the little bristly points some of them have). I have nice variety of colors in my community, including black, tan, white, yellow, reddish, green, and 2 \"piebald\" gold with brown spots.\nFemales:\nCleo, Big Bertha, Queenie, Pearl, Snork, Daria, Woody\nMales:\nNeener, Preggo, Terry Crews, Red Velvet, Adam", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F4A/4C6C/JTCRJQ8Z/F4A4C6CJTCRJQ8Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7W/AXE3/JTCRJQ5I/F7WAXE3JTCRJQ5I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSQ/FPTS/JTENDZGG/FSQFPTSJTENDZGG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7W/56JU/JTENDZGI/F7W56JUJTENDZGI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP6/611J/JTENDZXN/FP6611JJTENDZXN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB7/16QR/JTIYLOWV/FB716QRJTIYLOWV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: My Herd"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Tank Size --You can feasibly keep a few pairs of dwarves in a set up as small as 2 gallons, but this is not recommended as a long term solution, especially because they WILL breed and you'll have more soon. Most keepers suggest a tank 5-10gallons, but NO larger than 10!The main reason is food density.\nSeahorses move slowly and do not chase down food. Ideally, you want a tank situation where food can just rain down straight on their heads and they can snap it up easily. Think like if you went outside and opened your mouth, trying to catch snowflakes on your tongue. Each seahorse needs to catch enough snowflakes in their mouth to get a full belly at least twice daily, and that's way easier to do in a small tank vs. an expansive one. Bbs are also attracted to light and tend to congregate at the surface when your tank light is on. If you have a big tank with seahorses hitched to decor at the bottom and all your bbs way up top, never the two shall meet and everyone starves.\nSo why not go as small as possible then? The reason is water quality and ensuring your seahorses never experience any shock during water changes. Many keepers say that a 10 gallon is easiest for maintaining safe water parameters while still balancing the need to stay \"small\". Tanks under 5 gallons do create a scenario in which any change can feel like a BIG change, and sudden changes can be shocking to seahorses and cause them to die.\nI personally keep a 5 gallon and have been very happy with it. I avoid shocking water changes by keeping them small, and throughout the week. More on water changes later.\nLighting-- Dwarf seahorses do not require any special type of lighting. The lights that come in the hood of most aquarium kits will be fine. I got a tank with an LED strip in the hood because I didn't want the light generating excess heat. It also had some cool color options I can toggle between, which I thought might be neat for faking dusk in the tank before lights out.\nYou do want your seahorses to get 10-12 hours of light each day, especially if you want to encourage breeding. If they get a nice 12 hour \"day\" they'll feel like it is summer and breeding season.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPQ/XK4G/JTENDZXP/FPQXK4GJTENDZXP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUT/Q885/JTEN5E7E/FUTQ885JTEN5E7E.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: The Tank: Think Small"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Reef tanks are beautiful, but they don't mix with dwarf seahorses. If you love that look, consider doing a regular marine tank instead!\nNO Live Rock/Sand/Coral --Small organisms in live rock and live sand can be harmful to them. In particular, small stinging creatures called hydroids are very pesky and should be avoided at all costs, and eliminated if you see them. Parasites can also come in on this stuff. Even if live rock or sand has been dry for a while, creatures like this can reinvigorate when placed in saltwater again. To avoid having to combat all sorts of micro-foes, it is best to keep live rock and sand out of your dwarf seahorse situation.\nCorals can not only sting (some varieties) but also require very specific care all their own to thrive. Some people keep tanks ONLY of amazing corals and invertebrates for this reason. They're awesome, but they just don't mix with seahorses safely.\nFake Decor is Best -- The absolute safest thing to use for dwarves is artificial decor. They don't mind one bit --seahorses will hitch to anything they can get a tail around! Choose fake plants with long stems and skinny leaves that will be easy for them to grab. Remember that their natural habitat is in fields of sea grass. Fake sea fans or fake corals with skinny bits are great too. Choose items that are different heights so your dwarves can choose to hitch low, middle, or high in the tank. Having different levels allows them a variety of options for feeding and social hitching, and also makes it easer for you to view them.\nI've personally bent the fake rule just slightly:\nThe \"real\" items in my tank are an old dried sea fan and some small pieces of dried coral. Again, small skinny branches easy to hitch to are key. I felt ok putting these in the tank because I have personally owned them for over 20yrs and know for a fact they've been dry for a long time. The likelihood of any creepy crawlies coming out them is pretty much 0%. Natural shells can be ok too, but the seahorses almost never hitch to them and they just become something you have to shove around while cleaning.\nPro Tip:I keep a set of plastic tweezers near the tank in case I have a reason I need to move a plant, or if I see a big fat hair in the tank (which is often since I have 3 cats and long hair myself). As with any aquarium, you don't want to put your fingers in the water if there's any chance you have soap residue or lotion on your skin. Those substances can ruin your water and kill fish quickly. Using tweezers instead of my fingers reduces the chances that I'll put a foreign substance in the mix.\n\nMacro Algae -- One dwarf safe live thing you can put in the tank is macro algae. But isn't algae a bad thing in a tank? Well, usually, but this is a different sort of plant life. Macro Algaes are leafy or grassy, and feed on the waste nutrients produced in your tank. By doing this, they can help keep your water cleaner and they tend to outcompete regular nuisance algae (the type on your glass) so that a lot less of that ever forms. I purchased some very finger-like red macro algae and have found that it is a great for babies to hang on to. Just know that if it really does well and grows, you might have to trim it back to a size you like.\nBare Floors-- Many keepers suggest a bare tank floor simply because it is easier to clean. Dwarves need tank maintenance several times a week, and having to shove around gravel is a pain for you and a big scary disruption for them. Using a small modified gravel vac to skim waste off the bare floor is quick and easy.\nBare floors also make it so much easier to see baby seahorses. You'd feel awful if you accidentally sucked one up in the gravel vac or clobbered it while moving decorations. With bare floors, you can see where everyone is and not run the risk.\n\"Vacuuming\" -- Bare floors allow you to spot clean the poo and debris simply. Traditional syphoning and gravel vacs are pretty risky with something as small as dwarf seahorses, so I built a mini safety vac based on another keeper's design I saw in a forum.\n1 clean drinking straw, 1 length of airline tubing, 1 plastic milkshake spoon,\n1 piece of clean kitchen sponge (no added chemicals or abrasive materials!), 3 rubber bands.\nThe sponge at the mouth of the vacuum prevents anything unexpected, like a baby seahorse, from slipping into the straws suction. The milkshake spoon's function is simply a little added structure and area to grip.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTE/5GHW/JTCRK9A8/FTE5GHWJTCRK9A8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGP/BTHN/JTCRJQ4O/FGPBTHNJTCRJQ4O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7S/RJK2/JTCRK9E8/F7SRJK2JTCRK9E8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX0/LZ40/JTCRK9AJ/FX0LZ40JTCRK9AJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F28/XN53/JTCRK9AU/F28XN53JTCRK9AU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIF/AJQN/JTCRJPZ5/FIFAJQNJTCRJPZ5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6O/6UFJ/JTCRK99L/F6O6UFJJTCRK99L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH2/MZL2/JTCRK99X/FH2MZL2JTCRK99X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F52/8HFD/JTCRJPMT/F528HFDJTCRJPMT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9I/TEHD/JTCRJPO6/F9ITEHDJTCRJPO6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJP/EMQH/JTCRJPOS/FJPEMQHJTCRJPOS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3E/RLIP/JTCRK9DL/F3ERLIPJTCRK9DL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Tank Decorations: Fake It!

The flow will knock them all around the tank, and the intakes tend to take the bbs away too soon and can also suck up babies! No bueno.\nThere are things you can do to make a traditional filters safer and reduce the flow. Cover w pantyhose or baffle with sponges. I still found food taken away too soon and didnt feel like the trickle of flow I had dialed down to was providing enough oxygen exchange.\nThe safest, simplest, and perhaps cheapest option is a Sponge Filter. They're kind of ugly, but are normally used for fish fry tanks and thus have the safety of tiny things in mind. Running a regular air pump line into a sponge filter creates a very, very gentle suction to catch debris on the sponge and also ensures you're getting plenty of oxygen exchange.\nRinsing the filter -- At every major cleaning you may wish to rinse the excess surface debris from your sponge filter. Mine tends to be covered in tiny poo and also the many cat hairs that manage to sneak into the tank. After you remove some water for a water change, swish your sponge in the wastewater to loosen debris. Do NOT squeeze the sponge or rinse under hot tap water. Doing so can mean losing a lot of the beneficial bacteria in your filter, which are doing the invisible work of ammonia and nitrite breakdown.\nI liked this mini air pump called the Hygger for its size and virtually silent operation. The bubbles in your water will make sound, but there isn't any additional vibrating from the pump. There was no need to use an air stone with this set up. In fact, larger bubbles are safer for your dwarves than ultra tiny ones, which can cause gas related illness.\nIf the airflow from your pump still seems a bit strong, you can install a bleed valve in your line so that you can customize the flow up or down without building pressure that pushes back on your pump. Just interrupt your airline with an air control valve you can buy at any PetCo. Dialing the bleed valve to allow air to escape the line reduces your flow to the tank and makes bubbles more gentle on your dwarves.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ0/Z0K9/JTCRJP66/FZ0Z0K9JTCRJP66.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUG/W0Z8/JTCRJP6Z/FUGW0Z8JTCRJP6Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCG/GLUX/JTCRJP8Y/FCGGLUXJTCRJP8Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBG/W12B/JTCRJPLG/FBGW12BJTCRJPLG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Filter and Air: Go Low Flow"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Dwarf seahorses are native to Gulf Coast waters (south eastern US/Mexico) and enjoy warmer temperatures.

Most will come with some kind of suction cup to attach to the wall of the tank.\nHave a thermometer. The adhesive kind that sticks to the tank wall is fine, but for more precise reading you can get a a true thermometer with mercury. Mine is a combination thermometer and hydrometer, so I can check salt level and temp in one go.\nIf you live somewhere that gets hot in the summer, you can test unplugging your heater for those months and monitoring water temperature to see where it settles. If room temp falls within the acceptable range, no need to add to the power bill.\nHot Times in the Seahorse Tank:\nSome keepers dial their heat up to 78 degrees to encourage breeding. This temp. fakes the summer breeding season dwarves would experience in the wild. While this trick is not a guarantee of offspring, it seems to work for a lot of keepers.

RO water is also a great pH for aquariums. This can often be purchased at local fish stores, or at the growing number of water stores that carry special drinking water for humans. I found one of these places simply by Yelping \"RO water\".\nOne can also use distilled or purified jugs from the grocery store, and prepare as directed.\nPetco sells pre-mixed salt water in a 5 gallon box, under their Imagitarium brand. It was great when I needed something in a pinch, but awfully expensive at $15. The store employee also admitted that \"there's no way this is real ocean water, no matter what it says on the box\".\nIn my personal experience, my treated tap water is fine provided you live somewhere with drinkable tap water, but I will spring for RO or distilled stuff if I think to stop by the water store while I'm out.\nObviously, you do need salt water since seahorses are marine fish. Their range of salinity tolerance is just like that of other salt tanks, so simply follow the preparation instructions provided on commercially available salt mixes. Use a Hydrometer to make sure you've achieved salinity within the accepted range.\nAdding Salt\n*When mixing your water, always use a bucket or jug dedicated to this task. Never use a container that has been exposed to detergents, soaps, or foods. It isn't worth the risk of cross contamination. If you involve a funnel in your process, same goes for the funnel.\nStep1-- No matter what type of water you use, treat with a dose of dechlorination drops to be safe. Many of these drops will also include helpful enzymes that stimulate your fish's natural body defenses.\nStep 2-- Measure your aquarium salt per gallons of water you are mixing. To achieve ideal marine salinity, the brand Instant Ocean instructs you to mix 1/2 cup salt per gallon of water.\nStep 3-- The salt will initially make your water cloudy. Stir in the salt using a clean instrument you use ONLY for aquarium work (no kitchen utensils that would ever have been exposed to cleaners or soaps). Stir until clear-ish. Water should settle and become entirely clear within 20 minutes.\nStep 4-- Store your remaining salt in a way where it will not be exposed to moisture. Roll and clip the plastic bag like you might chips. If salt absorbs moisture from the atmosphere it will turn into a big block that is a pain to break apart and use, and you'll also get some calcium residue sitting at the bottom of your water next time you mix. This usually only happens if salt is stored unused for a while, and is unlikely to be a problem if you're consistently using up boxes of salt.\nStep 5-- Store your mixed water in jugs to keep it spill proof and clean, and at the ready for your mid week water changes. This is especially important for me, because my cats would definitely play in the bucket if left out.\nSome aquarists like to let their water cure overnight before use. I have never found it imperative to do this, but your water is often clearer when the salt has even more time to dissolve evenly.\n**Expect to do multiple water changes throughout the week, especially if using a sponge filter! Since a dwarf tank will not have the high powered filter of a normal aquarium at work, you will need work harder to keep your water quality up. Different keepers have different opinions on water change frequency. Some people do a 50% change every day to maintain ideal low ammonia and nitrite levels. I do a 20% every other day and a 50% on the weekend.\n\nTesting Your Water\nA test kit is needed to be able to know where you stand with nitrates, nitrites, ammonia, and pH --all things that can kill your fish if they get out of whack. For freshwater tanks I've always used the less expensive and super easy dip test strips, but for salt water tanks you want to level up to the liquid kits that test for more things, and test more precisely. API makes a good one, and little has changed about it since my mom used it for her business 20yrs ago. The instructions for measuring each substance are different, but by following the instructions in the kit booklet you can see where your water stands in about 10 min. An easy color comparison chart shows you what's good and bad. If any of these substances tests in the \"bad\" range, you'll want to do a partial water change to reduce harmful substances. These liquid tests are MUCH more specific than the quick dip strips, and worth the investment for salt water.\n\nIn my demo photos, you'll see that my current tank water has excellent nitrite and ammonia levels, which was a big relief considering I've had the most trouble getting those under control. My pH, however, is low and on the brink of being acceptable. While the seahorses are tolerating it ok, this tells me it is time for me to get some RO water for my next water change. RO is more likely to be a true 8.0 and will help balance out my 7.4 tap when introduced via gradual water changes. I find this a safer way to adjust than using pH powders or drops, because those can adjust way more than you intend even if used as directed.\n\nIf you notice your seahorses acting strangely --lethargic, not swimming properly, rubbing on tank items as though they itch -- test your water to help find out what's going on. Chances are something bad is spiking. The itching behavior is a strong indicator of high ammonia and they are being burned!\nDwarf seahorses are sensitive to ammonia and nitrites. These levels must be kept down or you will experience loss. Levels can be lowered by performing a 50% water change. Additionally, you can use ammonia/nitrite neutralizing drops to render the substances harmless for a period of time. This is not a long term strategy --more of a band-aid in case you can't perform a water change that moment. Always follow dosage instructions on the bottle and be aware that this stuff stinks (don't spill it)!\nIf you see concerning behavior or your water tests very poorly, I would also suggest removing seahorses from the tank and placing them in a container of brand new prepared water. After a pH flux killed some of my seahorses, I now keep a \"Panic Jar\" of totally brand new salt water near the tank for emergency use. The seahorses who I removed and placed in a simple mason jar of clean saltwater were the ones who survived the crash.\nBefore I add new water to the tank, I like to test it to be sure everything is all good. Freshly mixed water should not contain any ammonia or nitrates. I also make sure that the pH of the water I'm about to add in either matches or is slightly better than the pH currently in the tank. Sudden changes in pH, even changes in a favorable direction, can crash dwarf seahorses. Be VERY careful about using pH adjuster drops available in stores. I would suggest never adding these direct to the tank, but rather add them to a new batch of water which you'll TEST and introduce to the tank incrementally during your next water changes.\nWords of wisdom from the admin of my favorite dwarf forum: \"Don't be a pH chaser. Even if it isn't \"ideal\", if the seahorses look fine and act fine --they're FINE.\"", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3S/Q4S5/JTCRJPCW/F3SQ4S5JTCRJPCW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBJ/OUWQ/JTCRJPBB/FBJOUWQJTCRJPBB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F31/4TH7/JTCRJPBY/F314TH7JTCRJPBY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDC/C9M5/JTCRJPGI/FDCC9M5JTCRJPGI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBU/7J9W/JTCRJPDO/FBU7J9WJTCRJPDO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F17/WULK/JTCRJPEA/F17WULKJTCRJPEA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEW/F5K0/JTCRJPHA/FEWF5K0JTCRJPHA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F96/VDU0/JTCRJPJL/F96VDU0JTCRJPJL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMO/Y5N1/JTCRJPNG/FMOY5N1JTCRJPNG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR2/E7N3/JTCRJPKT/FR2E7N3JTCRJPKT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQW/VS62/JTCRJPPI/FQWVS62JTCRJPPI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZQ/OHY2/JTCRJPQB/FZQOHY2JTCRJPQB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZF/ORFM/JTCRJPQY/FZFORFMJTCRJPQY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFI/NSWB/JTCRJPM5/FFINSWBJTCRJPM5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQR/TA8W/JTCRK97F/FQRTA8WJTCRK97F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ0/DHSJ/JTCRK97Q/FQ0DHSJJTCRK97Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0H/M1JR/JTCRK981/F0HM1JRJTCRK981.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYS/WPA3/JTCRK98O/FYSWPA3JTCRK98O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F67/7926/JTCRK98C/F677926JTCRK98C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP0/7ACH/JTCRK9BG/FP07ACHJTCRK9BG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Water Quality and H2 Uh-Ohs"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "To keep dwarf seahorses you MUST hatch live baby brine shrimp every week. This is not negotiable. Some keepers have luck getting seahorses to eat frozen foods over time, but I would never bank on your whole group converting. Live food moves in a way that catches the eye and ignites a feeding instinct, and your dwarves need to eat a lot to thrive.\nExpect to administer at least 2 feedings per day, 3 if you happen to be home. After you dump in the bbs you want the tank to look like a snow globe for a bit. This ensures there is plenty of food for a whole herd and that seahorses do not have to look far for a bite. This is important, as seahorses are not typically proactive hunters. Even if you think you dumped in a lot, they will eventually snatch up all the shrimp over a day. Seahorses have a very simple digestive system and need to be able to pick up snacks throughout the day since it is a constant \"in one end, out the other\".\nBBS are attracted to light, so provide tank decor at a variety of heights so that seahorses can capture food as it gathers toward the top near your tank light. Just for fun, you can put a mini flashlight near any corner of your tank to draw the bbs over, and any nearby seahorses can enjoy shooting fish in a barrel, as it were.\nYour BBS Hatchery:\nThere are several different hatchery methods, and none terribly expensive. This type uses recycled 2 liter soda bottles and an air pump to hatch a lot at once. I opted for this low maintenance, covered hatchery because its easy use fit well with my busy lifestyle and I was worried my cats might knock over the more elaborate set ups. Your choice of hatchery depends mostly on the space you can dedicate to a hatchery as well as how many mouths you need to feed.Some keepers use a combination method; soda bottles to hatch a lot more bbs, but using the dishes to easily separate bbs from waste.\nIn the photos I have a provided a step by step guide of preparing a hatch in the type that I own.\nBBS hatches in about 24hrs at room temp. Knowing that, it is wise to start your bbs hatching about 2 days before you obtain your dwarves, just in case there's any delay.\nI suggest running 2 hatcheries, slightly offset from each other. If one day something goes wrong and you don't get a good hatch or no hatch at all, hopefully the other dish will provide enough to get by. I start my second hatchery when the first is 3 days in, for a constant supply with no low days.\nDO NOT dump the brine shrimp egg shells in the seahorse tank! You need to separate the live shrimp from the waste/shells before feeding. Egg shells can get stuck in seahorse snouts if inhaled, and also the waste leftover from hatching is just garbage that will mess with water cleanliness. The hatchery I use separates everything automatically (another great selling point) by trapping eggs on an outer rim and requiring the bbs to swim toward the center to access daylight (remember, they are attracted to light). Hatchery methods that use the recycled soda bottle model can also make use of tricking the shrimp with light to herd them to a desired area for harvest. This video is a great example wherein the user sucks up the bbs with a turkey baster, leaving the egg shell waste behind.\nOn good hatch days, put excess in a jar in the fridge. You'll know a strong hatch when you see one, when the the density of shrimp gives a strong pink/orange color. If using the dish, you'll know it is time to start a fresh batch when you are no longer getting the volume and color of a good day. I find by the 4th day the dish is low, hence the need for a secondary hatchery.\nAdd Selcon enricher to your fridge supply to gut load them with essential vitamins and healthy fats the seahorses would otherwise not get. In addition to regular supplementation, this jar can serve as an emergency stash if you experience a poor hatching, what you have a pet sitter use if you're away for a weekend. **BBS only stays reliably alive in the fridge a few days, so use up your enriched food regularly.If the stuff in the jar looks like a bunch of floating fuzz, they're dead and should be thrown out.\nFailure to enrich your brine risks the seahorses eventually dying of malnutrition, even though they're eating. Make enrichment part of your regular process.\nCopedpods are another suitable food for dwarf seahorses, and these naturally contain the healthy fats your Selcon enrichment bestows on bbs. Pods look and move like sea fleas -very jumpy and jerky-- and are sometimes bright red/brown. The color is a reflection of their DHA omega fats. Pods can be purchased in marine aquarium stores or ordered through online vendors like Algae Barn, but they are expensive and not something you'll be thrilled about buying every week. If you have the space to do so, consider culturing your own copepods to have save money and have a steady supply. I'm in the process of trying this, but am still waiting to see if I can get pods to maturity.\nNo matter what organisms you feed to the dwarves, ideally you want to put them through a fine mesh strainer so you're only dumping the food into the tank without bringing a bunch of nasty waste water with them. Once you smell the bbs hatching dish you'll understand why you don't want this funk in your tank. My hatchery dish came with micro mesh ladles for this purpose. If you build a different type of hatchery, you can purchase mesh sieves for copepods and bbs. Some keepers sift away the excess water and give an additional rinse under tap water as well.\nFrozen and Refrigerated Foods -- Don't bank on these becoming a staple, but you can try them. Adults used to a live diet are not likely to convert but there's a chance your own tank raised babies might catch on. It is important to have live food on hand at all times in case your food experiment doesn't work. Larger seahorse species are much more likely to adapt to frozen foods.\nSome keepers report that frozen bbs or frozen baby mysis have been accepted, as well as frozen cyclopods. I have not tried frozen, but I do keep the refrigerated bbs and mix it with the live feeding once in a while to try and introduce it to the babies. It drifts through the water nicely and seems like a reasonable fake, but I think the seahorses notice the lack of twitching and are less stimulated by it. I only have one adult who will readily \"snick\" it out of the water, and anyone else who eats it only does so out of desperation if my live hatch was too thin that day. The lack of success is what motivated me to start a second hatchery so I never come up short on the good stuff.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6B/LOHH/JTCRJPAJ/F6BLOHHJTCRJPAJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF5/JEGI/JTCRJP9Q/FF5JEGIJTCRJP9Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0A/BH2X/JTCRK9B5/F0ABH2XJTCRK9B5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8O/KGZ1/JTENDZGH/F8OKGZ1JTENDZGH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Y/W4ZZ/JTCRK9DX/F8YW4ZZJTCRK9DX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC8/NLIX/JTCRK9C3/FC8NLIXJTCRK9C3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVN/GU5S/JTCRK9CE/FVNGU5SJTCRK9CE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6R/VNPX/JTCRK9BT/F6RVNPXJTCRK9BT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTJ/TZR0/JTCRK9CP/FTJTZR0JTCRK9CP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Z/0V6N/JTCRK9D0/F8Z0V6NJTCRK9D0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMB/F669/JTCRJQ3L/FMBF669JTCRJQ3L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGB/5TJK/JTCRJPRK/FGB5TJKJTCRJPRK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN9/Z9ZH/JTENDZIL/FN9Z9ZHJTENDZIL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F74/BPXF/JTENDZKP/F74BPXFJTENDZKP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F10/EJKH/JTENDZMS/F10EJKHJTENDZMS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXE/6NG8/JTENDZNA/FXE6NG8JTENDZNA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEM/EGGD/JTENDZNB/FEMEGGDJTENDZNB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXA/VRRR/JTENDZOF/FXAVRRRJTENDZOF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F30/LMNZ/JTENDZST/F30LMNZJTENDZST.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEW/UAIY/JTENDZUC/FEWUAIYJTENDZUC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2C/S7Q0/JTCRK9DA/F2CS7Q0JTCRK9DA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: Feeding the Beasts"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "A question I see being asked often is \"What other fish can I keep with dwarf seahorses?\"\nIf you want to succeed...NONE.\nDwarf care is so specific that they are not compatible with most other marine life.

It is lots of fun to watch these rituals! As I stressed earlier, please make sure you are capable of providing for an increased population before getting to this point. If you aren't so sure, purchase all males or all females to start your community.\nYou can tell the genders apart visually.Females have an abdomen that juts in, making a \"P\" shaped body.Males have a more gradual slope due to their pouch, which you could say is a \"D\" shape. I am seeing these shapes apparent in young as early as 6 weeks old.\nMany species of seahorses are monogamous, but that's not 100% of what I'm seeing with my dwarves.\nI have noticed that my breeding age dwarves each have a preferred partner they'll accept regular advances from, but also once in a while will entertain a rando or 2 if they're in the mood. Males, unsurprisingly, are less picky than females and will sometimes try to butt in on someone else's dance.\nIf you observe your dwarves regularly, you will see who is cuddling up to whom, and may notice some preferences. I have one male who only hits on pearly white females. I have another who seems so attracted to bright banana yellow, that if Cleo (yellow female) rejects him, he'll go try to dance for Neener (the yellow male who looks a lot like her).\nBiologically, males should be most attracted to the plump, mature females. They are plump because they are producing eggs. While I do see my curvy girls getting the most attention, that doesn't seem to be the single law of attraction. Neener will only try to court Daria, who is very thin and possibly too young to produce eggs yet. I haven't figured out why he likes only her in particular, other than perhaps she is very identifiable as my only green seahorse.\nThe Courtship Dance -- This usually happens first thing in the morning when the tank lights come on. A male approaches a female and usually tries to hold tails with her. He will then begin to vibrate back and forth in short bursts, trying to get her to reciprocate. The male may change colors (I usually see my darker ones flux to be lighter than normal) and may fill their pouch with water, as if to say 'Hey Gurrrrrl...Those eggs look heavy. Want me to carry them for you in this big awesome pouch I have?\"\nIf the female starts to vibrate back to him, things just got official. A couple will parade around the tank with their tails linked, hopping from spot to spot doing this vibrating dance. They do this several days in a row before any actual mating happens. See my video of female Cleo and male Adam. Don't be discouraged if after a while one of them (usually the female) loses interest and just departs the ritual. Chances are they'll be back at it tomorrow.\nIf you see the female nodding her head up toward the surface, that's the cue you might be in for some real mating. That his her signal to the male. They rise up into the open water away from decorations to do the transfer. The male opens his pouch up and the female uses her ovipositor (it is super weird and just seems to extend out of nowhere) to pour eggs into the pouch. I witnessed this one time but didn't have my camera to film, so if you want to see a transfer check out this video of much larger seahorses gettin' it on.\nNot every physical coupling will result in babies. According to my favorite forum, seahorses will engage in this behavior even just for bonding, so if you don't see any eggs exchanged it was just a fun romp.\nSausage Party Competition -- Doesn't happen often, but I've seen some bickering among males when two are in the mood and interested in the same lady. They may try to run one another off. I have seen them snap at each other or fill their pouches with water and sort of sumo bounce battle. Nobody ever seems to get injured, since there's no real way to bite, but in the end everyone loses because all fighting seems to do is make the female want to leave. Just like people! I rarely intervene unless I happen to see one of my shy guys (Adam or Neener) getting pushed around by a known bully (Preggo and Terry Crews).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F47/FB00/JTCRJQ9M/F47FB00JTCRJQ9M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNN/IOLR/JTENDZIJ/FNNIOLRJTENDZIJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 12: Courtship: \"Heey Guuurrrrllll\""}, {"step": 13, "steps_text": "As with all seahorses, males are the ones who carry the babies. I have no idea why --in the course of evolution-- this one type of fish starting doing things differently, but they did and it is pretty fascinating.\nPeople often ask me: \"So if the male carries the babies...doesn't THAT actually make it the female?\"\nNO.\nThe male is still the male, because he is contributing the sperm component. The female contributes the eggs. Even though the male carries the young to term, the sex cells contributed by the respective genders has not changed.\nOnce an egg transfer has happened, those eggs will be fertilized internally in the male's pouch. Dwarves gestation is only 10-14 days, so they pop out of the oven quickly! You will notice the pouch growing larger over this time. Dad may even start to look downright uncomfortable.\nThe number of babies born will vary. Of the three fathers I've had in my care so far (Terry Crews, Preggo, and Neener), they had 7, 9, and 4, respectively.\nBabies are often born early in the morning when you aren't there to see it, but I was lucky enough to notice Preggo starting his contractions and camped out to watch. The contractions will look like a painful jerking, like he's trying to invert his pouch (which he may be). The birthing process took a lot longer than I expected; about 40 minutes to get all 9 babies out. I believe part of this is because the babies can become entangled in the pouch and then can't be expelled one by one. In my video you'll see a lot of labor and then just one baby tail finally stick out of the pouch opening. A bit later, 3 spilled out at once all wrapped up like a ball of yarn. Males sometimes rub the pouch on tank decor to try and push everything out.\nYou'd think after all that hard labor, a male would not be eager to get pregnant again. You'd be wrong. Males can accept a new batch of eggs within hours of giving birth (there's no guarantee they WILL, but it is possible). Preggo even paused his labor to do a mating dance with his #1 girl, then went back to having those pesky kids.\nWhen first born, the babies are ridiculously tiny. I usually describe them as \"fish turds with eyes\". Don't worry if you don't see them eat on their first day out. They may still have some nourishment left from their yolk. Babies will start eating baby brine shrimp the next day instinctually --no special prompting needed.\nThere is no need to move babies into another tank. Unlike some other fish (I'm looking at you..guppies), dwarf seahorses will not attempt to eat their young. In fact, the adults almost seem to enjoy the babies. You will definitely see them hitched near each other, and sometimes see babies wrapped around adults. There is no aggression towards kids who don't belong to them, and equally there's no indication that the birth father has any special attachment to the young that are his own. The babies can grow up among the adults with no problem as long as there is enough bbs at feeding time. The young grow amazingly in the first month, and reach breeding maturity at around 4 months.\n\nBabies are the most sensitive, due to their size. As such, it is possible you may lose a few along the way if you experience a dip in water quality, or if one just fails to thrive. *If you notice that you have multiple babies dying, test your water immediately and move all babies to the Panic Jar. The tiny guys are essentially the canaries in the coal mine, so if you're losing them then it is a strong indicator of a problem. Check nitrite, ammonia, PH, and nitrate, and perform a partial water change.\n\nI'm enjoying seeing the babies grow up and observing what colors they are becoming. Terry's babies are mostly black but some have strong red patches that may or may not remain into adulthood.

Hope you like it :)\nThis low budget DIY project is about using new but leftover carpet tiles and transform them into a modern looking colourful rug for your home :).\nA lot of stores that sell floor finishings and/or do carpeting projects have a stack of cheap leftover carpet tiles laying around. These leftovers are often a large mix of all sorts and colors so they are not suitable for finishing an entire room anymore. Mostly these never used tiles end up in a dirty garage or shed, they get thrown away or get installed at some place where a super low budget floor finishing is needed and aesthetics is no big deal. In most cases it\u2019s a downgrade of a functional new quality product and that is just a sad thing. Therefore i came up with a simple solution; get rid of the limited pattern possibilities of the standard squares and cut them into different shapes, so the variety of color will become a big plus instead of a problem! :-) this video is the third of a few tutorials i will make about this idea and hopefully you will be inspired to save some carpet tiles and money for your own :) IMPORTANT: Think about your safety! Make sure you are good prepared and use good tools before you begin! Cutting the carpet tiles is a job that you must take serious, because it\u2019s a tough and durable material and needs a lot of force to be cut. Only use rulers that have high edges ( to block the knife from leaving its direction and might hurt your hand ). Don\u2019t do this project alone, for safety reasons. Use sharp blades since this will save a lot of your energy. The blades become blunt easily because of the strong backing of the tiles.", "title": "Recycled DIY Tangram Inspired Modular Carpet", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Recycled-DIY-Tangram-Inspired-Modular-Carpet/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Recipe:\n- 7+ leftover carpet tiles for your tangram carpet, so that every individual part of the tangram puzzle has it\u2019s own colour.

In best case, your ruler or profile has hand grips that make it more easy to put pressure on the tile and stay away from the knife. BE CAREFUL! - 1 thin white marker, i used a Posca fine liner.

For instance, Twin-Tip Sharpies are my writing instrument of choice; however, I only use the Ultra Fine Tip and refuse to use Sharpie\u2019s Ultra Fine Pen because it is simply too skinny. As they are my preferred writing instrument, I usually always have one or a few on my person. Because I usually put them in one of the front pockets of my pants, they sometimes jab me when I sit down in certain positions; which is rather annoying and uncomfortable. I used to carry a Fischer Bullet Space Pen everyday because I would put it in my pocket and never feel it. Fed up with making sacrifices, I decided to modify Sharpie\u2019s Twin Tip and turn it into a real EDC item for myself.\nCriteria:\n- Analogous Size to Fischer\u2019s Space Pen\n- Have a Place to Store the Cap\n- Be a Cost-Effective Modification (i.e. Disposable)\n- Look Stock\n- Retain the Majority of the Ink Cartridge\nThis is a great project to take advantage of the rapid prototyping and cost effectiveness of 3D printing.

It isn\u2019t essential to have a pair of digital calipers with numerical readouts and simultaneous metric to imperial conversions, a simple pair of Vernier calipers will do (even plastic ones ).\nStart by disassembling a sacrificial Twin Tip Sharpie (preferably,one that has dried up ) by firmly grasping the fine tip end (with the cap on ) in one hand and the body of the pen with the other. Slowly start bending the pen at the seam where the cap meets the body back and forth with firm pressure. Once the seal is broken, keep bending whilst pulling on the capped end until it becomes dislodged from the body of the pen. This might take some practice, but it is the best separation technique that I\u2019ve found. Then, tip the pen body upside down over a piece of paper on a table and tap it until the cartridge falls out.\nNext, take careful measurements of the inner and outer diameter of the base of the tip that was removed, and the ridges found along its shaft. Measure the distances between the ridges, as well as, the overall length of the base of the tip that was inserted into the body of the pen (up to the cap ).\nMy measurements were as follows, overall length: 13mm; diameter of the shaft: 10mm; diameter of the ridges: 10.5mm; distance of first ridge from base: 6mm; distance of second ridge from base: 10mm; wall thickness: 1.25mm.\nOnce you have these measurements, you can start 3D modelling!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGE/1DFF/JTIYH1DB/FGE1DFFJTIYH1DB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F78/MYTJ/JTIYH1DI/F78MYTJJTIYH1DI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1H/69I2/JTIYH1DJ/F1H69I2JTIYH1DJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA6/P836/JTIYH1DK/FA6P836JTIYH1DK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA5/EIVL/JTIYH1DL/FA5EIVLJTIYH1DL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3A/54UK/JTIYH1DT/F3A54UKJTIYH1DT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHQ/5W3R/JTIYH1E8/FHQ5W3RJTIYH1E8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5O/3ZAH/JTIYH1FK/F5O3ZAHJTIYH1FK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCG/8XG6/JTIYH1G3/FCG8XG6JTIYH1G3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Measure Twice Print Once\u2026"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "As I mentioned in the intro, the simple geometric shape of this part allows us to use perhaps the most intuitive, free, browser-based software available, Tinkercad. If you don\u2019t already have a Tinkercad account, create one and follow the tutorials to become familiar with the software. Once you are acquainted, dive in with your measurements and start modelling!\nRemember that there are countless approaches to creating a 3D model, the more experienced you become, the more efficient your modelling process will become. To make this tutorial as accessible as possible I chose to eliminate using the tube shape tool to create the body as it requires tube calculations that can be daunting for those with strengths that don\u2019t include math. This 3D modeled part is made up of only 8 shapes!\n*To follow the criteria of making it look stock, I changed the colour of the pieces to black. You can simply leave it the default colours or change the colour to any that you prefer!\nStart by using the cylinder tool to create a cylinder that is 10mm in diameter by 13mm tall. Next, create a cylinder that is 10.5mm in diameter by 0.5mm tall and duplicate it. Then, elevate one of the 10.5mm x 0.5mm cylinders to 6mm and then the other to 10mm. Select all three cylinders by holding down the shift key and press \u2018\u2019L\u2019\u2019 to bring up the Align Tool. Align the pieces in the center of both the X and Y axes. You\u2019ll find that the Align Tool is indispensable when modelling. To complete the shaft, create a cylinder, using the cylinder hole tool, that is 8.75mm in diameter by 13mm tall. Align it with the three other cylinders in the same way as the previous step and Group all the cylinders together. This will create a hole in the center of the shaft and a wall thickness of 1.25mm.\nNow, we must create a stopper piece for the top of the shaft to catch on the body of the pen. Start by creating a cylinder 12mm in diameter and 1mm tall. Elevate the cylinder to 13mm and Align and Group it to the others. To round off the profile of the top of the cylinder (purely aesthetic ), use the hemisphere tool to create a hemisphere that is 12mm in diameter by 0.50mm tall. Elevate the hemisphere to 14mm, Align and Group it with the others. The piece is now fully functional but doesn\u2019t meet the criteria of cap storage.\nTo remedy this, we\u2019ll add a couple more cylinders and a hemisphere to the top based on the internal dimensions of the fine tip cap. First, create a cylinder that is 9mm in diameter by 1.5mm tall, then Elevate it to 14mm, Align and Group it to the other pieces. Next, create another cylinder that is 9.25mm in diameter by 0.5mm tall, Elevate it to 15.5mm, Align and Group it to the other pieces.

The table was heavy, sturdy, large, and it would serve it's purpose, but it was UGLY. I call it an old granny style tile top table. We were just covering it with table cloths to hide the ugly, but the table cloths kept getting pulled and were constantly slipping too far to one side or another, so we were always needing to fix it. We are a big board game family so we play games at this table often and it gets annoying dealing with wrinkles in the cloth as well.\n\nSo we decided to rip out the tile and replace it with something else. I started thinking about what we should do in it's place. We love anime, video games, and board games so I had to choose a character or theme for the table. Since it was tile, I was thinking along those lines, which made me think pixels, which of course led to Mario.\n\nBut first, we have to tear out the ugly to make room for the awesome. First we pulled off the trim, which got broken in the process so we will need to replace that later. We used a hammer and a scraper to pry up and remove the tile. Then used an orbital sander to sand it down and remove the excess glue. The sander couldn't quite remove all the glue so we bought a sheet of plywood cut to size and glued it on as a new top.

I googled 8 bit Mario images and found the image attached. I liked it because the colors are vibrant and it has many Mario elements in it.\nThen figure out what scale you will use. Measure the table and the image. I decided on a quarter inch for my squares. At that scale, the squares are pretty small and I didn't want to go any smaller. The image was too large to fit the entire thing at a quarter inch scale so I had to crop the image. I chose a section that had several of the Mario characters and was visually compelling and balanced.\n\nNext I started drawing out the image on graph paper, which is perfect because the squares are quarter inch. This let's you see exactly how big the characters and all will be. I started with Mario. Count the pixels from top to bottom and left to right. Make sure there are at least that many squares on the graph paper. If there aren't enough, you need to tape multiple sheets together. Choose a place to start, I started at the bottom left, and begin drawing the character on the graph paper. It's all squares so you just have to draw over the existing lines, easy peasy. I colored in the black squares with my pencil as I went which helps you keep track of where you are, it can get confusing with no point of reference. When you finish, color in the squares the appropriate colors and count them as you go so you know how many of each color you will need. Then cut him out and set him aside.\n\nI continued with the other elements: the yellow blocks, the brown block, the cacti, goombas, bullet bill, and the vine.\n\nNext, I taped several sheets of graph paper together until I had a large sheet the size of my table. Then I counted pixels and drew on the land: the strip across the bottom and the 2 cliffs. Once I had those to use as reference, I placed and taped down the characters and things I already made. Last, I drew in the clouds. Remember to color and count all the squares.\n\n\nI took the image to the craft store and used it to find sheets of foam in the right colors. I had to compromise on some colors since the array of choices isn't that extensive. The foam is sold in many sizes. Take the dimensions and multiply by 4 to know how many squares you can get from it. *Note, not all the squares will be usable. Some get cut off or squished by the cricut wheels that pull the paper in.* They also come adhesive backed or regular. I had to get both kinds to get all the colors.\n\nI made a grid in Photoshop and used the cricut to cut the squares. It takes forever! Like 4 to 5 hours for a full sheet. I attached here several grid images. One is a normal sheet size, one for a large sheet, and one for 2 small sheets.\n\n**Note: after having finished this project, I got a Glowforge laser printer and tried cutting the squares on it. It is SO much faster but it melts some of the foam away so you end up with slightly smaller squares.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQC/E3KP/JTEMYXLH/FQCE3KPJTEMYXLH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2Y/FV53/JSSUOS6T/F2YFV53JSSUOS6T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4Q/212U/JSUP0Z1H/F4Q212UJSUP0Z1H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGL/WJP0/JSUP0YAV/FGLWJP0JSUP0YAV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F74/ZB6E/JTEMYXKU/F74ZB6EJTEMYXKU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJK/VR30/JTEMYXLA/FJKVR30JTEMYXLA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNG/319N/JTEMYXPY/FNG319NJTEMYXPY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIO/D2KT/JTEMYXLG/FIOD2KTJTEMYXLG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGP/S16C/JTEMYXMN/FGPS16CJTEMYXMN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Plan It Out"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Now the tedious part begins.\nI started with the bottom right corner of the table, the ground/cliff. Gather the colors you will be working with.\n\nI found that the cricut didn't quite cut all the way through the foam and that turned out beneficial. This allowed me to cut large sections of squares to place instead of having to lay each one individually. So I marked out sections of squares on the plan and then cut them out of the foam. *Note: don't do very large sections. The foam isn't perfectly exact in size and I found that sometimes the larger sections don't fit right. Sometimes you have to stretch the foam to make it fill the area correctly. I recommend sections in squares when you can do it: 2x2, 3x3, 4x4. Also, definitely don't do long single wide strips. They stretch as you peel off the adhesive backing and it throws it off*\n\nThen just start sticking the foam to the table. I used DAP rapid fuse super glue for the foam with no adhesive backing.

I started off by filling in the sky blue from the edge of the right cliff over to the left until I got to the point where the goomba started.\n*Note: the only blue foam the craft store had that was close enough to the color I need for the sky was a glitter sheet. The back of it did not have any glitter. I didn't want to ruin my cricut mat with the glitter so I cut the sheets glitter side up, which meant that I had to lay all the sky squares one at a time since the cut lines weren't visible from the non glitter side. As you can imagine, that sucked! I recommend using an old cricut mat that already has lost it's stickiness and duck taping the foam on glitter side down. It's a pain, and if you don't tape it well enough, the foam will move while cutting, but at least then you can lay squares in chunks.*\n\nTo lay the sky squares: lay out several squares glitter side down, squirt a thin line of glue about 10 squares long, use a mechanical pencil with no lead to gently push down on a square and drag it into place in the glue. Work quickly since the glue dries fast.\n\n*Note: placing the sky first helped me place the goomba, but later I didn't like the way that section to the right of the goomba looked in comparison to the section to the left of the second goomba. The space on the right somehow ended up being larger than the squares could fill keeping to neat rows and columns while the space on the left was too small. I had to space out the squares on the right and squish tightly the ones on the left. You can see in the picture the difference I am talking about. The tightly packed section looks SO much better. So later on in the project, I ended up ripping off that section on the right and redoing it with tighter packed squares. You just have to let go of trying to keep them all in neat rows and columns and just fill it in.*\n\nWith that in mind, it would be much quicker and less fuss to just start with the bottom of the goomba, counting pixels to get to the correct position and start building him upwards. Try to keep those pixels in neat rows and columns since those are noticable if they aren't.\n\nI worked until I had all of it filled up to the top of the land: the question block, 3 cacti, and 2 goombas.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCP/T10C/JSSUORRK/FCPT10CJSSUORRK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWU/EZ5O/JSSUORXR/FWUEZ5OJSSUORXR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEK/0CMM/JSUP0YK6/FEK0CMMJSUP0YK6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNG/DEL6/JSSUORAJ/FNGDEL6JSSUORAJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIW/BAKJ/JSSUORMQ/FIWBAKJJSSUORMQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV7/T8OM/JSSUORL0/FV7T8OMJSSUORL0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRC/HAV1/JSUP0YSO/FRCHAV1JSUP0YSO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8S/BF1P/JSSUOSC4/F8SBF1PJSSUOSC4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Keep It Going"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Now we are to Mario and the line of blocks.

So the resin over flowed the right side and didn't completely cover the left. We hadn't ordered more resin so we had to let that completely cure and ordered more. But before it cures you have to pop all the air bubbles like I said before, that's why we tried to seal it first to help lessen the bubbles. I went around with a heat gun 3 separate times popping bubbles but they just kept coming! We should have poured a super thin layer of resin first to seal the wood under the foam and then poured the full layer. But we didn't because we didn't have that much resin. Mistake number 2.\n\nThen lightly sand the whole thing, mix up more resin and pour it. We thought: we used a gallon the first time and seemed like it would have been enough if the table had been level. We only need to fill in half the table and have a thin layer over the rest so a half gallon should suffice. And here we made our 3rd mistake. It was not enough resin. It was spread so thin on the right side that it had ripples and distortions from us trying to spread it.\n\nAgain with the sanding and mixing another batch. Again we thought: we just did a half gallon and it filled in that whole section we needed. Now we only need a thin layer over the whole thing so a half gallon should be more than enough and it should over flow all sides like it is supposed to do to self level. And here was the fourth mistake! It was not enough resin! It covered everything but did not overflow. So it didn't self level very well. There are tiny dimples in places. But that isn't too bad, the bad part is that we had people over earlier in evening and they left the door open alot, which let in bugs, which committed suicide in the resin. We circled the table for 10 mins after pouring, picking out bugs with tweezers. We had to leave it alone since it was setting and more stupid bugs with death wishes found their way into it. Now we have to decide if it is worth it to dig them out and put more resin, which obviously we suck at.\nSo for now we are leaving it until we decide it's worth it.\n\nBut it is done and it looks great. If you don't already know where the stupid bug is, you won't see it.\n\nThanks for checking out my Mario table instructable and I appreciate any votes you want to throw my way in the contests.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F47/Q3G3/JSSUOSBE/F47Q3G3JSSUOSBE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOH/RXEB/JT2SLCU9/FOHRXEBJT2SLCU9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGD/24T5/JT2SLCT2/FGD24T5JT2SLCT2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9A/8EIQ/JSSUORGN/F9A8EIQJSSUORGN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Resin"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 10:"}], "channel": "Decorating"}, {"category": "Home", "description": "Hi! in this tutorial we will learn how to make a cute Polaroid photo frame for tea perfect to carry in any pocket.

Its easier to install if you get your screws started before you place it on the frame. That way when you're holding it up you won't fumble around with screws and drop them. Start from the top and work your way down.\nMove to the front and cut siding for it. A lot of pallet boards are the same width of 2x4s so that makes it pretty simple. Do the same for the other side then cut a piece to fit the top and bottom.\nPick up a piece of .5\"x.5\" trim and stain it (if desired) and use it to cover the gap between the side of the closet and the front. I used a caulk gun and construction adhesive to attach it only because I didn't have my nail gun with me and I really wanted to keep the project moving forward.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWS/II2W/JSYZBLNE/FWSII2WJSYZBLNE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5V/89QK/JSYZBLNH/F5V89QKJSYZBLNH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE3/K6PO/JSYZBLNK/FE3K6POJSYZBLNK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0D/WKQQ/JSYZBLNL/F0DWKQQJSYZBLNL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQZ/1U6S/JSYZBLOB/FQZ1U6SJSYZBLOB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9F/28DN/JSYZBLOH/F9F28DNJSYZBLOH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F78/VLI8/JSYZBLOG/F78VLI8JSYZBLOG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8B/AFA6/JSYZBLPR/F8BAFA6JSYZBLPR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1A/I1GZ/JSYZBLOD/F1AI1GZJSYZBLOD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLQ/8N2P/JSYZBLJK/FLQ8N2PJSYZBLJK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDG/5GOE/JSYZC8T6/FDG5GOEJSYZC8T6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY0/14DZ/JSYZC8T7/FY014DZJSYZC8T7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5R/I8E0/JSYZC8T8/F5RI8E0JSYZC8T8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTP/3HPJ/JSYZC8TA/FTP3HPJJSYZC8TA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Cut Your Siding to Fit and Install"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "Measure the space for you door.

I'm using .3/4\" x 2 1/2\" (1x3) \"select pine\" for the door frame and I want a 1.75\" overlap on the sides which means that my door frame will end up being 36.5\" x 79.5\". I put a piece of 1/2\" scrap wood on the floor and measured from there so the door won't end up getting stuck on the carpet.\nCut two vertical pieces (called a stile when building cabinets) @ 79.5\" and two horizontal pieces (called rails) at 31.5\". The top of my doorframe will overlap just a little less than the other sides because the clearance with the light fixture is so close. Drill pocket holes in the horizontal pieces and attach them to the verticals. Use a clamp to hold them in place, this will help keep them flush. Once all sides are connected, place the door frame next to your closet and make sure it fits.\nUsing a router to cut an indent to place a panel:\nInstall the rabbeting bit and set your depth. I went half way through but should have added in an additional 1/8\" so I would have some room when I added in some pieces to hold the panel in place. When cutting rabbet joints, have your router facing forward and have the lumber to the left of the bit and move forward. Cut the rabbet all the way around the inside of the frame.

You could also make your router cuts deeper and use strips of wood, such as .5\"x6\" boards. Cut the sheet to fit into the grooves that were routed.\nThis was the real fun part for me. This is a mural I painted in 2015 for an installation at a gallery but since it came down its been sitting in storage. Although lightweight, its big and I've been wanting to repurpose it for a long time and with this project I finally found that opportunity. I first placed my frame on a couple different panels to see which composition I wanted to use. I decided on the second one. I then measured the dimensions inside of the frame and cut my panel to size. I trimmed the corners at a 45 so it would slide into the frame nicely.\nHow to paint a mural:\nMurals are fun to make and don't have to be complicated to look good. For this one, I did a drawing first, scanned it, and then used a sharpie and a projector to get my image onto the panels. You can also freehand it, which takes more time but is a good skill to have, or use a grid. If you use the grid method first measure your surface and figure out the proportions between that and your drawing. As easy example would be if you're going to paint on a 4'x8' piece of plywood have your original drawing be 4\"x8\" and draw a grid in 1\" intervals. On the panel, makes the grid in 1' intervals. The use your original drawing as a reference and draw it on the panel one square at a time.\nPainting on a piece of plywood is a great way to become familiar with the mural painting process in many regards and I highly recommend it for anyone who is looking to get into this medium.\n\nFor paint I use either spray paint such as IronLak, Flame, MTN 94, or Montana Gold or I use bucket paint. If you go to any of the big box home improvement stores you can get 8oz paint samples for around $3.50 and use those to paint, or buy quarts and gallons and mix as needed. The benefit of the 8oz samples is that its affordable to buy multiple colors and then you can get your colors right without mixing and accidentally making the wrong color. I do a fair amount of color mixing for some projects but for others its nice to just have the colors and focus on getting the job done. If you've never painted a mural before, consider focusing on a design that uses 5 colors that work well together and try that. Adobe Kuler is a free tool that is great for figuring out balanced color schemes. Most places can't match paint to Pantones but if you print your color scheme and match it to swatches you'll be sitting pretty. Of course, this is all based on what your particular style is, but this is a good place to start to get familiar with the materials and scale.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMF/Y68V/JSYZCPT5/FMFY68VJSYZCPT5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5B/8Q9D/JSYZCPTD/F5B8Q9DJSYZCPTD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FET/MT7E/JT91RRT1/FETMT7EJT91RRT1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCS/TB4D/JT91RRUJ/FCSTB4DJT91RRUJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9M/NIB7/JT91RGZ2/F9MNIB7JT91RGZ2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK7/FXV6/JSYZCPW2/FK7FXV6JSYZCPW2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGS/LQO6/JT91RGR0/FGSLQO6JT91RGR0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3X/TGZQ/JTEMWWEB/F3XTGZQJTEMWWEB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F74/13TI/JTEMWWHF/F7413TIJTEMWWHF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA5/BHAS/JTEMWWOQ/FA5BHASJTEMWWOQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF5/U2G2/JTEMWWRF/FF5U2G2JTEMWWRF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 11: Cut a Panel for the Door/how to Paint a Mural"}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "I wasn't planning on buying this concealed hinge jig (or European style hinge as they're also referred to) but ended up getting it because I have another cabinet project after this and will have to install 8 more hinges, so I decided it would be worth it. In addition, I come this far with the build and really didn't want to accidentally drill through my frame and have to buy more lumber and build it again. You can install the hinges without it but just make sure to be super careful that you don't accidentally drill all the way though your frame.\nThe gray screws adjust how far the hinge will sit from the edge. I set mine to 3mm at the advice of the instructions. I then placed the jig on the frame and checked to make sure that I wouldn't drill through the frame. From what I found is that standard cabinets have hinges placed 3.5\" from the top and bottom, so I lined up the jig with the ruler on the side and then clamped it down. Attach the bit and begin drilling.\nUse a really thin bit (I apologize, I forget what size drill bit I used) for the small holes on either side of the large hole. I put the bit into the hole first and made sure it was the same depth before I drilled it. Once the small holes are done, use a larger bit so you can add the plastic inserts. Take a larger bit (5/8 I think) and use tape to mark the depth, and then drill into the small holes. Insert the plastic parts and use a hammer to get them all the way in if they won't go, but be gentle. Place the hinge in its spot and use the small screws to attach it.

However, many are crafted in wood, and almost all are solid. I was curious to not only create a custom profile - but a custom hardness also. This required me to work in a polymer, Sugru to get the desired result. I think this is quite an unconventional REMIX, and hope you'll vote if you are inspired to do other personalised projects out of polymers!\nWhat if products were designed for everyone - but had tailored elements to fit you personally?\nWHY BESPOKE?\nMany consumer products are designed for the '95th percentile' - i.e. the majority of people, but although this works pretty well for things like toothbrushes, which are unlikely to justify bespoke design/manufacture, (being disposable and cheap), but for tools and other items which become personal possessions for many years, perhaps there is an exception to be made?\nOne option would be to to make a 100% bespoke knife, but few of us have the cash or even ability to design an entire knife from scratch. So I wanted to make a bespoke grip to my hand.\nADVENTURES IN SHORE-A HARDNESS\nThis project is aimed at people who like custom gear and materials. It's a bit niche, so not for everyone, but I've shared a lot of these tips and for those who need to sculpt and shape things, so thought it might be useful to share here at Instructables, perhaps as an exercise in learning how to prototype in different grades of rubber/polymeric materials. If you take a company such as JosephJoseph, (who uses silicone rubbers extensively) one can quickly appreciate that being able to prototype - and specify technical design details like this, is effective in terms of cost and time, and of course allows for more user testing without having to produce expensive moulding tools.\nCREATIVE LINKS\nTo be clear, I did work for Sugru, but I did this sort of exploratory work in my free time, examples include (Oyster Card Hacks (LINK), Wireless Charging SatNavs, etc. in my other Instructables). My views are my own, and you attempt anything here at your own risk.", "title": "Designed by Touch: a Dual Polymer Knife Handle", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Designed-by-Touch-a-Dual-Polymer-Knife-Handle/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Handle-less Knives\nI was lucky to be able to source an 'un-finished' knife from knife makers TOG*, which had a tiny defect (they are perfectionists - love it!). However, as this was luck on my part and TOG does not commonly do this, the suggested alternative, would be to:\na. Buy a blade from a company such as F.Dick http://www.dick.de/en/special-tools/catalogues/\nb. Buy a finished knife and remove the handle by inserting a saw blade between the 'Tang' (see diagram) and the wooden/plastic handle, and saw it from the surface, before grinding the adhesive away. Then you'd start from the same point as myself.\n*Blade kindly supplied by TOG Knives.\nSafe Working\nThe \"Swivel-Vice\" is a valuable item if you have it (typically around $15-$20), as it will allow you to work at a multitude of angles - while keeping the blade not pointing towards you (or in the direction you are working). Please cover the blade with a cover at all times when working, it is all too easy to injure oneself when focused on a detail of the handle, and then absent-mindedly knock into the blade. You have been warned.\nVariable Shore-A Hardness of Handles\nSugru Softener is an additive which reduces the Shore-A Hardness of Sugru from 70 (bike type) as low as 45 (elastic band). It is not widely available, as is in beta-testing. Similar results can be achieved by either using different modelling putties, (Green Stuff, Fimo, etc) or by adding Blu-Tac to Sugru.

It's hard to keep spices organized in a cabinet! I looked around for one, but didn't find anything I really liked, so I figured \"I'm a craftswoman, why don't I just MAKE ONE?\" I found this excellent tutorial demonstrating how to make a Lazy Susan spice rack, and decided to follow the tutorial with a couple small changes: while the tutorial used store lumber cut into a circle, I used a \"natural circle\" from a 80+ year old mossy oak that fell on our property during the recent storms. I couldn't stand to let such a noble tree just lay there and rot, so I gave it new life as this spice rack. I also made the entire top of the rack available for spices, instead of making it a replica of the bottom. I enjoyed the process and result so much I have now made several of these live edge spice racks.\nHere's the video tutorial I followed:\nThese are the general steps from the video (he uses much cooler toys-I mean TOOLS-than I used, but they're not necessary):\nCut 3 Wood Circles from sheet lumber\nDesign and drill holes for spices (also drill hole for center dowel)\nSand holes using Dremel, sand wood slices, including circle edges\nCut and sand dowel for center\nVarnish the wood\nAdd dowel with glue and special leveling clamp\nAdd base/Lazy Susan and rubber bumpers\nThese are the general steps I follow:\nGet 2 live edge wood slices\nDesign and drill holes for spices\nSand holes using Dremel, sand wood slices, add slightl bevel to hole edges, *don\u2019t* sand bark off edges!\nCut and sand dowel for center\nVarnish the wood\nAdd dowel with glue and screws\nCut base, add base/lazy susan and no slip pad.\nI hope you enjoy this tutorial!

As live edge wood isn't usually a perfect circle, I use a spice jar and drew the pattern onto the wood.\nFor the bottom tier I start in one place approximately 1/4\" from the edge of the bark and trace the jar, then move directly across from it, trace again. I divide the wood into quarters in this way, like folding a circle of paper in half, in quarters, then in eighths. For the bottom of the spice rack, there should be at least 1/4\" between each circle and each circle should be about 1/4\" from the edge of the bark.\nFor the top tier, I trace one circle about 1/4\" from the edge of the bark, then trace overlapping circles the rest of the way around the wood slice. I'm also going to drill out that center part, so it can be a little messy.\nI use the drill press and 2\" Forster bit to drill the holes, about half way through the wood slice, as Makify shows. I line up the bit with my template circles and go at it. Go slowly, especially if the wood is still a little wet/unseasoned! The bottom tier is definitely the easier of the two in this case. For the top, after I have drilled all the circles around the edges, I go back and drill out the center space, using the drill press and Forster bit.

I add the varnish until it looks like clear glass sitting on top of or bonded to the wood. Every part of the wood needs to be thickly coated in varnish, including the edges with the bark. I use an old toothbrush to gently brush off the bark, and then varnish over everything that doesn't come off with the toothbrush. This preserves the \"mossy\" part of the mossy oak. Normally, the bark only takes 3 coats of varnish before I'm happy with it, but it's the hardest part because it can get messy quickly!\nI use a plain old \"children's art\" paintbrush from Walmart, and throw it away once I'm done with the project.

The depth needed to be equivalent to the clothes currently hanging, and the other shelves and bins already in the closet. And the height also needed to be similar as the plastic drawers already in the closet, so clothes on hangers could clear it. My wife also wanted me to incorporate cedar to help with storing of out-of-season clothing, and it had to have drawers (not shelves).\nI was originally considering using 48\"x48\"x1/4\" cedar plywood for the bottom of each shelf (available as special order from Home Depot). The cost was a tad higher (but still reasonable) but further inspection of the reviews made me seek an alternative (looses the cedar scent, cracks easily, and the thickness doesn't match other 1/4\" plywood). I opted to use more standard birch plywood and just line that with cedar planks.

Somewhere in the middle I am supposed to teach them about reproductive methods of organisms and the resultant genetic diversification of life (yes, with 13 year old kids). One of the best, and least awkward, ways to teach reproductive methods is through the investigation of plants. Looking at plants that can reproduce asexually (maternity plant, cacti, garlic, strawberry, etc...) and plants that reproduce sexually (all angiosperms - flowers) gives the students a much clearer picture and totally (well almost) removes the awkward nature of the curriculum.\nMany kids love the idea of dissecting something, but there are a good number that definitely rather not put a scalpel into a formaldehyde preserved animal. Dissecting a flower doesn't quite have the cringe factor and it allows the students to see all of the inner workings of a sexually reproducing organism. No matter which way you slice it (sorry for the pun) there is still sperm and egg involved with angiosperm reproduction.\nWhat follows is a step by step process for completing this lab in the classroom with a wide range of ages. I teach it to seventh grade students but you could easily modify it for upper elementary up through eighth grade. I have included all of the activity sheets with this Instructable along with details and explanations on how to run the activity. We used alstroemeria flowers with the lab since they are readily available at our local grocery store and are pretty easy to work with and to identify all of the parts. We used simple equipment to conduct the dissection; magnifying lenses, tweezers, sharp scissors, and transparent tape.", "title": "Tear It Up and Tape It - Middle School Flower Dissection Lab", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Tear-It-Up-and-Tape-It-Middle-School-Flower-Dissec/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Ultimately the goal is for students to identify how flowers act as a sexually reproductive structure allowing flowering plants (angiosperms) to reproduce and continue that plant's specific genetic qualities. With the lab the students will be exploring each component of the flower and identifying the reproductive structures within it. It is wise to do some preliminary work with the students identifying various forms of reproduction and discussing the various structures involved in flower reproduction.\nI have included for your use my lesson plan that I wrote specifically for dissecting alstroemeria flowers. You should access each of the following documents (they are Google Drive based and are open for anyone to view):\nFlower Dissection Lab Packet (includes introduction, flower dissection instructions and taping areas, and focus questions for the end of the lab)\nDissecting Alstroemeria Hints Presentation (gives some helpful hints on how to identify the specific parts of these flowers)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLU/A5I1/JSUP15VU/FLUA5I1JSUP15VU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7Y/1ZMU/JSUP15VX/F7Y1ZMUJSUP15VX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Getting Prepped - How Do Flowers Turn Into a Fruit With Seeds on the Inside?"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I make containers (old salad containers or Trader Joe's animal cracker bins) available for each table with the following materials in it (typically there are enough for one per student):\nScissors and/or dissecting knife (depends on the class)\nTweezers\nMagnifying lenses\nTransparent tape (one per table is fine)\nI don't hand these materials out until we have reviewed the lab directions and the students have gone through the entire lab to identify their jobs. I then hand out the lab packet and read through the entire front page with the class going through all of the details on how these flowers specifically can reproduce. You can have the students highlight key points, especially those that connect to identifying the correct components and will help with the final focus questions.\nNext I hand out one Alstroemeria flower to each student and tell them to hold off on the dissection. Using the Google Slides presentation I provided, I go through each part of the flower so that the students can more easily identify the components of alstroemeria during the actual dissection. Things such as the sepal being fused to the back of the petal can cause confusion due to the previous activities involving flowers with non-fused sepals.\nOnce you feel confident that the students are ready to begin the dissection, hand out the bucket of materials to each table and have the students begin working on the lab. I usually go around the room to make sure that each student is placing the correct part in the boxes provided. They should use tape to cover the entire part if they want to preserve it. Also, when it comes to dissecting the ovary, it is best to use a dissecting knife, pallet knife, or other sharp-edged tool. Scissors do work but make sure they are decent enough to cut up the center of the stem and through the ovary.\nOnce the student is finished with the dissection portion of the lab they should begin working on the conclusion questions. There are a couple that I wrote that really do take some time to think through. so encourage the kids to try their best on them and apply all of what they have learned about flower pollination and to use the front of the lab packet for assistance.\nAs for grading, I use a standards-based grading system that I developed for my class and use for all assignments and assessments. You will see it on the very last page. I believe that this grading system creates goals that are clear and easily accessed by the students. It also makes grading assignments less subjective for the teacher and provides clearer feedback for the students to see where they need to improve. Coupled with this grading system I use a token system allowing the students to cash in up to three tokens per quarter to improve their work on assignments and assessments... maybe I will have to write another instructable on my grading system?", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FEY/8DW5/JSUP16Z3/FEY8DW5JSUP16Z3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCV/L1FA/JSUP16Z6/FCVL1FAJSUP16Z6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1K/LTOQ/JSUP190G/F1KLTOQJSUP190G.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Conducting the Lab"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "\"While we teach, we learn\" - Seneca (Roman philosopher 4 BC to 65 AD)\nWe are lucky to have our elementary school within a quick walk to our middle school. The opportunities to collaborate between the two schools are endless and we have taken advantage of a number of instances to help further our own student's understandings through teaching the younger students. Both party's benefit immensely from the interaction and it is fantastic to see our student's take full ownership of the work they do.\nOnce my students are proficient with flower reproduction I tell them that they are not going to be tested on their understanding in the normal, summative manner but instead will be tested through their ability to teach. I have the students get into groups of between two and three students and then hand out this sheet to each of them. We discuss the components of a good lesson plan (i.e. pre-assessment, models, etc...) listed on the first page and then talk about the standards for second grade students in the state of Massachusetts, listed on the back. Groups are then given the challenge to design a full lesson plan used to teach a small group of second grade students about the purpose and function of flowers.\nI tell the students that I will provide a pre and post assessment to their second grade students so that they will have some sort of gauge on how effective their lesson plan was. I also give the disclaimer that they cannot rely only on this summative assessment to determine what their students do and don't know about the topic. I try to connect this to the current drive in public schools for standardized tests, and how they determine so much for both students and educators. I typically deliver the pre-assessments to the second grade teachers a week or two before they are set to come down for the lessons.\nStudents are then given approximately three class periods (50 minutes each) to create and develop their lesson plans. As you can see from the pictures, the students are extremely creative and come up with some fantastic ideas to teach their students the purpose and function of flowers on angiosperms. These lessons will typically take 40 minutes to complete and do require some decent coordination between the two schools, but they are worth their weight in gold. I have seen students who were somewhat unenthusiastic throughout the entire school year come to life through the process of making the lesson plans and especially when initiating them. You see those kids who have a future in teaching right off the bat and it's refreshing to see your students in a different light.\nAs a summarization of the entire process and as a reflection of what was learned I have students complete a student reflection page. While the kids are teaching I go around the room and take pictures of them working with their students. I then print those photos off so that they can paste them onto their student reflection sheet. The post-assessments are completed a day or two after the second grade students complete the lessons and I pick them up when they are ready. My students will then compare the pre and post assessments and look for where they can find summative growth while keeping in mind that it is only on portion of the entire puzzle.\nThis is one of my favorite lessons of the year and I hope that you will find a way to incorporate it into your curriculum.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F53/HVZ2/JSUP16ZO/F53HVZ2JSUP16ZO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMG/GE8W/JT2SLRON/FMGGE8WJT2SLRON.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLP/P1P4/JSUP16YC/FLPP1P4JSUP16YC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHG/H3BA/JSUP16ZD/FHGH3BAJSUP16ZD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6D/K22J/JSUP16ZI/F6DK22JJSUP16ZI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKL/AS48/JT2SLWOM/FKLAS48JT2SLWOM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7Q/EJ98/JT2SLWRM/F7QEJ98JT2SLWRM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXY/BXZJ/JT2SLWTO/FXYBXZJJT2SLWTO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Taking It to Another Level - Teaching Is the Key to Learning"}], "channel": "Education"}, {"category": "Home", "description": "There are many solutions for organizing a closet full of hats such as this one.

Some children with microcephaly lead normal lives, but others experience delayed cognitive development and need daily care. At 12 years old, Rebekah can't speak or feed herself, but her smile and her laugh still light up the room wherever she goes.\nBecause she has trouble swallowing, Rebekah has a feeding tube, and with her child-like curiosity, she likes to grab and pull things that capture her attention (like her feeding tube). A few Christmases ago, my aunt asked if I could make something that would keep Rebekah from disconnecting her feeding tube while she's eating, and now I'm finally able to do that!\nMy goal for this instructable is not only to show how I made something for Rebekah but also to teach others how to solve similar problems of their own. Maybe they'll create instructables too, and the world will be a better place!\nHere's the process we'll walk through together:\nDefine the Problem - A disconnected feeding tube means a big mess and a hungry belly!\nCollect Information - What's out there?

My aunt and uncle have a lot on their minds already - medication schedules, equipment maintenance, specialized transportation needs, and much more! If I'm going to add something else into their lives, it needs to be beneficial, simple, and very low maintenance.\nHere's my list of qualities I wanted my solution for Rebekah to have:\nKeeps her feeding tube connection safe and secure\nEasy to wash and sanitize\nFast and easy to replace if needed\nTough enough to stand up to daily use for a while (my goal is 6 months)\nAssembles and disassembles quickly and easily\nAllows for one-handed operation with hands of any size\nEasy to open and close\nSelf-explanatory so that anyone can use it\nAdaptable to a wide range of needs", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKO/B9JM/JSYZ8GGP/FKOB9JMJSYZ8GGP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Define the Problem - Vulnerable Feeding Tube Connection"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Once I had an idea of what a good solution for Rebekah would look like, I started researching existing solutions for her problem.

Mark's daughter Corissa has a feeding tube, and he designed the Corisafe to keep the connection safe and clean. A CoriSafe is $25 or $20 if you buy more than one.\nSewn G-Tube Covers (on Etsy and Amazon) - These covers are made of fabric and snap together to cover the feeding tube connection.\nNeither of these solutions worked for Rebekah. The CoriSafe isn't large enough to hold her feeding tube connection inside, and the fabric solutions don't do anything to hold the connection together. However, in looking for other solutions, I learned a few things:\nCoriSafe was designed to also keep the feeding tube connection clean, especially for kids with diapers.\nThe fabric solutions are made to be comfortable. A feeding-tube leading to the stomach is generally short, and the connection is close to the wearer. That means anything that covers the connection could be irritating if it has scratchy surfaces or sharp edges.\nWith the new things I'd learned in mind, I started thinking of what I could do to make something new for Rebekah.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: Collect Information - What's Out There?"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I sat down with my wife to doodle for a few minutes, and you can see our lovely artwork above (don't mind my handwriting)!

This would make the cover easy to assemble, easy to clean, and easy to use.\nIn making the box I also designed it for 3D printing.

After I figured that out, I printed my first prototype.\nWhen I picked up the parts from my printer, I realized that I'd made a silly mistake. My hinges fit together, but there was nothing to keep them from coming apart! They were also not aligned properly, and when the two box halves were assembled, they had a funny offset.\nI redesigned the hinge, and printed another version. That one turned out much better. The hinge worked, it snapped together nicely, and stayed closed.\nBoth versions took about 3 hours to print with a 0.5mm nozzle and 0.4mm layer height, and they weighed about 3.5 oz when assembled.

We don't want the weight to pull on Rebekah's body.\nCould the hinges be put inside?\nWhat about creating a more secure latching mechanism to keep it closed?\nWhat about adding something like a loop to attach it to a wheelchair with a carabiner?\nWith those ideas in mind, I started working on an improved design.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 5: Gather Feedback - Letting Others Try It Out"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "First, I shrank the box as small as it could go, and I added a loop for a keyring (Check out the small black box in the pictures). That worked out really well until I tried to heat treat it to make it dishwasher safe (more on that process later). As you can see from the pictures, the halves of the box warped severely when they were heat treated, basically becoming unusable.\nWith that I went back to the drawing board. How could I create something that wouldn't warp? Well, I knew that parts generally shrink along the layer lines. That's why my parts shrank upward into a \"U\" shape, and that gave me an idea. What if I used a cylinder as my container instead of a box? That way, when the part shrinks along its layers, it will simply reduce the diameter of the circle slightly.\nYou can see the results in the pictures above. First I printed the larger black parts as a proof-of-concept. Then I printed the smaller white parts. Both of them use simple threads to hold the two halves together, and I had much better results when I heat treated this design.\nFinally, I made a few minor modifications, and the rocket ship parts in the last pictures are what I sent to Rebekah for my aunt and uncle to try out.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6J/M0M3/JSYZ8FP9/F6JM0M3JSYZ8FP9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9E/EYQ5/JSYZ8FPA/F9EEYQ5JSYZ8FPA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPP/3QYU/JSYZ8FPZ/FPP3QYUJSYZ8FPZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWW/UYR8/JSYZ8FQ0/FWWUYR8JSYZ8FQ0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEQ/362E/JSYZ8FQP/FEQ362EJSYZ8FQP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Y/0C4M/JSYZ8FQQ/F1Y0C4MJSYZ8FQQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR8/YDUO/JSYZ8FQR/FR8YDUOJSYZ8FQR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3G/BNA0/JSYZ8GIB/F3GBNA0JSYZ8GIB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1B/DF8N/JSYZ8GHS/F1BDF8NJSYZ8GHS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC7/HYL5/JSYZ8GIV/FC7HYL5JSYZ8GIV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOY/UKFO/JSYZ8GJE/FOYUKFOJSYZ8GJE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2A/IBDG/JSYZ8FQS/F2AIBDGJSYZ8FQS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP0/P1CE/JSYZ8FRT/FP0P1CEJSYZ8FRT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH5/5ONN/JSYZ8FRU/FH55ONNJSYZ8FRU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2E/GD1O/JSYZ8FSJ/F2EGD1OJSYZ8FSJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F09/9LUP/JSYZ8FSK/F099LUPJSYZ8FSK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Improve the Design - Learn From Feedback and Make Improvements"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "And with that, I present to you my final product! If you'd like to make one yourself for someone you love, simply print my file from Thingiverse using PLA! It's important to use PLA because only PLA will respond correctly to the heat treating process below.\nImportant! As others have rightly pointed out (here, and here, and here), 3D printed parts have thousands of tiny crevices that make a perfect harbor for small food particles and germs. Any 3D printed part (like a cookie cutter) that comes into contact with food MUST be sanitized to prevent the growth of bacteria. Because this feeding tube connection cover will likely touch food, I strongly advise that you follow the steps below to make your parts safe for the top rack of the dishwasher:\nPlace something oven-safe like a cast-iron skillet or pizza stone into your oven and cover it with aluminum foil. That will help hold the heat and prevent large temperature fluctuations.\nPreheat your oven to 200*F or 95*C. You may have to experiment with the oven temperature a little to get good results. The right temperature will vary depending on what brand of PLA you use.\nAfter the oven reaches temperature, let it sit for half an hour to get a good, steady temperature inside.\nInsert a piece of 1+1/8\" dowel that is 2\" long into the \"cone\" of the rocket ship. Then screw the two pieces together. The dowel will help to keep the threads from warping as they're heat treated.\nSet the parts in the oven on the cast-iron skillet or pizza stone. (That's why we covered them with foil earlier).\nSet the timer on the oven for an hour, and shut the oven off when the timer runs out. Leave the parts in the oven!\nWith the parts still inside, wait for your oven to cool to room temperature. This allows the parts to cool slowly inside the oven in a process called \"annealing.\"\nCongratulations! With that finished, your feeding tube connection cover is ready to use.\nBe sure to take a good look at the parts after you run them through the dishwasher the first time. Check for deformation or remaining food particles (ick!). It was so important to me to make this cover dishwasher safe, and I'd love to hear suggestions on how to make the design even easier to clean and sanitize.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTR/GIOT/JSYZ8FSM/FTRGIOTJSYZ8FSM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNG/YJNK/JSYZ8FSN/FNGYJNKJSYZ8FSN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1A/EPJS/JSYZ8FSO/F1AEPJSJSYZ8FSO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIR/QLVM/JSYZ8FSP/FIRQLVMJSYZ8FSP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFQ/GQFJ/JSYZ8FSQ/FFQGQFJJSYZ8FSQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOI/L3W9/JSYZ8FTF/FOIL3W9JSYZ8FTF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Share With Others"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "I learned so much through this process!

Warped boards can pinch the blade of a circular saw and cause a kick back of the tool which is not a fun experience.

I cut the pieces to rough length first leaving about 1 inch of extra material. (Be sure to remove any metal from reclaimed or urban lumber)\nOver at the jointer I flatten one face of each board. Maintain downward pressure on the outfeed table once the board has passed the cutterhead. This produces a flat face and reference surface for the next step. Flatten one face of each board in this manner paying attention to grain direction.\nThe planer is the next step in the milling process. Put the jointed face down on the planer bed and feed the board into the planer removing about 1/16\" or less per pass. You can see where there were nails in this board.

This Winter has been particularly frigid, and I seem to have acquired more plants than I had room for. Time for some plant hangers!\nEven the most basic plant hangers at my local nursery cost $20, and I wasn't happy with the limited color selection. After wearing out a burnt orange t-shirt, I used it to make yarn for my first planter hanger; it worked and looked great in my home (and was soon joined by many other hanging planters). My t-shirt plant hangers don't use any materials other than your old shirt, making the cost $0. The color is determined by whatever shirt you use, so the options are endless! I don't use any fancy knots--just your basic overhand knot.

Use the rotary cutter, ruler, and cutting mat to cut the shirt just below the sleeves. If your shirt has a printed design, cut below the design. Cut the hem off of the bottom of the shirt, leaving you with a round tube of fabric. I use the rest of the shirt for making T-Shirt Journals if it has a cool design, and I cut up all un-printed parts of the shirt to use for shop rags.\nFold the tube so that the bottom fold sticks out about 2\" above the top fold. Using your ruler as a guide for width, cut through all the layers of fabric in thick strips, stopping the cut just after the top fold. Repeat the cutting across the entire tube until you have a jelly-fish-like shape of many fabric tentacles attached at the top.\nUnfold and shake it out. Your tube will now resemble a ribcage with large loops of fabric connected at the top. Lay the connected section flat. Cut across the section at a diagonal (see diagram), connecting each cut line on the right side with the cut line just above it on the left side. Continue cutting up the section in parallel diagonal lines. The first and last cuts will be from a previously cut line to the edge of the fabric; keeps these cuts parallel.\nAfter all of your cuts are made, you will have one long piece of t-shirt. Starting at an end, grab about an 18\" section of the piece and pull it tight. As if by magic, this will curl up the fabric into a nice round piece of t-shirt yarn! Keep moving down the strip of fabric, pulling it tight as you go until you have a lovely pile of t-shirt yarn.

Tie these strands together with another overhand knot, using the same distance you used before. Repeat around the first layer of knots, connecting the strands into a neat little net.

If you're finding that weights aren't enough to prevent curling, flip the board over when it's dried, colour side facing down, and either wipe the back with a fairly damp cloth or use a spray bottle and wet the back.

Feel free to swap out or improve what you dislike. Remember I made mine mostly from parts I got gifted, or could get for cheap. Lots of room for improvement!\nUnbranded deco fireplace\nIKEA BISSA black shoe cabinet\nThrifted Eizo FlexScan S1721 17 inch monitor\nBlack acrylic paint (monitor, touch ups)\nFour pre-drilled aluminum L-hooks\nRaspberry Pi, with optional black casing\nMicroSD 10 speed card\nDVI to HDMI cable\nMini-jack to mini-jack cable\nBlack outlet strip with on/off button\nBrass kitchen cabinet handle\nThe deco fireplace\nMy hack started out with this electric fireplace. I got it gifted from a friend, and after seeing some fireplaces and stoves in reallife, I wanted to fit it in a nice housing. My fireplace measures approximately 40cm in width and 25 in depth. It is a metal box with a vacuformed hard plastic top, which you can see in the picture. Inside the box is a halogen lamp under a sort of metal hamster wheel. It's all powered by regular 220V euro cable that goes in any socket in the house. I describe this, so that if you get creative, you could try to make this yourself. But if you don't bother, try to find one at a thriftshop, or wait for a christmas sale. I saw other ones at thrift shops which only needed a dab of paint, or a new lamp.\nTip: try to see if you can replace the (halogen) lamp with a LED lamp. It will give less warmth, but will decrease your electricity bill!\n\nThe IKEA BISSA shoe rack\nSo, once you own a digital fireplace with said dimensions, it easily fits in this shoe cabinet. You can of course go for a different one, that fits your home better. I have looked at vintage night stands, thrifted kitchen cabinets, old stoves, and so. Stay creative and find someting that fits your style. Just make sure there is place for the monitor (if you wish for one) and for the electronics - the latter should be out of sight. For example, a drawer in a night stand does the trick perfectly.\nAs you might notice, I did not assemble this shoe rack the way it is supposed to. Read the next step of this Instructable to see how to get it just this way.\nEIZO FlexScan S1721 17 inch monitor\nAgain, I thrifted this one from a student nearby. It only cost me 2 euros and that's cheap. EIZO is known for its true-colour monitors, and as a designer, I love that. You can of course go for a different brand of flatscreen. Just check that it is approximately as wide as your fireplace, and that it has a Vesa mount on the back. The latter makes it easy to screw it to the back plate. It saves you a lot of work on other solutions, like glueing it forever, or making a small ridge to have it stand on. If you're smart, you'll look for a black monitor, not a white one. Saves you the paint!\nRegarding the connecting cable: buy the appropriate cable that fits both your monitor output, and the Pi. Check the angle of the connector. The connector on the monitor should be either facing down, up, or sideways, to provide a flush placement of the cable. The end of the cable should likewise fit the monitor; in a way that the cable preferably hangs from the bottom of the monitor, while the monitor is screwed flat to the back plate of your cabinet. I don't recommend wrapping your cable in impossible angles.\nTip: keep in mind that, with the monitor screwed to the back plate, you'll have no wiggle room for the cable. Attach it firmly before mounting the monitor!\n\nThe rest of the materials\n...speak for themselves, I suppose. Get them at your local electronics shop or in case of the handle, home depot.

You'll need it elsewhere.\nDon't assemble both drawers.\nDon't assemble the top drawer hinges.\nConstruct the lower drawer, and attach a handle to its top. It makes it easy to open the drawer.\nOn top of the drawer, attach the two slats you should've used as back support. Fix them halfway the cabinet, horizontally in a row, so the electronic fireplace can easily rest on top of them. If your fireplace has an on/off switch on the bottom like mine, be sure it isn't in the way.\nUse the panel from the top drawer to construct a back plate. You'll notice that it fits, but leaves a tiny gap. That's intended, since it used to be a drawer panel that should slide flush between the two sidepanels. Fix the drawer panel to the top of the back with the four L-hooks. This is sturdy enough to carry the monitor.\nDrill the four holes for the monitor mount. I have aligned the monitor flush with the top of my cabinet, because so, it fits just above my electric fireplace. Also, in later assembling and disassembling, it is easy to hold it in the right place while you fasten the screws. Measure wisely!\nYou can download a Vesa 10 template, or take a piece of paper and punch through the four holes with a sharp tool. You can also smear something greasy and colourful (lipstick, shoe polish?) on the four holes of your monitor and lay it flat on the back plate. The stains tell you where the holes should come. You can, if you own a decent copier, photocopy the back of your monitor, and you'll have a paper template.\nWe're about to assemble the monitor.

I needed to use a separate minijack cable between the Pi and the monitor. Check if you do, too.\nNext, the lazy part: drop all the electronics in the lower bin of the cabinet.\nI use a black outlet strip inside the cabinet, so only one cable comes out at the back. The RaspBerry Pi and the monitor are plugged in at the strip.

The candle I want to make will have a sealed top and only the wick will protrude through the top of the candle so I wanted to make sure to find the best possible combination of wick and oil.\nWicks:\nSo 100% cotton is the easiest wick to make or find. I used a cotton cloth and cut it into strips. Then tested burning it with different types of oils and at different lengths. It worked really well but does get consumed each time the oil runs low, just like a regular candle but as long as it's feed with oil it keeps burning. I also tried salting the cotton wicks to prevent charring and consumption of the wick but I found it made very little or no difference.\nAdvantages: Easy to find, inexpensive.\nDisadvantages: Is consumed over time.\nA fiberglass wick is harder to find but works better and doesn't get consumed when the fuel/oil runs low, the flame just goes out. For this Instructables I'll show you how to make one of these wicks from fiberglass cloth. Or you can buy fiberglass rope used to seal the doors of wood-stoves. The only disadvantage of fiberglass is when working with it, you should wear a mask when cutting it, as cutting will release small glass fibers into the air and it's best that you don't get it in your lungs. It's safe to work with fiberglass just be smart about it.\nAdvantages: Is not consumed.\nDisadvantages: Trickier to work with, respiratory irritant.\nTypes of Oil:\nI tested few types of oil, corn, vegetable, olive, canola and coconut. All the oils worked, however I found all some of them produced some soot or smoke, especially if the wick was too long. Also some oils are too viscous and didn't wick very fast.\nI found the one that work the best was coconut oil, I tested both solid and liquid. The solid coconut oil melts at 26c and when the candle was lit it help keep the rest of the oil liquid just from the heat of the flame. The liquid coconut oil worked equally well. The viscosity of coconut oil is light compared to the other oils tested and produced almost no soot. It wicked well and burned the best of all the oils.\nWinner: Liquid coconut oil (expensive comparatively) but really any oil will work.\nConclusion:\nOverall regardless of the wick and depending on the type of oil used the capillary action could only supply enough oil to the burning end of the wick up to a certain point. I found after a distance of 1.5\" of the flame to the top of the oil, the rate of oil being \"wicked\" could not feed enough oil to keep the flame lit.\nFor this build I will use a DIY fiberglass wick and liquid coconut oil. But if you don't like the idea of using fiberglass cloth or don't have access to it cotton works just fine too. I just like the idea of not having to replace the wick.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOM/2YNN/JSAORQCE/FOM2YNNJSAORQCE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSO/GT23/JSAORK0M/FSOGT23JSAORK0M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4Y/NYD4/JSAORJZ5/F4YNYD4JSAORJZ5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYA/6H51/JSAORJZ8/FYA6H51JSAORJZ8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Testing Different Wicks and Oils"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "So lets make the candle now that we have the testing done. I'll show a few different candles that I made but all the techniques apply.\nCandle One:\nThe first candle I made is from a modern looking square tile that would look cool as a stand alone object.\nDrilling the Hole in the Tile:\nI drilled a hole directly in the middle of the tile, sized slightly larger than the diameter of the bottom of the eyelet. This will depend on what ever size you choose for an eyelet.\nDrilling into a tile requires using a proper drill bit, I purchased a bunch of diamond drill bits on ebay or amazon but if you don't want to wait you can find them at the hardware store, you'll just pay more. Also a carbide bit will work too but they don't seem to last as long. When drilling into the tile be sure to use ample water to help lubricate the cutting action, it also helps remove the cut material and prevents it from becoming airborne.\nA tip for when drilling into the tile when using diamond drill bits, they are more like mini hole saws with no pilot bit. So it's best to start at an angle to cut a small groove to get the bit started so it won't wander, then bring the drill upright to drill through the tile (don't forget the water). Clean up the tile and then insert the eyelet into the hole.\nLet the tile dry before continuing onto the next step.\nAttaching the Oil Reservoir:\nFor the oil reservoir I used a small \"mise en place\" bowl. I positioned and then marked the outside rim of the bowl on the bottom of the tile so I would have a reference once I was ready to glue the bowl on. Next I mixed up some 5 minute epoxy and applied it to the tile where I marked the bowl line.\nThis next step is optional but I partially filled up the bowl with small ornamental rocks, this serves two purposes, one it displaces the amount of oil needed to fill the reservoir and two also looks nice. If you fill the bowl with rocks the tile will need to be placed on the bowl to glue them together. Otherwise the bowl can be placed onto the tile (easier this way). Let the assembled candle sit until the epoxy sets.\nFill with Oil\nNext fill the candle with oil using a tiny funnel, as mentioned in the previous step, I like using liquid coconut oil as it burner cleanly and is less viscous than other oils. Remember don't over fill the candle.\nMake and Insert Wick\nIn the previous step I explained how to make a wick but I will quickly go over how to make one. Take some fiberglass cloth cut to about 3\" x 3\" and roll or fold into a tube. Use a glue gun and dab a bit of glue at the bottom of the wick to hold it together. If necessary add a dab in the middle as well.\nIf you don't like or have access to fiberglass cloth, make a wick using 100% cotton by cutting strips of it.\nTake the wick and insert into the eyelet hole, until the wick is just protruding above the hole. Trim with scissors if there are stray fibers. Depending on how the candle burner you will need to adjust the height of the wick as needed.\nLight the Candle\nGive the wick a few minute to saturate with oil. Then light it! Adjust the wick as needed, the fibreglass type wick will last indefinitely where as cotton ones will need to be trimmed and pulled up every so often and eventually replaced. The candle should burn for hours, it will stop once it can't wick anymore fuel you will need to refill it by adding more oil with the tiny funnel.

The kitchen used to be a porch at some point and is slanted due to the pitch of the porch for the rain run off. That means that nothing is square, level, or possible to outfit with anything off the shelf because the shelf don't fit.\nFor 7 years, we had an old book shelf shimmed up with blocks of wood to make a make shift pantry in what at one point was a laundry area. I always wanted to improve it so this past winter, I took the time to do such. The goal was not only to create more shelving space, but also shelves that my wife can reach. I don't want to say she is short, but vertically challenged seems like not the right words either. 4' 8\" means things are hard to reach so sliding drawer to reach the back was important.\nAnd anything I don't want her to have (my reese's cups) can go at the back of the top shelf and they are mine all mine hahaha.....

I spray painted the inside white, caulked the edges, and added some foam insulation behind it because it was just a constant draft. Someday when someone tears out the pantry to expose the window again, they will at least be treated with a nice smile for their efforts.\n\nBefore I could start framing in the new pantry, I needed to remove all existing molding, fix a bunch of holes in the drywall, tear out the ceiling above to find what I could frame to, and remove a dozen or more hooks and nails that were put in over time.\nThe ceiling was old plaster and lath, so that was fun, but I got it removed and added some framing to make it easier to attach to. With it, old insulation, mouse nests, a rat skull, and some old tar paper scraps/ nails from when they fixed the roof sometime ago.

I drew out exactly what I wanted, spacing for the shelves, widths, depth, etc. I had to shim the back up nearly 3 inches from the front corner. We have a horribly un-square floor. Then the wall next to it showed how far out of square it was. I ended up framing it into 3 sections so I could stagger the new molding at the top, and taper it at the base to hide the un-square space. Plywood was added top, bottom and sides, just not the back wall. Only a few small sections were attached there to keep things square. Mostly I used 3/4 plywood. On the right wall, 1/2 ply to give me a solid place to attach hooks for stuff several steps from now.\nAfter finishing the framing, I had to fix the holes and gaps in the drywall. I first hit all gaps with spray foam to fill voids. I then drywall mudded the gaps to fill in the surface and finish to what looked like all drywall. I used a combination of durabond to build up fast and finish mud to make it so the surface could be sanded out. A trick I used is after the mud is dried and sanded smooth, you water down some finishing mud to a thick paint consistency and use a roller to apply another coat. This dries similar to the existing paint build up all around. When you then prime and paint twice you can't see the difference of new paint vs areas that have 15 coats over the years.\nOnce the drywall was completed, the front was capped with 1/2 inch thick maple strips to hide the plywood framing. A pin nailer and glue was used to keep the surface as clean as possible. Everything was primed and coated in 3 coats of semi gloss white to match my existing wood work.\nYou will notice I did not frame in the vertical pull out can rack yet.\nThis is because there is not enough room to attach the slides once it is installed. So to fix that I had to pre install them before I put in the dividing panel. That meant paint, finish, attach glides, and then install.

The fronts were tapered down so you could see what was in the drawer.\nThe basic box was made for each drawer with 1/2 plywood. A small grove was cut in the front, back and bottom to accommodate a dividing slat for strength. The sides were also gloved to support the front plate and add some joint strength. These were pin nailed and glued together. Screws were put into the center dividing plate from the bottom. Once assembled, a face plate of 3/4 ply was attached to each drawer. These had chamferred edges for some added style.

With a few stainless steel screws, a used exercise bike, and some threaded rod we were ready to rock and roll.\nGrind on!", "title": "Apple Press and Apple Grinder - on the Cheap", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Apple-Press-and-Apple-Grinder-on-the-Cheap/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "A neighbor down the road was having the floor to her old barn disassembled and offered up the old oak timbers for free if I wanted them. There was some nail pulling, some nail breaking, some cursing, and then finally some resolution as I was able to extract nice 8' long 4\"x6\" posts and some beautiful 12' long 2-1/2\"x8-1/2\" planks. These both sat in our barn for quite a while until this fateful day...\nWe had come to the previously mentioned conclusion (you know, \"apples turned into alcohol sounds like a good idea\") and I had a Eureka moment and said \"I think I have the materials to do part of the job\". We needed something that was rigid, stout, and able to withstand 12 tons of force, and the oak I had reclaimed fit the bill perfectly.\nI cut the uprights / posts at 40\" long, cut the bottom 2-1/2\"x4\" cross bracing at 28\" and the upper 4\"x6\" support at 34\" long. The uprights were dadoed about 5\" down. The dado was 1\" deep and the exact width of the upper support.\nHoles were marked for the 3/4\" threaded rod and then drilled one layer at a time with a 3/4\" auger bit and heavy duty hammer drill. The threaded rod passes through the four joints of the press and is secured using large square washers and square nuts. We found all of the hardware in the basement of an old house, so at this point we are still working with completely free materials.\nYou will need to have the press on a sturdy, moveable surface. We used an old wooden workbench someone was tossing out along with a couple of the oak planks I scored from the barn reconstruction. No need to screw or clamp anything down, the mass of the oak press is enough to keep everything in place while you are working.\nFinally, we installed a thick scrap of steel directly where the piston of the bottle jack would contact the upper support brace. This takes the majority of the impact and prevents too much damage directly to the wood with 24,000 pounds of force applied to it.\nLet's move on to the grinding box and I will show you how all of it works at the very end of the instructable with a couple of videos and some more pics.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQP/WLA5/JRQOROM7/FQPWLA5JRQOROM7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7N/TCNL/JRQOROL5/F7NTCNLJRQOROL5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F40/5LT0/JRQOROK2/F405LT0JRQOROK2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: A Bit De-pressing - Build the Apple Press"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "In order to make cider you are going to need to grind up the apples pretty good. A decent grinder or \"scratter\" can set you back nearly $200, but with some simple materials and about $30 you can build one yourself. The grinding box was made out of a dense hardwood, in this case red birch and white oak. Basically it is a box that is screwed together with a bottom slanting plate that helps work the apples to the grinding drum. We made the grinding drum out of a chunk of oak that I turned on the lathe to a 5\" diameter and cut to a width that would fit in the box with only 1/8\" of space on either side to accommodate wood swelling. You will need to have a hole drilled through the entire grinder head, or alternatively you can glue up two pieces of wood after you have dadoed out a groove in the both sides of the wood that will accommodate the shaft. You can then take the dadoed and glued wood and turn it down to size. No lathe? No problem, you can get away with using a really nice round, dry log made of hard maple or a similar wood. Make sure the bark is removed and you have sanded it down neatly. Use what you have around the house or find in the woods, that's half the fun!\nMy, what big teeth you have: You will need to put some teeth in the drum before you insert the whole thing into the box. You will have to draw spirals on the drum about 3/4\" apart with parallel lines about 1\" apart. The intersections of those lines is where you will put you stainless steel screws inserted at about 30 degrees (see the picture for help). The heads of the screws will act as the grinding component for the scratter. How you orient the screws, how deep you screw them into the wood, how many you put in the wood, and the angle you put them will determine how well they grind the apples. We had 70 screws in the drum set at 30 degrees. At first the drum didn't turn smoothly so we slowly adjusted the depth of the screws until they just barley nicked the box as they spun.\nShaft... shut your mouth: The cider gods were smiling down upon us and we happened to have a long 3/4\" stainless steel rod that once belonged in some science lab. A parent of one of my students gave it to me and literally said \"do you think you could use this for something?\" At the time some wicked ideas came into my mind... but I am happy that I stuck with the narrow path, and lo and behold, an apple scratter shaft was born! Ready for the bonus? The shaft was threaded on one end with the nut in tack and the whole get up fit beautifully on an old crankset from a road bike, nut, threads and all. I ended up drilling a hole in the shaft with a cobalt bit that allowed a bolt to slid through, passing through the grinding shaft and holding it in place tightly in the box. The shaft passes through holes drilled in the box and the hardwood is dense enough to act as a decent bushing with a bit of mineral oil added occasionally to keep things spinning nicely. I also used some nifty clamps I made from hardwood to hold onto the shaft and keep it place, see the pics for some explanations. As for the threads on the grinder shaft connecting to the bike crank, make sure that the threads face the right direction so that as you grind the apples you are not loosing the entire crank. Also, you want to make sure your screws are facing the right way so that they properly bite into your apples. We then clamped the box right to the table with the apple press and prepared for amazingness!\nWhat a grind: So we used my grinding handle to start with the grinding and after an hour of jerky, exhausting, arm-wrenching we decided that something had to be done to make things work better than the current rig.

My wife's old iron horse was gathering dust in the shed and was resurrected to come out and play the role of apple munching machine. I build a really quick bike stand for the bike using some old planks, 6x6's and a couple of cut offs of pipe to hold the quick release skewer in place... at least somewhat. I then took the old' haws (horse) and placed er' in the hitch'n rail. I took some old chains and linked them together, placed one end of the loop over the rear gear cluster on the bike, and then the other loop over the remaining chainring on the cranking arm. Then I pulled everything tight and put a couple of stakes behind the bike stand to hold it in place... jumped on board and pedaled! Take a look at the video. It worked pretty good overall but there were a number of times that things didn't line up right and the chain would jump off and bring everything to a halt... also scare the crud out you. Also, the length of the chain really made it so we could not put too many apples in the box without things getting jammed up. This worked, and still would be fine today... in fact we used it for two years producing around 200 gallons of cider, but we needed something a bit more robust to keep the good liquid flowing.

You will have to figure this out on your own, but basically you want to make sure that the thing sits firmly on the base through the use of troughs, holes, screws, posts, etc...\nBuild the uprights to hold your grinding box and use angled braces to keep the thing in place when you start doing your grinding.\nAdd your gear, chainring, or what have you to your exercise machine and make sure that the chain will match up with the gear on your grinding box and your bike.\nPut on your chain and use shims behind the box to bring it to the tightness you are looking for.\nHop on and let er' rip!\nWe also added a new sheet of steel flashing to make the apple transition from whole to pulverized better... for us at least, definitely not better for the apple.\nHere's how the whole process works with grinding and pressing...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FA5/TY6W/JRQOROT4/FA5TY6WJRQOROT4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAW/NF5W/JRQOROT9/FAWNF5WJRQOROT9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2Z/56H2/JRQOROT2/F2Z56H2JRQOROT2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPK/DR95/JRQOROT6/FPKDR95JRQOROT6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXU/ZH64/JRQOROUW/FXUZH64JRQOROUW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F82/4DG2/JRQOROTT/F824DG2JRQOROTT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSY/0YA8/JRV8AS26/FSY0YA8JRV8AS26.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJN/OWVS/JRV8AS27/FJNOWVSJRV8AS27.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOQ/U2KK/JRV8AS2M/FOQU2KKJRV8AS2M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGB/1LKK/JRV8AS2V/FGB1LKKJRV8AS2V.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Eat Your Heart Out Jane Fonda! - the Exercider 2000"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "If you look back a couple of steps you both saw and heard the steps explained in one of the videos. But to summarize, you need to have some type of press rack and cheese cloth to put the apple mash into. You will use a square box with no top or bottom to fill up the cheese cloth with apple pulp, then fold the cheese cloth and put a rack on top of it. Then layer with another cheese cloth filled with apple pulp, and a third if you can after putting a rack between them. Finally you will put your pressing block, basically a big chunk of wood that can distribute the force of the jack to the cheeses and racks. You will also need additional blocks to slide under the bottle jack as you press down the cheeses and the apples compress. Under all of this you need a large flat tray with a hole at the end to collect the goods. I think the videos gives the low down nicely.\nGet to it! - Once you have pressed the cider you are going to want to either drink it, freeze it, or ferment it. If you are fermenting it you are probably going to want to use some campden tablets or potassium metabisulphite to sterilize the current yeasts and bacteria in the cider so that you can pitch your own yeast into it. You are also going to want to use a decent wine or ale yeast and some yeast nutrient with your hard cider since apples have a tendency to cause yeasts to putter out and produce nasty sulphuric compounds that can ruin your cider. Whatever you choose to do, make sure you don't leave the cider out for too long. Overnight is totally fine (although it will start fermenting overnight) but definitely get to it the next day or you will get some funk going on.\nAnd that's about it... always a work in progress and always adding new and nifty ways to solve a problem or make things even better.

Underneath I found badly rusted tang. I decided to dump the blade in vinegar overnight so the rust comes off easily. I am going to sand the knife anyways but I thing it's often best to remove rust first so I know I'm not sanding off any stamps an If I have extremely bad pitting which requires me to start with very rough sand paper. After vinegar I used a wire brush to cleaned the blade. I also noticed the very edge of the blade was dark after vinegar which means the blade probably has very hard steel inside maybe a stainless steel jacket.\n\nI decided to also use a belt sander to remove rust from the tang as it was badly rusted. After this I took out most of the pitting from the blade with the belt sander. this was followed with sanding down the chipped parts of the edge on the disk sander. Because I sanded the edge down I now had to regrind the bevels so I moved back to the belt sander to do most of the work. I finished the edged by filing as I personally find that more accurate way to do it.\nAfter the blade was already usable but not very sharp or shiny I moved to polishing as polishing is also usually a good way to get extremely sharp knife. I started by sanding the sides of the blade with 120 and 240 grit papers on a block to keep the sides as flat as possible. I did some hand sanding around the makers mark to keep it intact. Then hand sanded the whole blade with grits 400, 800, 1200 and 2000. When sanding, every time you move to finer grit you might want to change the direction you sand slightly so you can see when you have removed all the scratches from the previous grits.\nAfter getting the blade to 2000 grits it was already quite shiny but using metal polish compound on wool buffing wheel takes it to next level. I have found that during winter when I use these wax based compounds I need a little higher RPM to get a good polish than I need during summer. I think it helps the wax to melt the wax giving better polish.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FW8/BI9O/JRV88JUE/FW8BI9OJRV88JUE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJQ/UUZI/JRV88JUP/FJQUUZIJRV88JUP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDG/1LKX/JRV88JV0/FDG1LKXJRV88JV0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6C/CHX4/JRV88JVC/F6CCHX4JRV88JVC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSE/4SKX/JRV88JW1/FSE4SKXJRV88JW1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNN/2BA1/JRV88JVN/FNN2BA1JRV88JVN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTJ/NQND/JRV88JVQ/FTJNQNDJRV88JVQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHF/219U/JRV88JX0/FHF219UJRV88JX0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI3/B9PR/JRV88JXZ/FI3B9PRJRV88JXZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKW/OT40/JRV88JY0/FKWOT40JRV88JY0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFI/BON9/JRV88JY1/FFIBON9JRV88JY1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH8/9A9G/JRV88JY2/FH89A9GJRV88JY2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Restoring the Blade"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "For the handle I cut a piece of ash with some nice splits to fill with resin but my fist try failed because I used wrong type of resin. You can see that on the video. I bought clear casting resin for my second try. I put the piece of wood in a vise and hammered on it until it broke in two parts. This gave me cool broken wood texture which would be visible inside the resin on the handle. the I used a dremel to flatten an area in the middle of the black to make drilling easier. The I drilled a hole for the tang of my knife. I made two holes next to each others to make the hole wide enough for the tang. Then I used epoxy glue to attach the tang to the wood. The resin will later lock the blade in the handle so that it wont come off.\nI had made a mold in which I would pour the resin. My mold had 3 layers and worked fine as I was going to sand the handle to final shape anyways. I made a box from cardboard which barely fitted around my wooden handle blank. Cardboard was used to give rigidness for my mold as the 2 outer parts of the mold were not as sturdy. The cardboard was tall enough to fit all the resin in. I covered the carboard firs tightly with aluminum foil and then with tape to prevent any leakages.\nI used a bit of food coloring to make it slightly blue to imitate ice better (although ice actually is colorless but we think it's bluish so that makes better fake ice). Depending on the resin you use you might need different type of approach. I mixed the color before adding hardener to give me more time before the resin starts to gel down. Then I slowly poured the resin in the mold trying to avoid bubbles. I tapped the mold lightly to the side to get most of the formed bubbles out. The I just left the resin to dry.\nAfter the resin was dried I sanded the handle to my wanted oval shape. At this point the surface was of course very rough and the resin was not transparent. Also a couple bubbles that were still left to the resin had surfaced. I filled the bubbles with resin and coated the whole handle with a layer of the resin to make it nice and shiny. This also causes the sanded resin to become transparent again.

Secondly, the fact that the guitar is no longer at the botanical gardens suggests that the bottom rotted out because it was propped directly into the soil. With all the waterproofing we did inside and out, and the addition of an actual guitar stand, I know this one will stand the test of time!\nNext time you run into a guitar that's past its prime as a musical instrument, I hope you'll give our Instructables a try!

The sealant is thick and sticky, so the nail brush does wonders to scrub away the residue.\nWhen the brushes are clean, we wrap them with a piece of paper towel to keep the bristles together and let it them dry until we\u2019re ready for the next coat.\nLiquid Rubber cures within 24 \u2013 48 hours. After the last coat, we let it dry a few days before painting the outer surface of the guitar.

The first lampshade I made using a black posterboard, as directed by the tutorial I found, but there were some things I didn't like about it. So, in honor of \"The Cardboard Challenge,\" I decided to \"up\" the level of \"upcycle\" and make the next lampshades out of old cardboard boxes! We go through a lot of pizza and pizza related foods, so I used those boxes, but cereal boxes will work as well (better, because they're bigger).\nI hope you enjoy this fun, personalized spin on this lampshade design!", "title": "Personalized \"Geeky\" Lampshade From Cardboard", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Personalized-Geeky-Lampshade-From-Cardboard/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Materials: Necessary\nLampshade\nPush pin, bobby pin, or needle\nFoam sheet or thicker cardboard\nI used a piece of closed cell foam from a yoga/camping mat\nScissors and/or X-Acto knife\nRuler\nThin cardboard\nCereal boxes, other food boxes (yes, we have a thing for pizza here!)\nPlain printer paper\nPen/Pencil\nHot glue gun and glue sticks OR strong tape\nScotch Tape\nMaterials: Optional\nComputer and printer\nPaint and brush\nColored paper\nTin foil\nModPodge (regular glue works just as well)\nRibbon\nOther \u201cdecorative materials\u201d of your choice\nIf you don't have a lampshade at your house already, most thrift/resale stores have them CHEAP!

I could clearly see where I had creased the plastic. The sections aren't perfectly even, but they're close enough for this project!\nThen, you need to measure how much space you have one each section, to know how large your design should be to fill the space. Measure and mark one inch from the top, bottom and each side. This inch margin will not be part of the pattern, it will be covered with \"decoration\" later. Measure the space in between the margins, both length and width. I ended up with about 6\"x6\" to work with. Record your measurements somewhere, we'll come back to them in Step 7.

As the lamp sections will overlap slightly when we put them all back together, if you don't do this, you'll end up with a gap where the new lampshade doesn't fit all the way around the rings. The gap is easily fixable, but if you want to avoid it, add some excess cardboard to the edges while you're tracing your lampshade section to cardboard.***\nCut out each traced section from the cardboard.

I already mentioned the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system, these to are part of the autonomic nervous system.\nThe autonomic nervous system is the part of the nervous system where involuntary bodily functions are being regulated such as blood pressure, digestion and breathing.\nThe sympathetic nervous system is all about alertness and action, it is responsible for the 'fight or flight response'.\nThe parasympathetic nervous system is all about peace, it is responsible for the 'rest and digest' response. Sometimes people get stuck in 'fight or fight mode', they can't switch back from the sympathetic to the parasympathetic nervous system, as a result they feel stressed and/or anxious practically all the time.\nAlthough the reason for the sympathetic nervous system to get stuck can vary from person to person, in the end it always seems to come down to overstimulation.\nApplying pressure to the body is a way to calm down the sympathetic nervous system and give the parasympathetic nervous system a chance to finally emerge from the deep and do it's business!\nThe parasympathetic nervous system makes the muscles relax, the hart rate slow down, improves blood circulation and helps with digestion.\nThe body produces endorphins, dopamine and serotonin, which calm the senses and make a person feel at peace.\nAs I stated before, everyone can benefit from deep pressure therapy, but deep pressure is especially important for people who's nervous system is easily overstimulated.\nNeurologically, some deviate from the norm and for those people it can sometimes be hard to function within a society that has evolved around people that perceive and process information in a different way from them.\nWith this Instructable I'm hoping to contribute to spreading awareness on this issue.\nMy inspiration for this project came (in part) from Temple Grandin, who invented the \"squeeze machine\", her inventiveness and research on the topic of deep pressure ( https://www.grandin.com/inc/squeeze.html ) have paved the way for deep pressure to be accepted as a legitimate form of therapy and for the development of other pressure providing devices.\nDeep pressure is a safe form of therapy if performed in the right manner, but since it's better to be safe then sorry I'd like to share some notes of caution with you:\n* Before you start applying pressure to your body make sure that you are well informed about this form of therapy and/or talk to your physician.\n* The body adapts to a certain amount of pressure so don't apply pressure to your body for to long at a time.\n* I designed this harness with adults in mind. Even though deep pressure therapy is commonly used for kids who have been diagnosed with ASD or ADHD I'm not sure if this harness would be suitable for children. Always consult a physician before you start using any kind of pressure device on children and even if your physician approves, don't leave the child unattended wearing this.\n* Never wear this harness during sleep, it's for wearing when you're active only.\n* Do not wear the harness to tight, make sure that you are comfortable and can still breath in and out all the way down to your abdomen effortlessly.\n* Don't use cardboard boxes for this project that have been treated with pesticides or anti-fungals (like thiabendazole), this is often the case with banana boxes. If you can, use cardboard that has been left unpainted, for this project I used what I had lying around (which has paint on it) but plain cardboard is always better.\n* Wear the harness over your shirt, not directly on the skin.", "title": "Cardboard Pressure Harness", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Cardboard-Pressure-Harness/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Materials:\n- Cardboard boxes (which have not been treated with pesticides and/or antifungals)\n- Self adhesive velcro of good quality (hook and loop)\n- Elastic band ( width: 3 cm/ 1,25 inch)\n- Sewing thread\n*Optional; Packaging tape\nTools:\n- Hobby knife\n- Scissors\n- Sewing needle\n- Metal ruler\n- Pencil and eraser\n- Clothespins\n- Pins\n* Optional: Cutting mat, measuring tape", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZH/E4W3/JROTUIX3/FZHE4W3JROTUIX3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Materials & Tools"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Open up your cardboard box and lay the cardboard out flat.\nTry if the cardboard is long enough to fit around your body, on the front the cardboard has to overlap, this is where the velcro closing mechanism will be.\nMake sure that the inner ribs of the cardboard will be in a vertical position, if they would be horizontal the cardboard would fold around you instead of adjusting to the shape of your body.\nIf you're sure that the cardboard is the right size, lay it out flat again.\nYou are going to cut five straps of cardboard for the body of the harness (to whom I will refer to as 'ribs' from now on).\nThe ribs should measure 5 cm/ 2,05 inch in height, the length will depend on your size (don't forget that the cardboard should overlap on the front of your body).\nUse a pencil to mark the outer lines of the ribs so you know where to cut, then lay your metal ruler on the cutting line and cut alongside it with your hobby knife.\nIf the knife doesn't cut through the cardboard entirely at once, repeat the process.\nWhen you've cut al five ribs, see if the fit well and round of the corners with the help of scissors.\nLay the ribs out flat again and decide were the middle of the ribs is, mark it with your pencil.\nNow you are going to make to small horizontal incisions for the elastic to pass through (see the picture above).

With a $5 pack of disposable razors, that's not such a big deal since you just throw them away when they stop giving you a clean cut. But what about when your $150 electric razor stops giving you a clean cut, and you find that new (decent quality) blades are $50??? Dull razors are DANGEROUS, as they're more likely to accidentally cut you while you're shaving. But paying $50 for razor blades every month/few months is dangerous too, for our bank accounts... So we try to figure out how to sharpen our dull razor blades instead of purchasing new ones!\nThere are lots of YouTube videos showing how to \u201csharpen\u201d electric razor blades using Jeweler\u2019s Rouge, or Polishing Paste, and a lot of them involve blood\u2026 As the blades spin into the poor person trying to sharpen the blades like tiny ninja stars... NOT a safe way to sharpen the razor blades! Additionally, who keeps Jeweler\u2019s Rouge or Polishing Paste laying around??? (If you do, please disregard that statement, I take it back!!) My hubby is a private engineering contractor/troubleshooter and we decided to break it down and take a look at it, to \"accurately define the problem\"... Here's what we found.\nThere\u2019s good news for us cheapskates! Razor blades don\u2019t actually get dull. The microscopic edges of the blades oxidize over time, which interferes with the blade\u2019s cutting abilities. When \"sharpening\" the rotary blades, you just need to knock off the oxidation, on both the blades and the screens of the electric razor. Toothpaste contains a little grit to help clean teeth. When we apply toothpaste to the razor instead of our teeth, that grit hones the razor\u2019s blades and removes the microscopic \u201cmetal lips\u201d that form at the edges of the holes in the screens from the blades rubbing over them. This method is simple, quick, involves all \u201con hand materials,\u201d and leaves your Electric Rotary Razor Blades BETTER than brand new!\n*Please Note: This tutorial is for the Cordless \u201cWet/Dry\u201d type of electric razor.*", "title": "Sharpening Rotary Razor Blades - Safe and Simple Method", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Sharpening-Rotary-Razor-Blades-Safe-and-Simple-Met/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "For this project, you will need:\nAn Electric Razor (preferably one you want to start cutting better!)\nToothpaste (any brand/type)\nSmall brush (the same on you normally use to clean your razor, or an old toothbrush)\nHot water (from your sink faucet)\n5 minutes (okay, MAYBE 10 minutes, if you're being responsible and cautious)\nThat's all!\nThe electric razor used in this tutorial is an 8 year old Phillips Electric Razor, but the concept will work on any Cordless Wet/Dry Electric Razor.

But, each blade eventually ends up with a tiny \"wire spring\" (see picture above; it\u2019s the edge of an unhoned blade viewed under 400x magnification) of metal covering the sharp edge of the blade, preventing it from cutting as well. This method both \u201csharpens\u201d AND \u201chones\u201d the blades by removing those wire springs!\nUsing toothpaste instead of Jeweler's Rouge or polishing compounds allows each blade in each \"stack\" to be honed to cut again, instead of just targeting the first blade\nJeweler's Rogue/polishing compounds don't clean the space between the two blades; instead, they almost \"cement\" the blades together.\nOn our razor with 9 blade stacks on each of the three razor heads, \"cementing\" the blade stacks together means we'd have 27 cutting blades, instead of the *54* we SHOULD have.\nUsing toothpaste to clean between the two blades in each stack DOUBLES the number of blades actively cutting hair, which doubles the cutting efficiency!\nUsing the \"mirror technique\" can be dangerous, as it can cause the blades to be unevenly sharpened, which may cause them to catch and nick the screen. If the screen gets nicked, it's more likely to allow your skin to slip into it and allow the blades to cut you.\nAlso, this technique is just way quicker and easier than the mirror technique. ;)\nBelieve me yet?\nNo?\nTry it out for yourself, then leave a comment letting us know how it worked for you!\nThen share the tutorial so your friends can benefit from it too!\n<3 - Cassey and Company", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMC/SHF5/JR6OK5Y2/FMCSHF5JR6OK5Y2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F43/MFHM/JRBBPWSK/F43MFHMJRBBPWSK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE7/KQGW/JRBBPSL2/FE7KQGWJRBBPSL2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Some Extra"}], "channel": "Life Hacks"}, {"category": "Home", "description": "Here's a compilation of cool plumbing tricks every homeowner should know.\nStuff I used in this video:\n2000 Grit Wet or Dry Sandpaper: https://amzn.to/2tODDmp\nMilwaukee HoleSaw Kit (28-Piece): https://amzn.to/2T8TF9Q\nMagTorch Butane Soldering Torch: https://amzn.to/2T8TF9Q\nFood Coloring for toilet test: https://amzn.to/2T8TF9Q\n8\" Channel Lock Adjustable Pliers: https://amzn.to/2T8TF9Q\n3/8\" Piggy Back Valve: https://amzn.to/2T8TF9Q\n1/2\" Compression Valve: https://amzn.to/2T8TF9Q", "title": "The ULTIMATE Plumbing Tricks Guide (15+ Tricks)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/The-ULTIMATE-Plumbing-Tricks-Guide-15-Tricks/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "If the water coming into your house is harsh, you might have had this problem happen to you already.

They are a good source of protein, healthy fats, carbohydrates and other healthy minerals. However, you can't just eat them right off the tree, they need to be processed first. Acorns contain tannins in them which make them very bitter and potentially toxic to humans. The tannins need to first be leached out of the Acorns then they can be eaten, Red Oak Acorns contain the highest level of tannins.

However, compare the stated sizes with your door locks to ensure they fit (see the 'technical' drawing attached). If you don\u2019t own a 3D printer, take a look online to find printing services near you.\nI have uploaded not only printable *.stl files but also *.f3d files that may be opened with Fusion 360, so you can follow-up on how I did it (workflow is reversible in the document) and change things according to your needs. If you come up with ideas on how to improve the design, be my guest :)\nThe only thing you will need is either two screws or a connecting piece, such as a piece of wood.", "title": "Old-school Modular Door Securement - Reinvented (+Fusion 360 How To)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Old-school-Modular-Door-Securement-Reinvented-Fusi/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I will split up my instructable into three parts.

Our goal is to have a motor spin at a rate that will generate between about 12 and 15 volts when we are spinning on the exercise bike. RC motors are rated by how many volts they produce per RPM. A 1000Kv motor would need to spin at 1000 RPM to produce 1 volt. To get to our 12-15 volt range in this case, we'd need to spin the motor at 12,000 to 15,000 RPM. Let's get some basic measurements from the spin bike.\n- The circumference of the flywheel on my spin bike is 57 inches\n- Pedaling the spin bike at a comfortable pace rotates the flywheel between 250-350 RPM, which I confirmed using a digital tachometer\nThe BaneBot wheel we chose is 2 7/8 inches diameter = 2.875\". You'll recall that circumference is Pi times diameter. The circumference of this wheel is about 9\".\nIf we take the low end and use 250 RPM and multiply that by the 57 inch circumference of the flywheel, we get 14,250 inches per minute. Dividing the 9\" BaneBot wheel circumference, we get 1583 RPM. We want our motor to produce 11-12 volts at this RPM, so divide by 11 and 12 and get 131.9 and 143.9. So our target motor should be around 140Kv. We found this Balancing Scooter RC motor that fits the bill.\nIf you have a significantly different circumference flywheel, or choose to use a different drive wheel than what I have, you can use the above steps to determine an appropriate motor to use.

These 3 female spade connectors plug into the alternating current spade contacts (marked with a squiggly that looks like an \"S\") on the 3 phase bridge rectifier. Order of connecting these wires doesn't matter. Next we need to come off of the DC plus and minus posts and go into the DC meter (optional, but highly recommended). The Drok meter I used has some wires with alligator clips that seemed to connect securely enough to the rectifier. Maybe I\u2019ll add some spade connectors later. On the output side of the meter, we\u2019ll connect to a 12v socket or two. One socket is easy (use the alligator clips), two or more will need a splitter of some sort. I used some 5 wire connectors I had, but you can splice wires together, use a distribution block, some wire nuts or whatever.\n\nOnce you have it all hooked up, give the bike a spin and see how many volts the meter reads. The goal is to have 11-15 volts, which is ideal for using car socket chargers and inverters. If the voltage is too low, pedal a little faster.

The size of the project box really depends on how many 12 volt sockets you want to use, along with the size of the DC meter. In the project box shown, I put in two 12 volt sockets, a Drok DC meter and the 3 phase bridge rectifier. I could have easily put 2 more sockets in this box. Cutting the hole for the meter was the most challenging, but here's the approach I took. Measure the dimensions of the multi-meter. Place masking tape over the area you plan to cut out for the meter. Measure and mark on the tape where to cut, then use a sharp utility knife cut out the hole. Start gently to be sure to stay on the lines. Keep tracing the lines with the blade, pressing firmer and firmer until you cut through the plastic. I'm sure there is a better way to do this, but with patience this approach works. For socket holes, a 1 3/16\" hole saw does the job very nicely. Drill a hole in the metal backing for the bridge rectifier, and use a nut and bolt to secure. I also used a U bolt to mount the box to the handlebar (measure your handlebar and get the right size U-bolt). A couple more holes in the metal plate will be needed to mount the U bolt. You can either drill another hole in the metal plate for the wires to go through, or you can cut/drill in the side of the plastic box. You can get fancy with a wire clamp if desired.

If, however, you are going to power a TV or other devices through a DC to AC inverter, you'll want to consider adding a battery. One of the nice things about this design is adding a battery to the circuit is quite simple and requires no additional electronics because the 3 phase bridge rectifier acts as a blocking diode (it's actually a circuit made with a handful of diodes), preventing the battery from putting power into and spinning your RC motor! The easiest way to add a 12v battery is with a car power bank or 'jump starter' along with a socket to socket adapter. Plugging in the battery will power the DC meter and provide a voltage reading on the battery. Anytime you are producing more volts that that reading, you're putting amps into the battery and powering your devices. Be careful, however, to not spin so fast that the voltage goes over 15 volts as this could damage the battery.\nAdding the battery will act as a buffer for powering devices that are \"spiky\", in other words, that need a bunch of power to start or during various phases of operation, then settle into a more manageable power draw. I found trying to power a 55\" LED TV was difficult without having the battery as a buffer.

Respect the indications found on the packaging.\nFirst, glue the two 3mm thick washers in the two holes in the 5mm PMMA disc. These two washers must be flush with one of the faces, and as straight as possible. The easiest way to obtain a good result is to put the disc on a rough sheet, to put one or two drops of glue on the outside of the washers, and to place them in the holes (one per hole) by pressing well with the tip of a pen so that the washer goes well to the bottom. Do not use your finger to push, cyanoacrylate glue has the annoying tendency to stick better on the fingers than anywhere else!\nLet it dry for a minute at least, and then glue the first magnets (the 12mm wide discs) by placing a small drop of glue (cyanoacrylate) inside the holes of the PMMA disc, on top of the washers, then depositing the magnets in the holes (one in each hole). Make sure to use a very small drop of glue so as not to clog the washers hole, which will receive the 6mm cylinder magnets.\nBeware, neodymium magnets are very powerful but also quite fragile, and can break if they receive a shock (for example by sticking together). It is also difficult to separate them, so if your magnets are stuck together, start by separating them before applying the glue points.\nAlso try to stick them in the same direction, so that your facades can be interchangeable.\nThen stick the cylindrical magnets on the half of the cross with two notches to accommodate the magnets. To perform this step correctly, turn the disc you have assembled, and put the two magnets in the holes formed by the washers. This keeps them in place and prevents making mistake in the magnets orientation. Position the second part of the cross on the cylinder by inserting the pins in the two rectangular holes provided for this purpose. And now, put a drop of glue in each of the two notches to accommodate the magnets on the first half of the cross and nest it in the other half, until it is in contact with the disc and the cylindrical magnets.\nLet the glue take for a minute, and when you remove the cross the magnets should follow.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 9: Step 9 - Gluing the Support Magnets"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "The last part of the support is a set of four identical flexible metallic tabs.\nThese tabs can be cut in a thin and flexible steel plate (150microns), which bends without scoring.

When we ordered it from our local plumbing shop its description said that it was soundproofed, but when we received the sink we discovered this was stretching the truth a little bit, as the \u201csoundproofing\u201d consisted of four thin rubber rectangles glued to the bottom of each bowl (see the second photo).\nLike any good nerd, I searched the Internet for a better solution and found many, including from spray on foam, automotive undercoating, and pickup truck bed liner. All of these solutions required careful masking, followed by a generally messy application of the product - all with mixed results. I am happy to say that the product that I used requires no masking, is easy to apply and works wonderfully - if you tap the inside of our new sink all you will hear is a dull thud.\nWhat I used is 3M Automotive Sound Reduction Mat, a self-adhesive, flexible mat that is designed to reduce road noise and vibration. It is often applied to the inside of the door panels when installing automotive stereo systems, but it also works great on stainless steel sinks. You can find the 3M or equivalent product at most automotive supply stores or from a car stereo shop. The 3M product is a semi-stiff sheet about an eighth-inch thick with a black shiny finish and a diamond pattern. It is self-adhesive, protected by a peel off backing.

I was interested with it right away, because on its pages I found a lot of interesting schematic pictures. I decided to certainly read it. Being a little boy, I still did not know what impact this book will make on me in the future.\nYears went by. I tried myself in different professions and by the will of fate I changed my city. Together with my wife, we settled in a small colorful and historic town, where crafts are valued. And that's what happened. Who would have thought that 20 years later the same book about the history of airships met me at a flea market 700 km far from home? I felt myself warm and comfortable as soon as I picked it up. Airships! That\u2019s what I wanted to use for the basis of the lamp, which I had long dreamed of doing. At first I was looking for a long time, which model to choose.

In order to fix the 4 tail blades I would have to develop a special belt for fastening 4 blades, and even more - every detail would need to be fixed in two places. This means that two additional belts are needed. I decided to go a simpler way: attach the tail blades on the arcs themselves. All I needed to do was to change the number of arcs to a multiple of four, which means 12 or 16 arcs. 16 arcs - sounds great! So the design will be stronger, not so angular. In addition, more parts will make the design more complicated and as for me more beautiful.\nIt was also necessary to rethink the system of fastening parts together. For this, I decided to develop a special clip that wouldmake \u201ca click\u201d to hold the two parts together.\nThe cardboard model was divided into 4 compartments, I decided to divide the plastic body frame into 5 compartments. Also, bulkheads between the compartments were heavily reworked, holes for lighting installation were added.\nIn order to connect the parts together I needed to develop plastic spring clips. The idea is this: the clamp must freely pass through two layers of plastic to expand on the other side. To do this, the clamp must be flexible, but at the same time be strong, securely connecting parts together.\nIn the course of working on it, I tried more than 20 options before it worked properly. Too thin locks broke at the first touch, thick ones broke due to the fact that they bent badly and didn\u2019t want to fit in any way, but a suitable variant was finally found. It was possible to begin work on the tail blades.\nWith the empennage was a bit easier, its shape was easy to repeat from photographs and drawings. Installation on the ship also did not cause problems. It was necessary only to change four of the sixteen tail arcs, adding to them increased clamps. In addition, I developed a special hinge for the vertical tail blades. It will allow them to rotate in the range of 10-15 degrees.\nThen I started drawing two parts for the open hatch on top of the airship for the release of warm air from the heated lamps and fasteners for electrical wiring inside the airship.\nAnd here we are - all the drawings are ready, all connections are tested.

For this I will use tissue-paper. Unfortunately, I could not find enough long sheets of paper, and I would have to glue them together. For sticking paper, I will use double-sided tape, 3mm thick. I will glue them one by another - 16 sectors that form the outer surface of the airship.\nTo start I cut the paper into 3 inch wide strips. Then I glue the two strips together. Now glue the two strips of tape to the longitudinal edges of the airship, and fasten a long strip of paper on them. When the paper is fixed in the right place, cut off the excess paper and repeat all operations with the following sectors. The upper two sectors are not completely covered with paper. This was done on purpose so that the hot air from the lamps would have a place to go.\nNow, when the airship is covered with paper, you need to pull the paper to remove the folds on it. The trick is to wet all paper quickly and evenly as possible. If you apply water too slowly and unevenly, then the paper will begin to tear and you will need to repeat everything from the very beginning. To quickly moisten the paper, I will use a spray bottle with an additional pump. It is able to release 1 liter of water in just seconds. I hope this is enough.

Now you can press the cone into the center of the frame with polystyrene.The plastic will exactly repeat the shape of the cone; you just need to wait a few minutes for it to cool. Now I cut off all unnecessary, grind and give final shape. It remains to cover the white matte paint. That's all, the parts of the airship are fully prepared, you only need to fasten the caps, install the socket for lamps and conduct the wiring.\nThe only thing that this airship lacks for it to become a lamp is the basis. For it, I used a 0.5-inch-thick walnut board. On a laser engraver, I cut the plywood according to the shape of the future base, then with a mill I copied the plywood form onto the board, added several acrylic parts imitating the airship hull, and installed hooks for the airship suspension.

I recon something like motor from windshield wipers would do better. As you will see later, the whole apparatus is modular and non invasive to the table, so it would be extremely easy to replace the motor with any other motor.\nFor the controller board, I happen to have CyPress CY8CKIT-145-40XX PSoC\u00ae 4000S CapSense Prototyping Kit.

Since I couldn't find any datasheet for the motor, I went with a scientific guess and picked up a 15A PSU and 16A motor driver. Yes I know that the PSU should have had a higher current capabilities, but remember \"Poor's..\". My scientific guess was that the motor will not get into such high loads anyway, and later it was proven to be so. Even better, when I was later testing it - under extreme load turned out that the motor probably has a thermo cutoff relay, as when it would get too hot, it would turn off, and would be working again later when it would cool. But more on that later. I must say that in the finished version of the project no motor, or any other component overheats, or is pushed to work in harsh conditions.\nThe Motor Controller has input for direction control (which is crucial for standing desk application, as you also might want to get your desk back down) and PWM control of RPM.\nLastly, to power the CyPress controller board, I had some homemade 12V->5V DC/DC converter laying around.

Needless to say, that did not work, as it was not possible to achieve necessary tension for the belt not to slip. So instead I decided to go for a timing belt and a gear set after it.\nThe belt drive was chose, so that in case of overload rather let the belt slip than sending power to the table mechanism and potentially damaging it, or even damaging the motor. Since the motor mound was kept from the first prototype, I had to play a bit with the distances between all the shafts in order to get the gears match and the belt drive to fall into a category of standart of the shelf components.\nThe driven pulley of a belt drive is mounted on the same shaft with spur gear. I've chose the ratio of 2.875:1 using previously mentioned scientific guess. It turned out well, the motor is more than capable to handle this ratio, though if I would be designing the system again, I would use a higher one. Or at least have some scientific trials.\nThe first components I designed was the so called \"Motor Adaptor\". The part that fits the shape of the motors original gear, and a square tube that we'll be driving with it. I suppose to handle a lot of force, so I made it quite beefy. There is also a spur gear teeth, that I put there just in case I want to drive something else later from there. One idea was to make some kind of limit switch screw assembly. But I didn't get to that part.\nSpeaking of limit switches. So far there is no limit switches in the system, and fail prevention is in hands of belt slip. Although, it would be easy to add a down position limit switch, it's a bit more complicated with the up position. Since the table legs that go up are kind of an outer shell, so there is nothing to push against when we are in the up position. This is why I was thinking of some kind of scaled down worm screw that would be synced with the table movement. Alternatively, one could put a current sensor on the motor, but I just didn't have one, so I don't even know would the current changes be suitable to detect the limit positions reliably. Some kind of encoder also would be an option, but then we need to store the position of the table in some kind of memory, and be sure that the position of encoder will not go out of sync.

The middle part is made to hold the second bearing of the hex shaft as closely to the spur gear as possible. The first hex key that I've sacrificed to the mission turned out to be not entirely straight and it introduced some mechanical resistance. The next hex key was not so long, only about 70mm long, so I had to push everything closer, thus the second bearing ended up on a intermediate frame. I strongly recommend first to examine the hex key, before cutting, if you have some tools to evaluate straightness - even better.

Considering how slow the raising speed turned out, it would be extremely inconvenient otherwise. The funny part is, that I've also directly send slider input to PWM, meaning that slider has a range of -100 to 0 and to +100, so you can change the speed of the motor. It's not at all useful, and the motor is so slow, but I thought it's a bit more fun this way. And it also serves as a sort-of soft start, since you can only start the motor from 0 position.

When you opened the wall you can always add some studs and cross bracing at precisely the right height and vertical location.\nNOTE: there is a drawing coming up a few steps from now that shows how the hinges, flapper and TV should fit. Please take a look.\nThe hinge pivot point should be even with or slightly higher than the top of the TV, but not too much higher else the hinges will be visible to people standing in the room. You need for the TV to rotate slightly past horizontal without jamming into the wall, so either build out the hinges away from the wall (which will allow over-rotation), or locate the hinges 1/2\" to 1\" higher than the TV, but be mindful that the will be visible to people able to see over the TV. The goal is to make the TV seem as if it is floating on the wall while also able to rotate to horizontal (actually the TV doesn't need to rotate to horizontal, it just needs to be out of the way, you can adjust the measurements to make it whatever works for you).\nWith the TV on the ground and safely supported, attach the wall mount hardware to measure the distance from top of TV to bottom of hardware attach point, this determines the minimum height of your plywood flapper.

Without support close to the hinge point the metal will bend. So I drilled and countersunk a 3rd hole to help prevent the hinge from bending due to stress.\nDon't skimp on attaching the hinges. On the flapper side, drill through the plywood and use bolts with washers, lock washers and nuts to attach the hinge to the flapper. Regular wood screws will likely pull out, so go all the way through and use nuts on the other side (my opinion only).\nOn the wall side attach the hinge to the wall stud using as heavy a wood screw as you can find, as deep as possible.

So I built 2x 1\" thick blocks of wood by gluing some 1/4\" and 3/4\" plywood together.\nWith the hinge in the fully down position there is about 1/4\" clearance between the bracket and the wall, which means when in the closed (down) position the strut attach point at the to will be about 3/8\" from the wall and the bottom strut attach point will be 7/8\", resulting in a net positive close pressure of a couple ounces.

I used Fusion 360 to create this diagram but you don't need to be so fancy. The key thing here is to measure the distance from the hinge pivot point to the center of gravity of the TV/mount assembly to determine the moment (force times distance).\nOur TV + mount + plywood flapper weighs just about 50 lb (222 Newtons). The distance from the hinge pivot point (not the wall) to the center of gravity of the TV is 15.75 in (40 cm). Multiply these 2 values together to determine the moment:\nMoment = Force x Distance = 50 x 15.75 = 788 in-lb (908 kg-cm)\nAdd 10-15% for holding the TV safely when the struts are fully extended:\nMoment + 10% = 778 + 78 = 856 in-lb (1000 kg-cm)\nThe struts must produce a minimum upward force equal to 856 in-lb (1000 kg-cm). Since we are using 2 struts you can divide the total needed by 2, therefore each strut must provide enough vertical lifting force to support a moment of 428 in-lb (500 kg-cm). That's the moment, but since you don't know how far the strut will be from the hinge you don't know how much force your strut needs.\nNow you can begin searching for a suitable gas strut on the Internets, for example one manufacturer is Suspa which are available on Amazon, other manufacturers are also available. Find a family of struts with the same extension dimensions but providing different forces, so sizing the strut will be easy. There are 3 values you need to be concerned about: the collapsed length, the overall length and the length of travel.\nThe Suspa C16 strut family is 19.7 in (50 cm) extended, 11.8 in (30 cm) collapsed, which gives a length of travel of 7.9 in (20 cm)\nLength of Travel = Extended length - Collapsed length = 19.7 - 11.8 = 7.9 in (20 cm)\nYou now have the dimensions you need to mount the strut. Make the hinged attachment point on the flapper equal to the length of travel and the fixed attachment point on the wall equal to the collapsed length plus the length of travel. Refer to the drawing. Both dimensions are from the hinge pivot point.\nHinged distance = Length of travel = 7.9 in (20 cm)\nFixed distance = Collapsed length + Length of travel = 18.7 in (47.5 cm)\nSince we now know where the strut attaches to the flapper we can calculate how much force the strut must provide to create the moment that is needed to lift and hold the TV. Remember the moment at the attach point must equal or exceed the moment at the TV's center of gravity. We already determined that each strut must provide 428 in-lb (500 kg-cm) of moment.\nStrut force x 7.9 in = 428 in-lb (moment for each individual strut)\nStrut force = 428 / 7.9 = 54 lb (241 Newtons)\nThe closest match from this manufacturer appears to be 60 lb force struts. Gas struts are made in many lengths and forces so explore around before settling on a particular manufacturer.\nNOTE FOR THE ENGINEERING-MINDED:\nThe strut's force is along its axis, which for this configuration when fully extended is at a 24 degree angle. The force consists of a vertical and horizontal component. The vertical force component is 60 lb x cos(24) = 55 lb with a horizontal shear force component of 24 lb (60 x sin(24)). Working backwards, with a 55 lb vertical force x 2 at 7.9 in from the hinge pivot point results in an actual lifting moment of 869 in-lb when the flapper is at 90 degrees, or about 12% more than the minimum required of 778 in-lb, so we are still within our requirement of 10-15% extra lift to keep the TV up in the fully extended position. 869 in-lb of moment works out to be 55 lbs of upward force at the TV's center of gravity, which means approximately 5 pounds of downward force will be needed to close the assembly from its fully extending position.\nHere are some useful conversions from English to Metric measurements:\n\n1 pound weight = 4.443 Newtons\n1 inch = 2.54 centimeters = 25.4 millimeters", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1D/JC8D/JQ6YGHWY/F1DJC8DJQ6YGHWY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF5/DMCY/JQ6YGS3B/FF5DMCYJQ6YGS3B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKG/A8BT/JQCOBUXA/FKGA8BTJQCOBUXA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Sizing the Struts"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "Don't get into too big of a hurry to install your struts, they come fully extended and require A LOT of force to collapse. So unless you want to work underneath your TV or a bunch of lead weights, installing the struts too early will mean that without the TV you will need about 55 lbs of force to close the assembly. Until you hang the TV it will be better to use a tall support to hold your assembly up.\nThe struts attach to a standard 10mm ball bracket. There are different styles of brackets, choose the one that best suits your installation. The bent ones are for attaching to a flat surface such as our flapper and wall, the straight one can attach onto the side of a stud.\nThe brackets we used extend 1-1/8\" from the surface with the ball joint at 7/8\". We already built spacers to mount the hinges 1-1/4\" from the wall so the flapper should hang vertically. Mount the brackets on the flapper in line with the strut attach point to the wall, in our case everything is aligned on the wall studs supporting each hinge, but you can vary it (you could for example mount the struts inside or outside the hinge points).\nTip: after calculating the strut mount locations, install the top strut brackets on the underside of the flapper. Then press the struts (hydraulic end on top) onto the brackets so that they hang down. Lift the flapper to a horizontal (or near horizontal) position. Be careful about rotating up past 90 degrees unless you allowed for it when you calculated the top position of your TV, else it might hit the wall. Do not insert the bottom bracket all the way into the bottom of the strut, just hold it in place, and carefully mark its position on the wall or stud where you plan to install the bottom bracket (it should align itself to the diagram shown earlier but in case you made a slight error this will catch it.

I am sure there are others like it, this is the one we settled upon. What makes this one work well is it has its own power supply via a USB connector (hence it is \"active\") so produces a consistent, bring IR signal. The power strip we installed earlier has a couple USB outlets so it was a simple matter to plug it in, then route the input sensor to the bottom front of the TV, attached with some double-sided tape. The emitter was placed opposite the DVR's infra-red sensor location, again with double-sided tape.

I recommend having a few garden stake in spare in case you end up damaging one beyond use.\n1 - While holding each side of the pool noodle against the two facing side of your gate where you walk in, choose a curvature that looks nice to you.\n2 - Use a cable tie to secure temporally the noodle to your gate\n3 - Using duct tape, attach together at the top, in the center and at the bottom the garden stake. I didn't do it on mine and trying to have both stake taking the same shape was a real nightmare. You do not need to wrap them together, you just need to make sure that you can bend them together.\n4 - While using only the strength of your hands, carefully bend the stake to match the curvature that your pool noodle is taking. It's better if they are slightly less bent than needed. That will allow the arch to keep a sturdy shape when installed. This step must be done very carefully : the garden stake are extremely sturdy, they are made of a hollow metallic pipe however, applying to much force will result in the stake doing a pinch ( see picture ). If that happens to you, cut that part out and try again by slowly applying force to curve the stakes. You will not need the all size of the garden stake, but keep in mind that you will have to leave at least 5 to 6 inches stikking out on each side to secure the arch to your fence posts.\nI was lucky enough to only trash one in the previous step.\n5 - Separate the garden stakes and take each side in one hand.

Keep the PVC pipe inside one\n3 - Carefully insert one of the garden stake inside one of the pool noodle. Do no hesitate to bend the pool noodle to insert the stake. If you pierce the noodle by accident, just pull it back and continue. Make sure that at least 5 to 6 inches of the garden stake is stiking out at the bottom, where we will use cable ties later on (to attach it to the fence post).\n4 - Make sure that the garden stake you have inserted is also about 2 inches inside the PVC pipe that will be between the 2 noodles.\n5 - Repeat step 3 and 4 with the other side.\n6 - Once you are happy with the result, insert the 2 remaining pieces of PVC pipe inside each side of the pool noodles. This will allow the garden stake to not move at all after being installed on the fence post and gives a better grip for the cable ties.\n7 - Attach the 2 pool noodles together like in the previous steps and use duct tape to secure the top part.\nNow that we have completed the structure itself, all we have to do is to wrap our ribbon around the pool noodle.\n1 - Tightly pass over the ribbon 3 times on the side that you have decided to start from.\n2 - Wrap the noodle with the ribbon on an angle. Make sure it's thight and that you are always slightly overlapping edge of the ribbon.\n3 - Once arrived at the end, once again, pass over 3 times and make sure it's thight.\n4 - Secure ribbon with a cable tie on each end.

I used a single cable tie for that.\nFor this, wrap the garland around the top part of your fence post and the bottom outward part of each side of the arch while trying to create a ball shape. You are going to need to do a fee paths on each side to completely hide the garden stakes and the cable ties.\nOnce this is one, you can use of what's left of the garland to go wrap you arch.

I was fortunate enough that I have a part of the string of lights I'm using on my fence left. I didn't know what to do with it, so it was buried in the fence post top.

This is by far the most common and up to code way of repairing a leaky copper pipe but requires some soldering. This should be your first go-to method for fixing a burst, perforation or pinhole in any case. To do it, all you need is 2 couplings the same size as the pipe, and a piece of pipe. If your water isn\u2019t already shut off, go ahead and close it before starting the fix. Cut out the damaged area using a pipe cutter and deburr the inside of the pipe before assembling everything together, you could either use a dedicated pencil reamer like this one or you could simply use a utility knife to get the pipe back to its original size. If for whatever reason the pipes don\u2019t have any play in them like this, you\u2019ll need what they call a repair coupling which doesn\u2019t have a stopper in it like normal couplings would. This allows for you to slip it on the pipe as such to be able to fit the new piece of pipe in place. Once you got it in place, pull the coupling back onto the pipe, ensuring that both pipes meet in the middle of the coupling, then proceed to soldering. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with soldering, I have an easy to follow, step by step guide on how to do so, this video helped out thousands of people learn how to solder just after watching it 1 time, so I\u2019ll put the link right here (How to solder) for you to watch it.

At our home, the season starts just before advent \u2013 with the first advent wreath which is a wreath with four candles and you're supposed to light one on each Sunday before Christmas Day, starting four Sundays before. When I was a child my mom used to take me to the advent workshops where we created the wreaths in a really nice pre-Christmas ambient.

I use preferably thuya because it doesn\u2019t hurt my fingers but if you want a wreath that smells really great, use the spruce, although in this case use a pair of gloves.\nDecorations depend completely on your taste, just get them accordingly to the colors and style of your wreath. As I said, I prefer the natural looking ones, therefore, I decorate them with cones, nuts, dried orange slices, cinnamon, star anise and bows in the color of the candles.\n\nBefore you start let\u2019s create the ambient.

You won\u2019t be covering the bottom side of the base and it\u2019s important that you place the whole layer at the same time. As you can see, I hold the layer so that it covers the top, inner and outer side. (photo 1)\nThen wrap the wire twice around the twigs just a few centimeter from the ends of the twigs. The end of the wire should reach the bottom side of the base. Leave it loose at first but once you have the twigs wrapped, wrap also the end of the wire under and over the two wraps a few times and then stick the end of the wire in the bottom of the base.

materials I will be using such as the cardboard, paint, lamps & glue need to be safe for the cats.\nIn consequence, as You will see, I had to make several design modifications and revisions such as :

measure the thickness of the cardboard you chose, (preferably double-layered cardboard to prevent warping), after that, divide the tree into layers of that thickness like in the photo, and number them down to track them easily.\nAfter that, Divide the tree into 4 sections, to make it manageable for the steps to come.\nOnce done, transfer the measurements onto an excel sheet and verify that all the layers are accounted for.\n[Optional] : Group the layers in the excel sheet in a way that will allow you to cut many circles of different sizes (a circle within a circle) within the same cardboard

There are tons of designs and layouts, and building one instead of just buying it was always a criteria.\nThe towers, however, all had the same issue for us: where to put one? We wanted it to be tall enough so the cats could walk/jump to the very top, that it should [hopefully] reach the ceiling, and also be in a spot that doesn't take away from the room. The towers do have quite a foot print (we figured at least 2.5 square feet), so it was a concern.\nWhile wondering about this we also realized that we had an under-used closet area underneath our basement staircase. Over the years it ended up just being a dumping spot for old toys, storage bins, etc. Re-purposing the closet as a \"built-in\" cat tower would save us the floor space needed for this, and provide an excellent opportunity to de-clutter, so off we went!", "title": "A Cat Chalet; Why Not?", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/A-Cat-Chalet-Why-Not/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Sketchup was the tool of choice for the design step, especially since they have a free version offered online (https://www.sketchup.com/products/sketchup-free). There are plenty of good tutorials and videos online on how to use that tool, so I won't go though that here. The basic steps, though, were to take measurements of the inside of the closet, use them to create a new project area, and then just play around with different layout ideas.\nFor the requirements - we knew we wanted to have several floors, have plenty of scratching surfaces, easy access from one floor to the next, and hopefully a good way to keep the littler box and food in there as well while having an easy way to maintain and clean the place. Because of the layout of the closet, some of the floors would end up being quite deep so we also wanted to ensure easy access to the back of the closet (for cleanup).\nThe materials were pretty straight forward; we weren't trying to over-engineer the project, so using up any scraps we had on hand was a definite possibility. I opted for using 0.5\" OSB (Oriented Strand Board) as the material of choice for the shelves because it's relatively strong, cheap (a 4' by 8' board costs around $12) and can be easily re-enforced from the bottom with strips of wood cut out of 2 by 4 beams (for long sections that start having a bit of bow in them). This project needed two 4'x8' boards.\nCarpeting: I looked around quite a bit for ideas, and considered using a second hand carpet that I could cut up into sections, but I was concerned about fraying along the edges and the actual aesthetics of having random parts of the original carpet's design show up around the shelves. In the end, I found a carpet runner that was sold by the linear foot and was 26\" wide. The runner was on sale for a bit over $2 a foot, and 30' of the material did the job.\nThe only other purchases we needed to make were hinges to attach the ramps (abut $4 for a pair, and we needed two) and plastic casters for the roll-out shelf the litter box would go on (about $2 each). Each of the casters is rated for about 40lbs, so all together they were more than enough to hold up the shelf, bin and cats.\nTool-wise, having a table saw really helped here but the cutting does not have to be 100% precise since the edges will end up covered by the carpeting, so you could definitely do with a circular saw or even a jigsaw (OSB cuts extremely easily). You'll also need a drill and impact driver, glue and a staple gun with 3/8\" staples (for attaching the carpeting to the shelves).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYB/SQ4X/JPQTCWJ0/FYBSQ4XJPQTCWJ0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8S/06LO/JPQTCWIZ/F8S06LOJPQTCWIZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIP/RGX3/JPQTCWIY/FIPRGX3JPQTCWIY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCY/APCC/JPQTCWIX/FCYAPCCJPQTCWIX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD7/4HPP/JPQTD4O6/FD74HPPJPQTD4O6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXT/HBGL/JPQTCX1S/FXTHBGLJPQTCX1S.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Planning and Materials"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Prep is pretty straight forward: empty the closet and clean it up.\nThe first step is installing the cleats, long horizontal strips of wood attached to the wall upon which the shelves will sit. As far as permanent attachments are concerned, the only ones in this project are between the cleats and the walls. The shelves just sit on the cleats and stay there under their own weight.\nTo attach the cleats, use a stud finder to locate the studs in the wall, and ensure you screw right into them. I used left over 2x2 beams for the cleats and was concerned about splitting while putting the screws through them, so opted to pre-drill them.\nOnce the cleats are on, move on to cutting the shelves to size. I had the boards pre-cut at the store to a size slightly larger than the final dimensions (for easier transportation and to be able to fine-tune the cuts at home through fitting trials). It's important at this stage to keep future maintenance in mind, so think about how you'll get to the back of the closet for cleaning. If any of the shelves are too deep (such as the first and second ones in our case), consider making the shelves in two (or more) sections that you can lift out of place independently, and leaving a gap between those sections to accommodate the carpeting material that will wrap around each section (I left about 0.5\").\nWhen you've got the shelves cut to size, it's time to mark the locations of the openings for the ramps and cut the ramps themselves. In our case, I knew I wanted the openings 6\" away from the wall but was not sure how long they would need to be, so started small to be safe. The initial size of the openings was 6\" by 12\", and after cutting them and dry fitting the shelves I had the cats play in the closet for a while to see what they thought. It looked a bit tight at times, so I ended up with 6\" by 18\" openings instead.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FL0/TQPJ/JPQTCWLG/FL0TQPJJPQTCWLG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC7/X7YO/JPQTCWLH/FC7X7YOJPQTCWLH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3O/IPPD/JPQTCWMF/F3OIPPDJPQTCWMF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F18/YB4E/JPQTCWNX/F18YB4EJPQTCWNX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXM/T0XD/JPQTCWPI/FXMT0XDJPQTCWPI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7J/8HN1/JPQTCWR0/F7J8HN1JPQTCWR0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Preparing the Closet and Cutting the Shelves"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The OSB board is sturdy enough in small sections, but at a width of 2' or so you can start seeing a definite \"give\" when you press in the middle; try positioning it on two objects spaced apart as wide as the board is, and press in the middle to see how flexible it is. To solve this, I needed wooden runners attached in both directions, but the job was cut in half by realizing that the cleats on the wall would also act as runners, so I just needed additional ones going in the perpendicular sense (i.e. from wall to wall).\nThe runners are made from simple 1x2 strips, and I had extra 2x2 and 2x4 pieces lying around that I just ripped to the size on the table saw. Once they were ready, I glued them to the underside of the shelves and ramps, clamped them in the place, flipped the whole thing over and screwed them in from the top. Attaching the screws from the top has the advantage of hiding the screw heads underneath the carpet.\nIn addition to the runners, a small piece was also needed at the top of the ramp as well as near the start of the hole in the corresponding shelves in order to later attach the hinges (since the OSB is too thin and will not hold the screws very well on its own).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWP/LLZE/JPQTCWR1/FWPLLZEJPQTCWR1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUT/7PBI/JPQTCWT9/FUT7PBIJPQTCWT9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ6/WJ7C/JPQTCWWA/FQ6WJ7CJPQTCWWA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRI/5Q5V/JPQTCWWB/FRI5Q5VJPQTCWWB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYQ/I65P/JPQTCWWF/FYQI65PJPQTCWWF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBC/1HMI/JPQTCWZU/FBC1HMIJPQTCWZU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Reinforcements"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The litter box level is composed of two parts: the tray that holds the litter box, which has raised lips to catch any litter being kicked out of the box and is mounted on casters for easy moving in and out of the closet (in order to clean the litter box), and surrounding \"filler\" platforms that are the height of the raised tray's lips. The whole look ends up being that of a large shelf area with a sunken front/center section, upon which the litter box sits. When a cleaning is called for, you just roll that center/front section out of the closet, deal with the cleaning, and roll it back. Simple.\nThe tray starts out as any of the other shelves have, by having the support slats attached to the underside edges with glue and screws, but this time the slats cover all four sides since there's nothing else there to hold them up. When this is complete, four additional pieces of OSB are attached to the sides of the tray to form the skirt. The skirt is basically tall enough to protrude 0.5\" above the height of the tray, and reach within 0.5\" of the very bottom of the casters. This has the effect of creating a top lip to contain spilled litter, and is raised slightly above the floor to prevent scratching when the tray is rolled around.\nFor consistent attachment height, I put the tray upside down on a two scrap pieces of OSB (basically lifting it 0.5\" off the work surface), and glued/screwed the skirts sections to the edges of the tray while making sure the skirt was actually touching the work surface. The skirt corners were also glued to each other, but here I used finishing nails instead of screws to avoid blowing the board apart. When the skirt was complete, the casters were attached to the wooden slats at each corner while ensuring they had enough clearance to swing free of the skirt.\nSurrounding the tray are three additional sections that are as high as the top edge of the tray's lips, and they're extremely straight forward: the reinforcement strips are added underneath them, but those strips are pilled up until the necessary overall height is achieved. Also, the slats are needed the full length of these sections where they meet up with the central tray so as to not leave a gap when the tray is moved out, but in the back (where those sections meet the wall) only a couple of pieces are needed for support (I added them in the corners only, and it was more than enough to support the cats' weight).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FR5/Q7SR/JPQTCX3P/FR5Q7SRJPQTCX3P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM7/G1ZI/JPQTCX5M/FM7G1ZIJPQTCX5M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSW/63OU/JPQTD4DX/FSW63OUJPQTD4DX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV7/3GKN/JPQTD4E0/FV73GKNJPQTD4E0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKV/2A4B/JPQTD4E1/FKV2A4BJPQTD4E1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4D/B3XD/JPQTD4E2/F4DB3XDJPQTD4E2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHC/F9W1/JPQTD4E3/FHCF9W1JPQTD4E3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDE/RD1M/JPQTD4E4/FDERD1MJPQTD4E4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAU/THWR/JPQTD4EW/FAUTHWRJPQTD4EW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD0/KXL4/JPQTD4FL/FD0KXL4JPQTD4FL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWL/LU8C/JPQTD4GA/FWLLU8CJPQTD4GA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Litter Box Tray"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The ramps, with the support slats attached, have a 90\u00b0 edge on both the top and bottom, which makes attaching them to their shelf and lying flat on the shelf below pretty challenging. To get around this, I cut the corner off to match the angle, and used a quick diagram like the one attached here.\nStarting off with the overall measurement of the opening angle being at 145\u00b0 (A) (yes, I'm rounding the values, but the difference is minor and is not noticeable), I can bring a line straight down from the middle of that angle, dividing it in two angles, 90\u00b0 (B) and the remainder of 55\u00b0 (C). Since the ramp is parallel to the left side of the protractor, bringing down another vertical line from the corner of the ramp downwards gives me angle (D) which matches angle (C) at 55\u00b0. And knowing that the full angle of the ramp's corner is 90\u00b0, subtracting angle (D) from it gives me 35\u00b0 (E), the angle I need to remove.\nOnce that corner is cut off, follow the same mechanism with bottom of the ramp to make it flat with the lower shelf, cut that corner off, and we're done with all the cutting. Time for a dry fit of everything and making any last minute adjustments to ensure everything works.\nThe final step, after both ends of the ramp have been cut at the proper angles, is to join the ramp and shelf with a hinge.

All the shelves and ramps went through pretty much the same process for this: starting underneath the shelf, I attached the carpet to the runner with staples. For stapling in general, start in the middle of the piece being attached and work your way outwards; this helps ensure no fabric \"waves\" are caught in the middle.\nWith one end stapled, the shelf was inverted, pulling the carpet along. The carpet was then wrapped tightly around the opposite side of the shelf and stapled to the second runner. If the shelf was also a front one with a raised edge, the carpet was then stapled to the inside of that lip to keep it all tight. Extra strips were then cut and stapled in the same manner on the sides of the shelf, to cover the areas that were beyond the full width of the carpet runner.\nIf the shelf had an opening for a ramp, the hole was cut from underneath in the shape of an \"X\", and the resulting triangles were folded tightly and stapled to the underside of the shelf.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLH/4P2E/JPQTD4KN/FLH4P2EJPQTD4KN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEY/PNHB/JPQTD4KO/FEYPNHBJPQTD4KO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCL/S0MV/JPSO0JXN/FCLS0MVJPSO0JXN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXR/TK4O/JPSO0JXQ/FXRTK4OJPSO0JXQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKO/7R64/JPSO0JXU/FKO7R64JPSO0JXU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKO/QXSC/JPSO0JXW/FKOQXSCJPSO0JXW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLO/MYIX/JPSO0JXR/FLOMYIXJPSO0JXR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBE/F594/JPSO0JYG/FBEF594JPSO0JYG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYZ/2HE7/JPSO0JY1/FYZ2HE7JPSO0JY1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTR/E07E/JPSO0JXX/FTRE07EJPSO0JXX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY0/6RE9/JPSO0JY4/FY06RE9JPSO0JY4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8F/ZHQZ/JPSO0JY8/F8FZHQZJPSO0JY8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN1/26V7/JPSO0JY9/FN126V7JPSO0JY9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Painting, Carpeting and Final Setup"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "And that was it.

Mine is for the front yard to be viewed from the sidewalk or street. I was concerned it might be too small, but that size works fine for that purpose.\n1/4 inch plywood is likely best as it's rather easy to cut. The thicker the wood, the sturdier, but the heavier and the more difficult to cut.\nDraw it Out\nDraw out your outline from the sketch you did on paper. I used a pencil and simply eyeballed and sketched on the plywood. There's no need to be neat because it'll be painted over--feel free to draw and re-draw and then re-re-draw until it looks right. Also, don't fool with minor details...they're hard to cut and won't likely be seen anyway. It's the general shape that is desired. Imagine a silhouette of two lovers watching a sunset. The details are not seen, only the general outlines of the individuals are.\nIf drawing is a challenge, feel free to use my sketch (or a different outline). Print it out on paper. Then use the art technique known as the Grid Drawing Method. In essence, you draw a grid over the original on paper. Likewise, you'd draw a grid on your plywood with the same number of rows and columns. You you simply draw what you see in each square, one-by-one. It's surprising how accurately and easily you can replicate a drawing.

Pour the roll-on-texture into a painting tray and roll your brush in until it is evenly coated.\nNow depending on the desired look you are going for you need to watch how much you apply on the brick.

When I whitewash brick I tend to adjust my direction with the way the roll on texture is working with. Sometimes if you are not careful the putty knife can leave noticeable lines which is why I move in the direction it flows in to make it look more complete and finished, but if you like the streaks of lines then that's your prerogative.\nI included a gif of a technique I use when the roll-on-texture is almost dry.

The first thing you'll need to do is figure out how you want your display to work. I listed 2 sheets of acrylic to use, only because I chose to have one float on top of the other. I wanted my first image to pop off the sheet from the second, almost like it's hovering on top, giving it a 3D image. I also wanted the light to only show through the symbol. If you don't want that, you can simplify this project by only using one sheet of acrylic.\nAnother point I'd like to make here. I've tried to highlight leaving 'the wrappers' on the acrylic sheets. You can use these sheets to your advantage. In the video below, you can see how I cut and spray painted the plastic on the acrylic sheets. By flipping it over, I was able to use 2 different colors of spray paint, one on each side, which really made it easy to create my picture.\nClick here for an idea of what I'm talking about.\nWith that out of the way...with the decision as to how you want to proceed is laid out, find an image you want to cut out and let's move on...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F04/NBL8/JPN3O6I9/F04NBL8JPN3O6I9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQE/M7X7/JPN3O6JN/FQEM7X7JPN3O6JN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Painting Your New Image"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "After I found the image on the internet that I was searching for, I used a free, brilliant little program Mathias Wandel put together that will enlarge a picture and allow you to print off that image in sequential order on your printer.

After the tape was adhered, I cut around the border of the picture and taped that entire picture on the top of my unpeeled acrylic sheet.\nIt's fast, but this is how I taped my images together, cut and then adhered it to the acrylic sheet.\nMatthias Wandel's FREE Big Print Program", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLK/XXIH/JPN3O6YO/FLKXXIHJPN3O6YO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFW/MX9P/JPN3O70R/FFWMX9PJPN3O70R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBW/ZAMC/JPN3O72N/FBWZAMCJPN3O72N.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Working With the Image We've Selected."}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Okay, now that we've hunkered down our pattern, I placed my acrylic sheet over a couple 2x4's with an LED light below so that I could see the print through the plastic.

This gave me a protective layer against the spray paint mist that was to come while exposing the parts I wanted painted.\nWhy not just cut on the print side? I used both sides of the acrylic sheet to do different things. While one side served as the gray paint surrounding the symbol, I flipped it over to the opposite side to cut out the actual symbol. With spray paint, this works really well, so long as you're only using 2 colors. If you're using something different, removing the plastic film and directly tracing or painting would be the smart route.\nOnce I had a side finished, and spray painted, I waited till it was dry before peeling off the protective layer. I finished the opposite side, allowed that to dry and then peeled that off. I then used a paintbrush and added a touch of glow in the dark paint to cover just the symbol, giving it an eerie glow after the lights went out.\nWith my second sheet of acrylic, again, optional, I peeled off the protective layer of plastic and spray painted it a solid black color.\nMarking, Peeling and Finally Painting", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FU4/Y7YO/JPN3O8CF/FU4Y7YOJPN3O8CF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F74/YPRO/JPN3O8CH/F74YPROJPN3O8CH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMS/WVNN/JPN3O8NO/FMSWVNNJPN3O8NO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR6/HD20/JPN3O8NZ/FR6HD20JPN3O8NZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGE/UCJI/JPN3O8O0/FGEUCJIJPN3O8O0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSM/JCYR/JPN3O9A0/FSMJCYRJPN3O9A0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Cutting, Peeling and Painting"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "If you want to do what I have done by adding this additional sheet, there's not much to this step.

I also wanted the top of the frame to be able to come off and having those splines in place keeps the board from being knocked off the top.\nNow, you don't need to use mitered corners. Butting boards right next to each other at the corners and throwing some screws in will work just fine. You do need to run grooves in the wood for the .080 acrylic sheets to slide into. The depth for these cuts I made at about 3/8\". The width 3/16\" (The way I did that was by using the kerf of my blade (an 1/8\") and adding a 1/16\" second pass). Between each channel, if you choose to use multiple sheets, I left about an 1/8\".\nNot something that's absolutely necessary, but I made a small recess on the back of the frame that allowed me to insert a sheet of paneling. If you don't want to recess it, you can always lay it directly on top of the wood frame and glue it down. If you want to be able to remove the sheets of acrylic, remember that the only parts of the frame that will be glued are the sides and the bottom to the back.

In retrospect, this step was probably unnecessary since I don't think it could be seen from a distance once it was painted. I considered carving the mortar lines to add depth but decided against it because 1) the mortar of my house is pretty flush with the surface of the brick and 2) from so far away, people weren't going to be able to see it. Instead, I just relied on faux painting.\nSpackle the foam as necessary (any noticeable score marks, etc.) and apply a base coat. I used leftover off-white drywall primer but any latex or acrylic paint should work. Apply a couple of washes in brown and grey - depending on the color of the mortar you're trying to match. Irregularity is the key; you don't want an even color. I used brushes and paper towels to mottle the surface. Next, I measured the pattern and shapes of the brick that I was going to match and replicated this - as well as I could - with masking tape. Before taping, I (CAREFULLY!) cut the edges of the masking tape to, once again, make it less uniform.

Measure his or her legs from toe to heel, heel to knee, and knee to hip and use these dimensions to cut and attach the wooden structure. Add a couple of feet length to the knee to hip measurement so you have plenty of material to help you when you're ready to install the legs. I used 3/4\" thick by 1.5\" wide plywood pieces that I glued and screwed together. Cover your model's legs with plastic wrap or scrap fabric and then start wrapping them in duct tape from ankle to thigh. Once wrapped, mark hash marks along the line where you intend to cut. Carefully (no flesh wounds, please!) use scissors to cut off the duct tape along the line and then tape the legs back up using the hash marks as reference. Slide the leg tubes (eww, sounds gross) over the wooden structure and set the legs aside.\nFind a pair of boots I used army boots) and cover them with a garbage bag. Then cover the bag in black duct tape - making sure all of the bag is covered. Once done taping, cut a slit down the back of the tape (from ankle to underside of the heel) to slide the boot out. Tape up the slit then tape the boots to the tape legs. In preparation for filling the legs with spray foam, cover the ends of the legs with cardboard and seal up everything with more duct tape.\nCut a few small slits in the legs/boots (~1/2\") through which you can poke the spray foam applicator tube.

(The contact or pin which is between the coil contacts of the relay are located in such a way that it does not fit to the dot board, so I had to drill a hole at that exact spot so that all the contacts of the relay can be fixed to the board).\nI added some flux to help solder the contacts to the board. I highly recommend using flux when soldering since it helps mate the parts together. Even the generic flux would not cost much, and would still do the trick.\n2. TP4056 Charge Module with DW-01 Protector\nWe also need a TP4056 Battery Charge Circuit which has the DW-01 Battery Protector already built-in.

Without a proper discharge protection circuit, the battery will be over-discharged and will become useless.\nI will connect the Charge Controller to the Dot Board with copper wire, which makes a conductive connection while holding the Controller to the Board in place. There are six contacts in the Charge Controller, all of which should be connected to the Dot Board\n3. Fly-back Diode\nI soldered in a Diode to act as a Fly Back Diode for the Relay. A fly back diode is required when you are dealing with coils, and one is used here since a relay is mainly a coil.\n4. Terminal Connectors (Optional)\nI used terminal connectors to connect the battery and the buck converter(which is in turn connected to the pump motor) to the dot board, but you could just solder in them directly if you so wish. I used a permanent marker to mark in the polarity of the connection, so that I do not connect the battery or the buck converter in the wrong way.\nBEWARE connecting it with the wrong polarity can damage the circuit.\n5. Connecting the PCB components\nI used copper wire to complete the connections with the components.

The basic principle is that if you crochet multiple stitches into the each chain stitch, the work will naturally curl up. This is slightly complicated by the fact that longer stitches mean a bigger radius, and a bigger radius needs a correspondingly bigger circumference, or it will be more and more steeply cone-shaped rather than going relatively flat around the center. In other words, taller stitches means you need a few more of them, hence more increases near the end.\nStart by chaining 20. Then, in the second chain from the hook, work three single crochets. Do the same in each of the next two chains. In each of the next five chains after that, work three half double crochets. Then in the next chain, work three double crochets, then four double crochets in the next chain, followed by three double crochets again in the next chain. The next three chains will have the same 3-4-3 pattern, but with half treble crochets* instead of double crochets. The next four chains will be worked in treble crochet, with four in the first one, three in the second one, then four, then three.

I didn't have any furniture, let alone a tree for Christmas. So I wrapped all our moving boxes and stacked them up in a pyramid... and that was our tree that year. That sorta started a tradition. Each year since I've built our tree out of recycled or upcycled materials that I either salvage or already have on hand. I love the idea of giving stuff destined for the landfill some new life before sending them on their way.\n2018's tree is made from scrap plywood and melamine left over from our stairway remodel. I had already cut much of the sheet goods into 7\" strips for stair risers. So it was just a matter of ripping the rest of the sheets to strips, cutting them to length, and pinning them together as open boxes. From there I just stacked them on one another and hung a red LED on the inside.\nI ran out of usable wood towards the cap of the tree and had to start cobbling together tiny scraps to finish before I lost my daylight outside. I'm not terribly fond of the last course - but whatever.\nHere's some links to previous trees:\n2017's cottonball tree\n2016's magazine tree\n2015's cardboard cutout tree\n2014 and earlier trees in a gallery post (no instructions)", "title": "Upcycled Christmas Tree 2018", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Upcycled-Christmas-Tree-2018/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I really just used approximately two 4'x8'x.75\" sheets of melamine and half a sheet of 4'x8'x.68\" plywood.\nSome of it I had already ripped and trimmed to length to be used as stair risers when remodeling my hall stairs.

The Prusa had about 1mm clearance for me to work with. Since I would be adding my design halfway through, that meant my inner piece (the snowflake) could be no more than 2mm thick so I went with that (I actually did 2.1mm to get an even number of layers - it ended up being 10 layers).\nEven though the inner piece can only be 2mm, the ring could be thicker, but I decided to keep things simple and went with 2mm for the border thickness as well.

We wanted two different models for the ordinary days and a bigger model for the 24th. A house should have a facade, a base, and a little bit of place to put objects in it because, you know, it's supposed to be an Advent Calendar.\nI used Tinkercad to model the houses. It was my first time assembling a model composed of multiple 3d printed parts so my first try was naturally a failure. I managed to print a roof, a base, and a facade but assembling everything together proved to be a challenge. Furthermore, printing the roof as it was was rather risky considering the small surface resting on the printing bed. Thus I decided to add some guides to help the assembly. The guides also helped reinforce the roof.\nYou can find my first attempt here: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/dyDCwBIKtDU-advent-calendar-2018-house-1 Just don't use it for your houses!\nYou can find all the models on Tinkercad:\nmedium house: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/dQXSZ2lIcOY-adve...\nsmall house: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/j5zEGQoORGx-adve...\nbig house: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/aW20UFfQLac-advent-calendar-2018-house-3-v2\nFor decoration purpose I also printed some snowflakes using: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/3s42krccw6k-snowflake. It is basically a SVG image imported into Tinkercad. It will automatically create a 3d model that you can resize at will. I picked a free snowflake that I found with Google Image and converted it in SVG using an online tool like this one: https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-svg\nTo print them using PLA, you don't need support or even brim, just ensure the infill is at least 20% as we will sand the surfaces later. I used Slic3r to create my gcode. Once the models are tested, it is recommended to batch the prints as we will need to print 24 houses for the Advent Calendar.\nIn term of cost, the big house costed about $ 1.86 of filament and the smaller one about $ 1.28 each for a total of roughly $ 32. You will probably need two PLA spools for all the houses.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKJ/GSQ3/JOYNRRRP/FKJGSQ3JOYNRRRP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTU/0MVY/JOYNRRS2/FTU0MVYJOYNRRS2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT6/JW18/JOYNRRRL/FT6JW18JOYNRRRL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO5/H3Y7/JOYNRRRN/FO5H3Y7JOYNRRRN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8X/7ZY2/JOYNRSSB/F8X7ZY2JOYNRSSB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Creating the 3d Models"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "After assembling the houses, I found some gaps that needed to be filled. Also a raw model, just out of the 3d printer, due to how FDM printers work, has a very rugged appearance. Applying paint at this step will produce very poor results.\nRight now, what we need to do is to glue the facade, the base, and the roof together for each houses. A safe bet is to use superglue for the job. In my case, I used an old epoxy syringe. Apply some glue to the guide and put everything in place. You can use rubber bands to ensure the pieces are tightly fit together. I use my hands as clamps. I also applied some glue at the back to close some gaps. Once everything is glued, begin the hellish cycle of sanding.\nFirst, we need to sand the houses to remove glue excess, artifacts, and to smooth everything up. You can stop when the model become white-ish. I am using PLA so I need to pay extra attention to the sanding process. If I am impatient and apply to much force, I can very likely melt the plastic. Either be patient or use some water during the sanding. I started with a grit of 120.\nOnce the houses are smooth-ish, it is time to apply some fillers. This step is crucial if one want to have a very good finish. I only had filler paste so I went with it. If you can find a 2in1 filler and primer, then by all means, use this. The filler paste is very useful when the gaps we want to fill are large. As you can see on the pictures, it is my first time applying filler. The more filler you apply the more work you have afterwards. After applying the filler, I waited for 30 minutes (following the maker's instructions) before sanding the house. I started with a grit of 180 and went done to a grid of 400. I used some sanding sticks for the windows and the chimneys, they are extremely handy.\nThe result is a very smooth piece of plastic without any gaps. You can add another layer of filler and do another sanding pass to further improve the results.\nI used sanding sponges to prepare the snowflakes. I don't really care about their rugged appearance as they are supposed to be \"imperfect\".", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVT/XWHZ/JOYNRSWW/FVTXWHZJOYNRSWW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT5/WIRN/JOYNRSX1/FT5WIRNJOYNRSX1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJG/I5XZ/JOYNRSXN/FJGI5XZJOYNRSXN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9U/VYNK/JOYNRSY9/F9UVYNKJOYNRSY9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJR/9PS7/JOYNRSXO/FJR9PS7JOYNRSXO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F56/DRJU/JOYNRSYA/F56DRJUJOYNRSYA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8F/2F69/JOYNRSYC/F8F2F69JOYNRSYC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDB/W6T3/JOYNRSYB/FDBW6T3JOYNRSYB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGW/KGNJ/JOYNRSWZ/FGWKGNJJOYNRSWZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Post-processing of the Models"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Here is the fun part, painting!\nTo paint the model, I reused an old package and a piece of wood that acts as a stand.

I started with some layers of primer to ensure the paint will stick to the plastic then I sprayed many layers of acrylic paint following the instructions. The darker houses is actually dark blue or prussian blue and it reveals lot of flaws in the models especially around the junctions between the facade, the base, and the roof.\nI should have applied another layer of filler for the bigger one but I am very happy with the result. I tried to paint on a raw 3d print before and the result was just disgusting even after printing at very low resolution (0.05mm).\nI wanted to paint the houses' numbers with a gold paint using some stencils and I am quite frustrated when I see the result. The cheap stencils I found on Amazon (the only one I could find actually) produce some bleedings. The ideal would be to create our own stencils that stick to the model...

Every light bulbs are directly connected to the power supply in parallel with the help of Wago connectors.\nIt will be messy to have all the houses connected that way. You can either organize the houses in clusters or use a frame that will support all the houses and ensure everything is connected together. I will probably use the frame approach as I want to add some circuitry to only light up specific houses. You can even choose not to add lights which is perfectly fine.\nIf you want to use candles, you will need to enlarge the base to ensure the flame won't go near the roof.

It's just fun, and a challenging way to move your body in creative ways. It requires no equipment, but if you want to expand the ways you can move and introduce resistance you can use a suspension trainer, which is a system of adjustable straps, handles, and an anchor point or two to achieve new angles and ranges of motion for calisthenic movements.\nCurrently, the best suspension trainers out there come from a brand called Monkii. They're currently on their third product iteration, called the Pocket Monkii, which strips away a lot of the features of previous versions to create an ultimate portable gym.

It consists of three lengths of nylon webbing from the tie-down straps. The first is roughly one foot long, and will go through the padded door stop and be secured to the anchor end of the cam buckle. Through the adjustable end of the cam buckle will be another length of webbing, which will be a four feet in length and have a small loop sewn on the end. Through this loop will be last length of webbing, which will be about 10 feet in length. On either end of this strap is a \"Lower Triangle.\"\nLower Triangle\nThe Lower Triangle will is made by running the end of the strap through a handle, then securing the end back onto the strap. The lower triangle will be roughly 18 inches of webbing.\nSewing\nThere will be four sewn joints: One on each Lower Triangle, one to create the loop on the adjustable strap, and one to close the fasten the door stop strap together. Each sewn joint will be sewn in a \"Box X\" pattern, which is just a box with an X inside. This is a very secure stitch that will prevent any slipping or pulling apart of the webbing. Each joint (except for the door stop strap) will be secured further with a bit of heat shrink tubing. This will protect the stitching and make everything look a bit better too", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMD/YTTF/JOSY0DBQ/FMDYTTFJOSY0DBQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFV/WAYG/JOSY0DQX/FFVWAYGJOSY0DQX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Design"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Handles/Door Stop\nCut the PVC into three lengths using a hacksaw. These should be cut to just slightly longer than the width of your closed hand. For me it was about 4.5\". Two will be handles, and one will be the door stop. Use a utility knife to fillet out the inside edges of the ends of each piece; this will prevent rubbing and abrasion of the straps on those corners. Wrap the handles in a layer of Gorilla Tape. I find that Gorilla Tape works best, as it's extremely durable and offers a nice grip on the handles. Wrap a couple layers of foam tape on the door anchor, then wrap a layer of Gorilla Tape over top of that. This combination adds a good about of protection for the door and creates a friction \"bite\" on the door that will prevent any slipping while moving around and exercising.\nStraps\nMeasure out and cut your 10', 4', and 1' lengths of strap. Cut off any tags or hooks attached to the straps when you got them, you just want strap material. When you make a cut, burn the edge of the strap immediately to prevent fraying; just take a flame to the end and just make sure you see a line of melted nylon form across the edge.\nThread two handles and two pieces of heat shrink through the 10' strap, slide a piece of heat shrink on the 4' strap, and slide the \"anchor\" end of the cam buckle and the door stop through the 1' piece.\nSew\nCreate a Lower Triangle on one end of the 10' strap by setting a handle approximately six inches from the end of the strap, then bringing the strap end to the rest of the strap about six inches above the other end of the handle (see picture) Secure the strap end to the other side of the strap with a Box X stitch. Create a Lower triangle on the other end of the 10' strap in the same way\nCreate a small loop (about 3 inches in diameter) on one end of the 4' strap. Secure this loop with another Box X stitch. The other end of this strap will feed through the cam buckle (see picture)\nOn the 1' strap with the cam buckle and door stop, simply sew the ends of the strap together with another Box X stitch to close the loop. When complete, slide the stitched joint into the body of the door stop to hide it.\nShrink\nSlide a piece of heat shrink over the stitches on the Lower Triangles and small loop. Shrink it down by applying even heat with a heat gun or lighter/torch from a distance. Be careful not to burn yourself or damage the straps or stitches.\nYou should now have three separate pieces:\nThe 10' strap with a Lower Triangle on either end\nThe 4' strap with a loop on the end\nThe 1' strap with the door stop and cam buckle", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTO/3CNP/JOSY0DJ2/FTO3CNPJOSY0DJ2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7P/OJ3V/JOSY0E9T/F7POJ3VJOSY0E9T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2G/OT2Z/JOSY0DA0/F2GOT2ZJOSY0DA0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAK/F00H/JOSY0D80/FAKF00HJOSY0D80.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNK/NK3R/JOSY0D74/FNKNK3RJOSY0D74.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Process - Cut, Sew, Shrink"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Assembly\nFeed the 4' strap end (without the loop) through the back of the cam of the cam buckle, and pull the end through to your desired length.

You won't have to wind the straps or disassemble anything; the whole thing can be stuffed into the case of your choosing. I chose to go with a toiletry/Dopp bag, as it just fits with the travel theme of this system. You can use something like a pencil case or Nalgene bottle, or just fold the straps up and wrap an elastic around the handles or something, you can't really go wrong here.\nDoor Setup\nIMPORTANT: Make sure you are setting up on a door that opens away from you, in this way the force you apply on the Pocket Monkii will be pulling the door into the door jamb, and not into the open position.\nSimply open the door, place the door stop at the top of the door on the side opposite from you, then close the door (see picture).

Convenience is key! Cut away the broken bits, and replace it with cork!\nThis Instructable was prepared as a project for the Fall 2018 offering of INTEG 375: Hands-on Sustainability, a third-year course in the Knowledge Integration program at the University of Waterloo. The whole point of the course was to reclaim an item out of the waste stream that could be repaired and repurposed. We had found this broken mirror and decided this would be our project, we wanted to transform this broken mirror and give it a new life and purpose. We decided that by adding a little cork the mirror could be used in a front hallway as an organizational tool. After completing our Instructable, the mirror ended up in our home by the front door and has been utilized by all roommates, especially has a reminder for things like bills, or when home supplies were needed.\nOverall this experience provided us with the opportunity to use our hands and through that we were able to pick up several handy skills. From glass cutting, panting, and applying spackle, the process of repairing our mirror has opened our eyes to the possibilities of repair and waste reclamation. One thing, in particular, we learned from this experience was that people waste a lot of money buying new things when they can be easily fixed. A simple repair job like our mirror has transformed a broken oval-shaped mirror into a useful item that serves two purposes: the first as a mirror and the second as a cork board.\nWe hope our experience inspires viewers to reclaim their broken items!", "title": "Mirror With Cork", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Mirror-With-Cork/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "These are the materials you will need:\nGlass Cutter\nWood\nGlue\nPutty (spackle)\nPutty knife\nExacto knife\nPaper towel\nScissors\nPaper\nPencil Marker\nSandpaper\nPaint\nScrews\nPicture Hanging Wire", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSH/CUC9/JOEW65K9/FSHCUC9JOEW65K9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: List of Materials"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Remove glass from the mirror, and observe the breaks and cracks.

We had a crescent-shaped crack in our mirror when it was found it, and it was an oval shaped mirror to start with. We decided to cut a large piece of paper into the shape of the mirror (to replicate the original shape pre-break) so that we could fold the paper to find an even line to cut across. Using a ruler, draw the line across the mirror, to prepare for scoring.\nb) Score the Glass\nNow that a line is drawn across the mirror, you can score the glass to make a clean break. Be extra careful with the glass you are planning to preserve(we'd recommend you put on some gloves and goggles for this part). Using your glass cutter and a ruler, guide the glass cutter along your drawn line and really put your weight into the cutter. With practice, you\u2019ll find there is a difference between scraping the surface and getting a deeper score of the glass. You should try to get close to the edges of the glass you\u2019re cutting, but avoid running the blade off the edge because you\u2019ll leave cracks along it.\nc) Make a Clean Break\nOnce you\u2019ve gotten a clean score along your drawn line, you should be able to make a clean break. A nice quick snap of the glass will provide you with a clean break, to do this place one hand on either side of the glass and apply pressure with your thumbs on either side to break along the scored line. Doing this should provide a clean break along the score line with little resistance from the glass.\n*We suggest practice scoring on the broken end of the glass, but still leave enough room for you to properly cut your mirror.\nWith larger mirrors, it may be safer to keep the pretty bits of glass on a flat surface (like a table) and slide it until the score line is just over the (table\u2019s) edge. Have a friend hold the glass on the table while you pull down on the broken half to cleanly break along the score line.\nd) Repeat\nRepeat until you are left with the bits you want to put back in your mirror frame. Now you should have two pieces of glass, so you have preserved the part with clean breaks and your excess glass with ugly cracks. (don\u2019t throw the cracked glass away yet! We can still use it.) If there are still some cracks in the glass you\u2019d like to keep, you can consider repeating the earlier steps to cut away mirror until only the best parts are left (still, keep the leftovers because you can make fun art with them!).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJU/FHSJ/JOEW63MX/FJUFHSJJOEW63MX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJX/K4DU/JOEW66B1/FJXK4DUJOEW66B1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F50/GS5P/JOEW66QD/F50GS5PJOEW66QD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHE/7VIF/JOEW66QL/FHE7VIFJOEW66QL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F58/NJTI/JOEW64AB/F58NJTIJOEW64AB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Cut the Mirror!"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Now we get to fill the remaining space in the frame with corkboard.

The lower the light, the slower the growth rate. What I\u2019ve found is that different Hoyas grow at slightly different rates. My Hoya carnosa variegata grows faster than my Hoya obovata.\nTemperature:\nIf your home is comfortable for you, it\u2019ll be so for your houseplants too. Just be sure to keep your Hoyas away from any cold drafts as well as air conditioning or heating vents.\nHumidity:\nHoyas are native to the tropics. Despite this, I\u2019ve found them to be adaptable & do just fine in our homes which tend to have dry air. Here in hot dry Tucson mine are doing great.

Hoyas like to grow a bit potbound so don\u2019t rush to repot yours if it\u2019s dong fine.\nRegarding transplanting & repotting, don\u2019t think your Hoya will need it every year. Like orchidsthey\u2019ll bloom better if slightly tight in their pots so leave them be for a few years. I hadn\u2019t repotted my large variegated Hoya for 3 years & did it because the soil was way down in the pot.\nPruning:\nYou can prune a Hoya to control the size, make it more bushy, to thin it out or remove any dead growth. I don\u2019t prune off too many of short stalks from which the flowers emerge because hard bloom on new growth. In other words, a hard pruning which is sometimes necessary will delay the flowering process.\nPropagation:\nHere\u2019s an entire post on propagating Hoyas so click on for all the details. The condensed version here: I\u2019ve had great success with 2 of methods \u2013 propagating by stem cuttings in water & layering. For layering you simply take a softwood stem of the plant (which is still attached to the mother) & pin it into a pot filled with light mix. Make sure the mix is thoroughly moistened. Most times you\u2019ll see little roots appearing on the stems and that\u2019s what you want to get on top of the mix.\nPests:\nWhen grown indoor Hoyas can be susceptible to mealybugs. These white, cotton-like pests like to hang out in the nodes & under the leaves. Also keep your eye out for scale & aphids. It\u2019s best to take action as soon as you see any pest because multiply like crazy.\nToxicity:\nRing the bells! Hoyas are one of the non-toxic houseplants. Just know that if your pet or child chews on the leaves or stems, it could make them sick.\nFlowers:\nSaving the best for last \u2013 Hoya flowers are beautiful! Their waxy, star-like blooms are intriguing & can be found in many colors, sizes & forms depending on the species of Hoya.\nSome bloom in the first year & others take a few years to establish before they bloom. My Hoya carnosa \u201cvariegata\u201d took almost 3 years to bloom by the way, so be patient. And, it doesn\u2019t bloom every year. I say Hoyas bloom when they feel like it! How often they bloom seems to depend on the type of hoya, age of the hoya, conditions they\u2019re growing in.\nAnd, don\u2019t cut the old flowers off; let them remain on the plant. The wonderful flowers are fragrant too, especially in the evening. The icing on the floral cake! Indoors they take longer to bloom, depending on the species.\nIf yours is indoors & has never bloomed, it\u2019s most likely not getting enough light.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYK/DU1Y/JOHOPQHX/FYKDU1YJOHOPQHX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Repotting/Transplanting a Hoya Plant:"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "As houseplants, Hoyas bloom when it\u2019s warm & prefers cooler temps in the winter months to set buds.\nThey\u2019re also more likely to bloom when tight in their pots.\nDon\u2019t prune off the fresh side growth because that\u2019s where the flowers form.\nGive your Hoya a shower every now & then. It keeps the gorgeous foliage clean & dust & dirt free. Besides, it\u2019ll temporary up the ante on the humidity factor.\nPeople have asked me about yellow leaves on Hoyas. My Variegated Hoya occasionally gets yellow leaves because it\u2019s about 6 years old now, grows very full & that\u2019s what happens as they age. If the leaves are yellow & a bit mushy, then you\u2019re overwatering. It could also be due to a nitrogen deficiency.\nI hope these tips have helped you out. If you\u2019re a beginning houseplant gardener be sure to give 1 of the Hoyas a try. Just remember, no pampering and no overwatering.

I\u2019m all for recycling but the bottles piling up in my room had to go. What if you could just get rid of your bottles and cans without leaving the house or going to the garage or basement? The solution is ConRec. While my motivation to build this project might be laziness, the device can also provide a much more important service to those who can\u2019t leave their homes because of medical reasons. You open a latch that fits in a first-floor window, slide your bottles and cans down the chute and they go right into a recycle container. The container has a battery powered air freshener, a wifi camera to monitor when the barrel is full on your smartphone and it even has a handle that can \u201cjiggle\u201d the barrel to settle and even out the cans. The product also goes a long way toward promoting and encouraging recycling.\nTime Needed:\nThe project took about 12-14 hours to put together (It\u2019ll probably be a lot quicker now that I\u2019ve done it once.) and about 10-15 minutes for final installation in the window. There were a bunch of measurements to take for the wood components, and locations of pilot holes and screws. There were things like the door latch that needed to be changed (did not originally plan on using a bungie cord), figuring out a way to attach the air freshener to the inside of the barrel, and getting the wi-fi camera to work took up a lot of time.\nCost:\nIt costs about $130 to make. The biggest expense was a $60.00 one-inch camera. The wood cost 23.00, the barrel cost $10.00, the air freshener cost $10.00, paint $7.00 and the hardware (screws, hinges, dryer chute, L brackets) added up to 22.00. It may seem expensive but the convenience and service it provides is worth it.\nProject Difficulty:\nYou should be comfortable using a drill and jigsaw.

You'll want the hutch dust and crust free for the best adhesion and smoothest paint job. When it's clean, put painters tape on the areas you don't want paint on.\n2nd- Prime the hutch! Just follow the direction on your primer and prime away. You won't need to prime if using chalk paint. I love chalk paint, but it has a feel to it when it dries. I suggest Annie Sloan. It gets pricey, but it's well worth it.\n3rd- It's Optional, but I like painting a base coat. This is the first layer of paint intended for the application of the color. Base coats also tend to operate as the base of the color scheme, where other layers of more transparent or colored paints can be then coated on smoothly. We used white milk paint.\n4th- Paint your hutch! We used a wine colored milk paint on the outside and Khaki colored paint on the inside. It took three coats to paint this thing. What's milk paint you ask? Milk paint is made from skim milk, lime, or just casein and pigment. (Our paint has casein). Milk paint is not harmful to the environment and the materials used are natural so there are no harmful fumes. It's pretty awesome stuff!\n5th-You'll use the top coat to protect the new paint job. There is a massive selection available too with options like polyurethane or epoxy.\n6th-It's optional, but we antiqued the hutch with an antiquing liquid. The brand we used goes over the top coat You can also use a tinted wax like Briwax or Annie Sloan dark wax. You won't need the top coat if you use a wax.\nFabric on the shelves! We found a whole bunch of this granny fabric on sale (I'm all about this kind of fabric) and we used some of it on the shelves. Just staple fabric to the shelves with a staple gun.

Be careful with electrical work!\n-Short circuits. This is when a live wire touches a neutral. This will usually make a fuse blow, but if that doesn't happen, the connection will get hot and then melt and then possibly cause a fire.\n-Overloads. If the flow of current exceeds the wires specs, the internal wire heats up. This could cause the connection to melt and cause a fire.\nInfo on the things I used:\nJunction box:Whenever you splice wires together you should enclose the connections in a junction box. This is a safety measure that prevents fires that can occur if the wires overheat and also protects people from getting shocked by live wires.\nClosed end crimp connectors: Closed end connectors are crimp-able for a quick, inexpensive, easy and permanent electrical connection of two or more wires. You can seal up the connector using dual wall heat shrink with adhesive, or you can wrap it with standard electrical tape. I wrapped these in electrical tape. The maximum voltage rating for closed end connectors is 300 volts. For single/small boxes, push in connectors are easier to use.\nNylon wire clamps: Clamps are specially designed to hold cables, tubes and components and allow you to easily mount bundles of cables to walls, ceilings or any other surface. The clamp has quite an easy application, simply screw the clamp to surface. Single/small boxes do not require clamps inside, but the wires must be stapled within 8in/20cm of the box.\nYou don't need to ground plastic boxes, since they are made of a non conductive material.

Too lightweight, too many voids, too unstable. Given a week or two of use, and it'd be terrible.\nSo we need to stablise is. We use a resin called cactus juice. It's a heat hardening resin, that's pretty thin.

Sand the edges of the pipes if they are rough using the sand paper.

But make sure that the orientation of the T joint is kept vertical. Refer to the step 3 of the illustration (attached image) of the joinery.\nStep 4: In this step, we will assemble the leg of the stand.

Refer to the step 4 of the illustration (attached image) of the joinery.\nRepeat step 4 to make another leg of the stand.\nNext, we will attach these legs to the stand.

Sand the rough/sharp edges using the sand paper.\nStep 2: Twist the cotton cloth to make 6 inches long wicks which will be used to draw water from the pipe into the planter thus keeping the soil moist/wet.\nStep 3: Using a pointed tool or a poker screwdriver, mount a hole at the center of the bottle cap. I heated up the pointed tool and made a hole. This was way easier than drilling a hole using a drilling machine.\nNote: Create the hole big enough to pass the cotton wick through it easily.\nStep 4: Thread the twisted cotton cloth into the bottle caps.

Then we render everything at the end.\nChange the height:\nAt default the height is 120mm (4.7 inches). You can change this number by altering\ncylinder_height = 120;\nto a higher number. Be reasonable, 5 inches is what most retail bed risers are at. However, there is no limit to the height you can print.

These are arbitrary values, although if you want to raise your bed higher, you probably want to increase the base radius. As this is a \"radius\" of what is essentially a square shaped cylinder, understand that double the radius will be the length of each side of the base or top of the bed riser.

in the US).  You see them in all the garden stores around the holidays because they're one of the few show-stopping plants that bloom in Nov-Dec and which grow easily indoors.  Unfortunately, many are mislabeled, and most are actually Thanksgiving Cactus (Schlumbergera truncata) rather than Christmas Cactus (Schlumbergera x buckleyi; How to Tell the Difference).  However, you can pick them up after Christmas for nickels and dimes and propagate them till your house is covered in them.  Three segments is enough to start a whole new plant which makes them an excellent candidate for doing a large planting VERY inexpensively.\n\nLast year I picked up more than a dozen pots of Thanksgiving Cactus for about $7 which was outrageously cheap.  I grew them all year giving them as much outside time as possible, so they were outside from roughly April till early November here in Central Texas. \n\nSchlumbergera are epiphytic cacti and thrive in shade, humidity, and quick-draining soil.  Wait, what?  Humidity and quick-draining soil?  Despite what some sources say, they do not like water-retaining soils, and I have the rotten plants to show for it.  They are in the Cactaceae family after all.  They come from tropical jungles and grow in the trees much like epiphytic orchids, and also like orchids, they like a coarse \"soil\" and humidity.  Their roots will rot easily if you give them a potting soil rich in compost and peat moss. \n\nTowards the middle of October, my Thanksgiving Cacti started to bud as the daylight hours shortened and my watering regime lessened.  I submitted this particular planting to a garden show competition and got a Green Thumb (the equivalent of an A+).  I might have taken a \"Best of\" had it been fully in bloom rather than just budding.  Of course, it started blooming a week after the show, and they've been blooming and setting new buds ever since.  For the rest of the year, they look like a pretty green lawn of non-threatening cacti which is very attractive in my opinion.\n\nThis Instructable shows how to mix an organic cactus potting soil, repot a Thanksgiving/Christmas Cactus, take advantage of after-Christmas plant sales, and prepare an extravagant planting for next year.  I'm doing this on a smaller scale as I already have a huge planting and have spent the past year experimenting with the plants.  However, once you know how to prep the pot, mix the potting soil, and separate the plants, you can easily create a huge planting of them.  Like most inexpensive, DIY gardening projects, you have to wait to reap the benefits, but you will have something spectacular in the end.  I worked on a single planting for a year, and I don't regret it.  I have other plantings that will take decades.  Consider this \"quick\" when it comes to plants and gardening in general.\n\nNote:  I say \"cacti\" rather than \"cactuses\" out of personal preference.  Spelling nazis can argue the finer points of which is correct.\n\nNote:  I am using plants in this Instructable that are budding/blooming which is something you do not want to do.  The blooms and buds are very sensitive to movement and will drop off easily.  Wait until the plants are done blooming before repotting so you can enjoy them for as long as they last - there will be plenty of time to see them without the blooms/buds.\n\nNote:  As with many gardening how-to's, there's going to be disagreement.  Many gardeners, including myself, are reluctant to be explicit in how to care for plants because it's more art than science, but if it weren't for gardeners willing to be explicit, I never would have tried because it would have required too much mysterious gardening voodoo.  In the end, you're going to develop a sense of how to best care for a plant by feeling it out and trying lots of different things, and depending on how you garden, you might have to adjust some of the things I suggest.", "title": "Grow a \"Lawn\" of Truncata for the Holidays (and the Rest of the Year)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Grow-a-Lawn-of-Truncata/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Materials:\n1 Part Builder Sand\n1 Part Pea Gravel or Perlite\n1-2 Parts Compost (preferably your own)\n\nTake a container (tin can in my case) and fill with sand.

Someone gave me this heat gun before a move, and I was happy to have it, but I've done similar plastic work with other heat sources.

It's much easier to add more heat if you need it, but hard to fix if you add too much.\nTurning a right hand into a left hand was going to be the most work, so I started with that process, testing how the plastic responded to the heat as I warmed the pinky end joint.\nI was afraid of a cave-in that would require extra surgery, so I worked pretty slowly. The plastic was forgiving, and I was happy with how it worked. A few times I felt things getting too soft, so I quickly backed off and blew on the hot spots.\nWork the front, back, and sides of the joint you want to move, avoiding overheating the bones themselves unless you want bend them a bit also.\nMove around the whole hand, making small adjustments all over first, before going back and getting a final pose.\n-----\nAlternate Heat Sources:\nIf you don't have a heat gun you could try:\nHair dryer (it might take a while to get hot enough)\nOven or toaster oven (you'll have to be careful about the plastic slumping and deforming under its own weight, and you'll want to start at a low temperature to avoid overdoing it and ending up with a puddle or a fire)\nHot water (keep tongs and gloves handy, also, hot water might get inside the hollow plastic and behave unpredictably)\nCandle or lighter (you will probably burn your fingers, you will release toxic fumes, and you might light the plastic on fire, so I only recommend trying these if you understand how to do so safely, and take appropriate precautions)\nThis is a good time to repeat the safety warning.\nWarning!

There is no need to mess with it. Leave it alone!\nTo confirm which pin is the trigger pin on your machine. First consult the image here. Then warm up your machine and short this pin to the middle ground pin with a bit of spare wire. Make sure you are holding the wire by its insulation to avoid shock. When you ground the trigger pin the machine should begin to pump smoke. If you ground the wrong pin (power) you will probably get a spark and the machine will not smoke. Dont worry this quick test will not hurt the machine or you (if you are only touching the insulation on your test wire).\nNow that we know which are the trigger and the ground pins all we need to do is create a custom cord so we can connect it to the Relay Module.\nMake a cord using some 18 gauge wire and the IEC-320 C14 Male Power Connector at whatever length is appropriate for your application.\nThe other end of this cord will be connected to the Relay Module.

The other end was then pulled through the opposite eye screw and held tight with pliers while the end knot was tied. I can hold the rope way easier with pliers and not have it slip than just finger tight. Once a section was tied, a zip tie was placed on each knot to keep them in place and from loosening up.\nThe second rope tied was the top to the bottom. This was tied at one end, wrapped around the center string once, and tied pulled tight at the other. This creates a wrapped cross in the center.\nA corner string is then tied from one corner to the other without wrapping the center. This helps to center your two already wrapped ropes under it.

And then I ended up with about 300 feet of extra rope. But hey, I had enough 79 foot pieces to complete all 75 panels.\nEach piece was tightly wrapped around a holder. I used cut down paint stirrers, some cardboard tubes that used to hold essential oils my wife ordered, and even a block of wood. Whatever you have works, just wrap them tight.When you wrap them how you thought was tight, they unravel and mess everything up and you wrap them again tighter mumbling under your breath the whole time.\nThen you start in the center and tie approximately 72 knots, all the same, just a simple clove hitch. Each time you pull the knot tight and when you get done you have a web. 79 feet actually works out pretty well for spacing of the webs. It is almost as if I trialed a piece before I bought 8000 feet so I knew how much I really needed. Or maybe I laid it out after the fact and got really lucky that I didn't just get 7000 like I planned. Likely the latter of the two.\nYou will find that the webs are now adjustable. If one is a bit loose just slide the knot. That is fun until some kid comes up and messes with it and you have a ton to readjust. So I glued them, all of them, with white all purpose Elmers glue and a paint brush. Now they will all stay in place, until it rains, and you find out Elmer's all purpose glue is water soluble, even though it doesn't say it is. Then you get a half a gallon of white glue that runs off the webs during the rain, and gets on your clothes as you set up.

I used 2 tap cons per piece, or 150 overall burning through 4 bits which are completely dull now.\nWhen I drew out the final layout of the maze, it took 79 panels. I had made 75. So I used some straw bales on corners as fill in panels to create the whole thing square. Some rebar in the bales secured them upright. We made it look like it should have been there, adding pumpkins, spiders, and webs.\nThe maze ended up 32x32.

I\u2019ve found that heat stress shows up faster on a plant that does sunburn. Stronger, better-adapted plants will recover at the end of the day.\nThis is true of my lantana which wilts in the day & perks back up in the evening. For the majority cases, sunburn is superficial & cosmetic only. The plant recovers although it may happen again if you can\u2019t move the plant or provide shade.\nSunburn is more likely to kill plant which is young or has soft stems & leaves. In the latter case, tomatoes are subject to sunburn. Wait to prune until the heat of the intense sun & heat of the season is over. You might have the urge to prune it right away but that can lead to more sunburn further in. I found that the dead leaves hanging on the outer stems can provide some shade for the inner stems.\nGive your plant a little extra boost with compost. It also helps to hold the moisture in around the base of the plant. Water deeply but not too often. The plant is stressed; you don\u2019t want to flood it every day. You can water all you want but it won\u2019t prevent the plant from sun burning or heat stressing.\nMy Star Jasmine is on drip & I deep water it with the hose once a month in the warmer months. Doesn\u2019t stop the burn & heat stress. Start small; you can always go back & take out more. The stems of my Star Jasmine were dead only at the ends so I started light. I usually go back in a week or so & do a little tweaking if needed.\nHaving said all of this, I believe in the right plants for the right environment. I don\u2019t think Tucson will get any cooler or any wetter. Star Jasmine needs at least 1 pruning during the season which isn\u2019t a bother for me at all. What I\u2019m on the fence about is using water for a plant which isn\u2019t optimum for this climate and has dead, somewhat peaked and limp leaves on it for 4 months out of the year.\n\nThe verdict isn\u2019t quite out yet as to whether I\u2019ll keep this plant out or not. I love the sweetly scented flowers in the late winter/spring but don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth it.

Here\u2019s how I use worm compost and compost for houseplants in my indoor and outdoor gardens.\nHere\u2019s my reasoning for nourishing my houseplants with this dynamic duo: this is how these plants get fed when growing in their natural environments. Many houseplants are native to sub-tropical and tropical environments and get their nourishment from plant matter falling from above. Compost is basically decomposed organic matter. And of course, earthworms also inhabit these areas and aerate and enrich the soil.\nWhen talking about worm compost, I\u2019m not referring to vermiculture and raising my own earthworms. I buy the worm compost (organic of course) in a bag from a local garden center. My houseplants seem to love it and are healthy and happy. The only houseplants I don\u2019t use it for are my Lucky Bamboo and Lotus Bamboo which grow in water.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FK2/5LK8/JNULFELZ/FK25LK8JNULFELZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Why Not Feed Houseplants the Same Way?"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I have been applying them both once a year in spring. Next year I\u2019m going to start doing an application in late February/early March (I\u2019m in Tucson where the weather warms early) & then again in July.\nHow I apply the compost:\nIt depends on the size of the pot & plant. With 6\u2033 & 8\u2033 plants I apply a 1/4 \u2013 1/2\u2033 layer of worm compost & top that with a 1/2\u2033 layer of compost. Easy does it \u2013 compost can burn houseplants if you apply too much. Floor plants get more depending on their size. For instance, my 5\u2032 Schefflera amate in a 10\u2033 grow pot got an inch layer of both worm compost & compost. Just water in & let the goodness begin!\nCommon questions regarding compost for houseplants:\nDo worm compost & compost smell when applied indoors?\nNo. I buy both of them in a bag so there\u2019s no odor. If I used them fresh out of bins in the backyard, there would be a smell. Even that should dissipate over time.\nCan I use compost as potting soil?\nNo, you can\u2019t. I always mix it in when repotting or transplanting & as a topdressing but it\u2019s too strong to use as a straight mix.\nWill worms hatch out of the soil if I apply worm compost?\nNo, don\u2019t worry. Your home won\u2019t be crawling with worms.\nHow do worm compost & compost work?\nBoth start to break down quickly but the effects are long-lasting. The roots are the foundation of your houseplants & both of these amendments help make the roots stronger & well nourished. This results in healthier houseplants.\nWill my houseplants grow faster?\nHonestly, I\u2019m not sure how to answer this. My houseplants grow fairly fast because I live in a warmer, sunnier climate.\nAre pets attracted to either worm compost or compost?\nMy kitties have no interest in either one of these. If your pet(s) is prone to digging in the soil of your houseplants, you might want to look for another way to feed them.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRA/FOED/JNULFELI/FRAFOEDJNULFELI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: When I Apply Worm Compost & Compost:"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I buy both my worm compost & compost (both are organic) at local garden centers.

My outdoor container plants get nourished with this combo and have for a long time. I use a greater ratio outdoors like 1\u2033 of worm compost and 2-4\u2033 of compost.

So this is my first big project and to build this I took 26 days to make. The whole build is made out of a half inch and three-quarter inch thick ply with laminate onto it. it is always a time-consuming build whenever I am going to use laminates in my builds. In our country, people usually use laminates over other finishes as it is more durable and have a long life. Change the surface of the laminate is impermeable so the effect of moisture in the environment didn't create any trouble in the build. Initially, I wanted to create a doll dresses with the mirror in front of it so that person can see himself completely while dressing up but since I already build the concrete shelf in that area that's why that design is not going to be made. The one major problem came in this build is that none of the shelves is perfectly straight. To bring all of the shelves in the same line I have to trim of one of the shelf tiny bit so that all of them came in alignment. Other than that the whole project is very enjoyable and I learnt a lot from this build which definitely going to help me with my upcoming builds.

Once the cleanup process has been finished I started taking the dimensions from all the sides. If there are no shelves then there should be no need to do this step. Since my case is slightly different that's why I need to do that to figure out what amount of dimensions I need for my build. Here I took multiple dimensions from six sides in one shelf and then find out the mean of all of them and the mean height I get I took \u00bc\u201d less and then proceed with that height in the entire shelf. Same procedure has been followed by the depth of the cabinet.

Although you can use paint for the appearance or you can use laminate like what I use in my build. It's very durable than any other finish and very cost effective as compared to paint because of the surface hardness. The sheet cost me around 5$ and around 750 gm of wood glue used per sheet. The quantity of glue remains the same for any other kind of 8x4 sheet. So usually when you are going to purchase the laminates they provide you in rolls and if you are going to keep them for at least a day that curls remain in the sheet and if you are going to glue that onto the ply it creates a lot of problems and guarantee that you struggle in that and ended up with the air bubbles underneath the sheet. So the trick is that whenever your purchases sheet try no to use them immediately. Try to give them rest by opening them and placed them on a flat surface and also try to place another sheet of heavy ply over that. By doing this you are able to remove the stress from the sheets which are developing due to that folding. Bring them straight is very difficult as they are brittle and during transportation, there are always chance to damage them. So avoid that. To apply the sheet is tricky but not difficult. There are two kinds of adhesive you can use to paste the laminate on to the plywood. The first thing is the contact cement which is specially made for the laminates. If you don't want to use that because it smells very bad you can use regular wood glue. In all of my laminate bills are usually use the wood glue over contact cement. Although it did not give instant bonding but if you keep yourself careful then you can do it without any trouble and able to avoid air trapping underneath the laminate and that will always lead to the breaking of the laminate. So once you apply glue over the entire surface you are ready for phase 2 which is pasting the sheet over the ply. So there are two ways you can paste that. It's always good to have someone with you as its ease the process if you don't have anyone to help then roll the sheet over your head. It's quite difficult to explain you in the written text I suggest you follow the images and the video to know what I mean to roll the sheet over your head. Then align it with the two corners of the ply or the surface onto which you are going to paste the laminate sheet. Then slowly rolls it over the ply and try to press down in a unidirectional way so that if there are chances of air trapped underneath the laminate it can escape out. Then just slowly lowered it down and repeat the same procedure as done earlier. Once the pasting completed try to press the sheet for at least 10-15 minutes to remove any air underneath the laminate sheet. I do for at least 20-30 minutes in my case but I think I have overdone it and it's really not necessary. Just tried to look it at an angle to see any bubble formation. The advantage of wood glue is that if any bubble formation occurs then you have time to lift the sheet and then remove the year and then follow the pressing procedure to paste the laminate. On the other hand, if you are using contact cement and repeat the same procedure and if the bubble trapped underneath the laminate it's impossible to undo that mistake. Although there are some videos in which people are showing the method of glueing the laminate by using wooden dowels method and you can find them easily onto the YouTube. A famous inventor named Izzy sawn have a video onto his channel showing the procedure of how to glue laminate using contact cement. You must check him as well. The half inch laminates are the only one on to which I paste the laminate onto one side only because the side facing to the slabs are not going to be visible so that's why I try to avoid them.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FH6/PP8I/JNOVKKFM/FH6PP8IJNOVKKFM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3Z/2IL0/JNOVKKFY/F3Z2IL0JNOVKKFY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7N/HM86/JNOVKKH4/F7NHM86JNOVKKH4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN1/L0AR/JNOVKKHD/FN1L0ARJNOVKKHD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA8/HLXQ/JNOVKKFZ/FA8HLXQJNOVKKFZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOT/1HN1/JNOVKKG8/FOT1HN1JNOVKKG8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Gluing the Laminate"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "To make right angle jig its every necessary to make some sorts of jigs.

To provide extra strength to the right angle I provide a supportive brace in between that angle. Because the way I am going to use these jigs that middle brave going to place an important role in the joining process. I took my time to make these jigs. There is a bunch of ways you can make these jigs. I also saw some people using plywood cut-out right angle piece to make perfect joints and those are made up with CNC.

Since the project was too big so that's why instead of going for all of the pieces at once I go one by one. First I cut down the material for the bottom shelf and then move onto the upper shelves. The bottom are is going to be the drawer section of the whole build and the upper ones are going to be the cabinet area. To cut down the longer pieces are used my straight cutting jig and cut it with the help of circular saw. The three quarter inch thick plywood has been cut by same method and then trim down to final finish onto the table saw. So in those drawer sections, the ply I am using didn't have laminate on to it because in the end, they are not going to be visible. To cut the material I use my circular saw with the straight cutting jig. According to the dimensions I get from my previous calculations I use them to cut down the material for my bottom drawer section. The three quarter inch thick plywood has been cut by same method and then trim down to final finish onto the table saw. The overall length of the ply I am using in this build is 8 feet long and the width of the room are the area where I am going to made the wardrobe having width near about 10 feet. So to complete the overall length the rest of the box is going to be partially made and in that box one side is not present because I am going to attach that section to the main section with the help of l brackets. I use l brackets earlier in a lot of my previous build and the computer desk I made few years back completely made by using these brackets and they are strong enough to provide the enormous strength to the joints. The depth of the cross section is kept around 23 inches. To join those vertical section to the main horizontal section I made jig which is going to kept my vertical member in square position so that I can fasten them together. The second shelf is almost similar to the first one and only difference is that it has laminate pasted on all the visible sides. Since these are the cabinet the back portion going to be visible, I attached the back piece onto it. In the lower portion I am quite worried about the strength of the boxes but once all of the vertical pieces interconnected they formed a strong rigid structure which can easily withstand itself. In second shelf to join the remaining portion of the I use same l brackets for that. The third shelf is quite different then its remaining two siblings as it have showcase area in it where I am going to place some sort of handicrafts. The total width of this display area is around 4 ft. And I am not going to make it too deep as it's quite difficult to show those handicrafts when they are going to place at too much distance. So I reserved these area nearby 11\u201d. To me this much distance is sufficient for the display cabinet. The fourth one is way much different then rest of them as it was made in different sizes. The two longer units are 4 ft wide placed on either sides of the wall and the smaller one having dimensions 2ft is placed in the center. The main reason behind making these shelf in smaller size is because of the weight and the difficulty to lift heavy weight and place it at that much height. This might definitely causes major injury. So I tried to avoid that and go with smaller design of the cabinets. Initially I don't wanted to install the vertical section in the middle of the 4 ft wide cabinet, but since I am using \u00bd\u201d ply and it have a too much bend because of the laminate pasted to its one side. And that's the drawback of the laminate, although I don't know as it's happens to the contact cement because when wood glue dries it tried to shrink a bit and that shrinkage cause this warpage. So I remove it by inserting a vertical member in between them.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0L/25EK/JNOVKLVY/F0L25EKJNOVKLVY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQJ/974O/JNOVKLWI/FQJ974OJNOVKLWI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGL/PE3I/JNOVKLWV/FGLPE3IJNOVKLWV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2N/J38S/JNOVKLXF/F2NJ38SJNOVKLXF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3A/TWOR/JNOVKLXG/F3ATWORJNOVKLXG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7P/NPBI/JNOVKLXS/F7PNPBIJNOVKLXS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLQ/RTG5/JNOVKLY6/FLQRTG5JNOVKLY6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2T/WKF0/JNOVKLYL/F2TWKF0JNOVKLYL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUW/U4Y8/JNOVKLYX/FUWU4Y8JNOVKLYX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSQ/F6FC/JNOVKLZ9/FSQF6FCJNOVKLZ9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTF/GB17/JNOVKLZN/FTFGB17JNOVKLZN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGY/U4N8/JNOVKLZZ/FGYU4N8JNOVKLZZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLI/USAI/JNOVKM0B/FLIUSAIJNOVKM0B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZQ/TSM2/JNOVKM0N/FZQTSM2JNOVKM0N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8A/MQE5/JNOVKM0Z/F8AMQE5JNOVKM0Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI5/FOC6/JNOVKM1B/FI5FOC6JNOVKM1B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLF/ECBG/JNOVKM1N/FLFECBGJNOVKM1N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F18/8YFL/JNOVKM2W/F188YFLJNOVKM2W.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif"], "step_title": "Step 5: Material Cutting and Making Boxes"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "The display unit is the main heart of this whole build as it lies in the centre of this whole build.

Second I wanted to make it look thicker so that's why I placed a spacer in between those ply pieces and because of that, the overall thickness increases up to 1.5\u201d which is sufficient for what I need for this build. Another advantage of this is that in that case, I am able to feed the wire through them without any trouble. In the display unit for the vertical section I am using \u00be\u201d ply for the distribution and onto these sections, I didn't paste the laminate because to mount the shelf I need to drive the screw from the opposite side and that if I do so those screws going to be visible onto the laminate. To provide the mounting surface to the shelves I screwed guides to the sides and those guides are used to hold the shelf units. The image clears more. Before installing the shelf into that area I paste the laminate and drill the hole to feed the wires and then fixed the led lights to it.

Luckily all of them have one common mistake that I need to correct and that is going to be done with the help of wedges. I made them on my own. There is no rocket science in them. I just cut them at 15\u00b0 so that they gave me enough height to correct that alignment. I placed all of those wedges under all of the vertical member and them measure it with the help of spirit level. The point at which I get it levelled and aligned with the upper cabinets, at that point I stop and then repeat the procedure with the upper cabinet as well. Although you need wooden wedges since I don't have that at the moment I prefer ply. Although wedges are slightly larger then what I actually made for my build. Since I don't have a band saw. To make them you need that. Once all of the pieces came I start the alignment. I measure the distance between the top and the bottom and they needed to be parallel because, in the end, I am going to join them to cover the front. Then I lock them to its place by placing the wedges onto the top portion with wood glue. By doing this the cabinet locks to its place and their weight is also too much that's why I decided not to drill holes for the permanent fixing. After installing the wedges I tried to pull it out but I am not able to move it even in millimetres 1 or 2. So I stop there and decided not to drill holes for the screw.

There is a total of 15 drawers in this build and in my all of the previous build, I never build that much amount of drawers. This is the only thing about which I am worried about but I think all of it ended up quite well. The drawers are going to be made with two different materials one of them is half-inch thick and other is the three-quarter inch thick. The portion on to which drawer slides have to be installed those are going to be made with three-quarter inch thick plywood and front and back has been made with half-inch thick ply.

Once the pieces have been cut down to the final dimensions I start doing the preparation for the joinery. For that, I decided to do the rabbit joints since this is the joint which I made in my past and to me, this one seems quite rigid and overall it's easy for me to build on to my homemade table saw. There is a total of 60 pieces on to which I need to make a rabbit. The three-quarter inch thick pieces have rabbits on three sides while the half-inch portion has rabbit on one side only and that was for the drawer bottom. Once the pieces have been cut down I move on to the process of joining them together to make a box-shaped which are going to be used as a drawer for this build. To join them together I approach with two different methods in which one of them I am using my right angle jig with the help of which I am going to hold two pieces of the draw together with a couple of clamps and then driven the screw with some glue onto the joint and then do the same with rest of the pieces. The second method is by using belt clamp for my drawer pieces. I join all of them together with the glue and that belt strap and then hold it with a couple of brad nails and then driven the screw to all of the four sides.

A very different experience with no sidewalks, street lights, and a lot fewer houses per mile.\n\nNow I have a family including a nine year old daughter.

The kids and parents were having a great time. I did a basic hatchback setup as a crime scene.

I break them down into three sizes... the tall ones are mainly used in the back, medium size In middle, and the smallest up front. The plastic spike stands make it easy to tape down, front and back, on carpet using shipping tape. It also easily removes for tear down.\nBefore I start taping down the tombstones I place the fog machine and power pack (not shown in photo) in the back of the bed underneath the tri-fold cover. I also run the extension cord and splitter. Make sure the fog machine is placed in the opening between two of the large tombstones (please read all safety instructions for proper use and placement) and of course don'r forget to fill with solution and plug in. I use three-way splitter for fog machine, black skull strobe, and rotating ghost projector. The other end of extension cord runs in front of bed, down below passenger side running board and up to inverter under hood (you'll probably need to leave hood slightly open). Please make sure you at least match wattage necessary for fog machine and lights. Also read all instructions for proper usage and safety precautions). And last but not least, keep an eye on your battery, You'll probably need to start your truck for a minute or two, every 30-60 min. That also helps to warm up the family during breaks on those cold nights!\nI also like to add a couple of dead graveyard trees. I just look around for some dead branches and hold them up with mic stands, or any weighted base to can find.\nNow comes the decorating. You can start staggering your tombstones, trees, skulls including strobe, raven, and owl. I save one of the large tombstones for my skeleton. I lay them both down against a wheel well and add cat nearby.\nThe final touches... Zombie tape, coffin candy dishes wrapped in brown felt (to simulate dug up dirt), and strobes aimed at candy.

I decided to try an old-style double edge safety razor. But, what if I decided it was not for me? I did not want a lot of money invested in a razor I later found unworkable for me. So, I bought a cast zinc alloy head with an open comb on one side and a closed comb on the other side. See the first photo. You can buy razor heads like this for less than $6 US delivered. Mine came from China and I waited a few weeks for it to arrive. You can order these from vendors on eBay. West Coast Shaving also sells cast heads. (Most razors have zinc alloy cast heads, unless you spend around $100 and up.) Since buying this, I have found, as others also say, there really is not much difference between an open comb head and a closed comb head, unless you have a heavy beard growth. But, in the meanwhile, I had decided I prefer a closed comb razor and I shelled out $30 US for a Merkur 23C. But, it was not as aggressive as I need for attacking my \"old man\" whiskers.\nWhat do you do when you buy a razor that gets very favorable reviews, but it does not work as you expected? Answer: You do what DE shavers have done for many decades. You shim the razor. Notice the red item with three holes in it from the first photo. It is a piece from a plastic file folder. You cut a piece of your chosen shim material and you use a common hole punch to accommodate the blade alignment studs in the head's cap piece. Then you place your shim between the blade and the bottom plate. This increases the blade exposure. Many people use an old razor blade from which they have trimmed the sharp edges. Some use more than one. If you need more than two, it might be good to look for a thicker shim material. There is a lot of YMMV (\"Your mileage may vary.\"). That means your face is different from everyone else's, also in what is needed to get a good shave. I now have a piece of a lid from a margarine tub as the shim in my Merkur 23C. It adds 0.035 inch, but my Merkur now does a much better job of giving my face a clean shave, and it very seldom cuts or nicks me. (See also below on shaving soap. I had been using a Castile soap in place of shaving cream. When I found real shaving soap, it made my whiskers stand up better, and my razor cut more efficiently. That was unexpected, and it is not always about the razor.)\nWhat about a handle? You can buy handles or borrow one from another razor. Some use 10-32 threads and others use M5 x .8 threads. Although not exactly the same, they are close enough to be interchangeable. I made a 4\" long handle from 3/8\" steel rod and added grooves for a good grip. I center drilled one end and tapped the hole for 10-32 threads. I heated it with a MAP gas torch and it turned a nice charcoal gray. I sprayed it with clear matte finish lacquer to protect from rusting.\nIf you break the screw stud... I am very careful with the screw stud in both of my razors. I do not overtighten and I smear some Vaseline on the threads regularly for lubrication. But, I see blog comments from people who broke the screw stud on a pretty good razor and now feel the need to buy a new razor. A guy at YouTube did a video on how he drilled a hole where the screw stud had been and used a stainless steel screw from the hardware store to attach his razor head. There is a word of caution, though. Razors costing less than $100 or so have heads cast from a zinc alloy known as zamak. It rots in the presence of water. Some protective coating will be needed to keep water away from the zinc alloy.\nShave stand-- I decided a shaving brush and soap would help me get a closer shave. I needed a shave stand to hold the brush so it can dry. They get expensive fast. I made my own from 1/8\" and 3/16\" steel rod. I found steel pipes to use as forms for bending radii needed. Then I used a MIG welder to weld the pieces together. I gave it all a satin finish with fine sandpaper and sprayed it with matte finish lacquer to protect from rusting.\nShave soap-- A mall store nearby specializes in supplies for men (faces and heads) and women (legs) who wish to shave with a DE razor. Shaving soap there is $30 or more per bar. A Castile soapmaker lists some uses on-line for their soap. Lather for shaving is one use. It does make a thinner lather, and multiple applications left my skin feeling a soap burn. I put a half teaspoon of my wife's hair conditioner into my lather bowl from the tableware section of Bed, Bath & Beyond ($3 US) and it mixes in quite well while whipping up the lather with my brush. My skin feels much better after multiple applications of the lather now. But, I also found actual shave soap for about $4 recently. It makes my whiskers stand up better for a really clean shave. I need more than one applications n before the whiskers stand up like they can, though.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FEC/L8QP/JNNF7O8J/FECL8QPJNNF7O8J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE0/JJXX/JNNF84KI/FE0JJXXJNNF84KI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Cheap Stuff"}], "channel": "Travel"}, {"category": "Home", "description": "A lot of modern tilt-in windows have spring-loaded counterbalances that are attached to the window with small plastic clips called shoes.

In winter, you'll want to suspend fertilizer if the plant goes dormant and stops actively growing.\nPropagating Baby Toes\nThis can be done from both the splitting of the the plant and by seeds produced after blooming, but the seedlings take forever to grow and are hard to keep alive. I recommend uprooting the Baby Toes plant and separating rooted sections with a sharp clean knife to propagate.\nFinding the Right Pot for Baby Toes\nBaby Toes need a pot that is similar in size to the actual plant. In most cases, a 4 inch pot will be more than enough room! These plants don't grow super fast or large, so a smaller pot will ensure you aren't overwatering your Baby Toes. I like to use terra cotta pots for my Baby Toes plant because it allows the soil to dry out faster. Avoid pots without holes - chances are you'll kill your plant by accident thanks to water sitting in the bottom between waterings!\nCheck out my instructable titled \"How to Choose the Right Planter or Pot for Your Plant\" for more information!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F83/5I4R/JNKL6SU7/F835I4RJNKL6SU7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Other Tips for Baby Toes Care"}], "channel": "Gardening"}, {"category": "Home", "description": "I wanted to produce something that was inspired by the book and 2016 movie, something that might even have a little magic of its own, but what to make?\nI didn't fancy the prospect of carving out an enormous Flesh Lump Eater, Bone Cruncher or Butcher boy! - so I slept on it....and had a dream!....\n\n\"Those who don't believe in magic will never find it\" - Roald Dahl\nSo, grab a Snozzcumber, pour yourself a glass of Frobscottle and lets see how I made this!", "title": "BFG INSPIRED SOPHIE'S DREAM LAMP", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/BFG-INSPIRED-SOPHIES-DREAM-LAMP/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I found an interesting old crate at a local car boot sale last year.

Detailed and unusual I think it fits my \u201cdoctor\u201d well!\nIt\u2019s a bit of a specific prop, maybe not suitable or hard to apply for some\u2026\nI sought long and hard for an exact fit, and found a meat-paste can that would fit this purpose! And in the end decided to even take the eyeglasses out of the gasmask. Now it sits in the rubber tightly. Mounted to the can is a small (plastic) magnifying lens, a small mason jar top and a microsized mobile phone clip-on camera lens. All together making a magnifying lens prop.\nYou\u2019ll need;\nA fitting can to the eyesocket of your mask\nA slightly smaller diameter mason jar top\nA small (plasic) magnifying lens\nA mobile phone clip-on camera lens\n2 mini screws\n1 mini-bolt + nut\nBlack spraypaint\nPiece of sandpaper\nElectric drill with small drillbit\nPiece of rebar wire\nPlier for shaping rebar wire\nContact cement/ epoxy/ strong adhesive\nBefore anything, cut out the bottom, leaving a 5mm rim. I sand the can down and give it a matte black spray. The sides of the glass lid is also sprayed black. The rubber ring is dirtied-up\nThe magnifying lens is connected with a single mini bolt with nut. I dap the nut with a tiny bit contact cement making sure not to glue them to the can or anything else but eachother!\nBy the single-screw-mounting I\u2019m able to pivot it out of the way \u201cwhen needed\u201d. By putting in a miniscrew in the rim I create a contact-point so I can\u2019t over-pivot, it makes it a one-way open and close system. The second miniscrew is just for looks.\nYou only need the metal closing parts (iron frame) and the top (lid), not the actual jar. So take it apart and you need to turn the glass lid around in the metal holder.\nThe can needs 4 holes drilled and slightly enlarged for the metal closing parts to fit through. The closure was too small to stick out both sides of the can so I made a replacement out of rebar wire using pliers.\nI was a bit lucky for the mechanism to snap-lock on the first try\nSimply glued into place is a \u2018fish-eye\u2019 clip-on lens for a mobile phone. After spraypainting it black I turned it around so its conically sloping towards the end. To cover up the glue sticking to the ousides I loop around a bit of weathered rope.\nFor people wondering; No, I can\u2019t see very well through there when its closed!\nThe other eye\nThe other eye needs something aswell, less elaborated, but you can\u2019t leave it plain. Something you can actually see something through! So this is what I came up with;\nMedical tape roll cover; fits the eyesocket from the gasmask and has a ribbed texture (at least its not smooth\u2026).\nRagged piece of cloth; wrapped around the tape cover for layering, effect and bringing in some color\nRagged piece of burlap; wrapped around the tape cover for layering, effect and cover the red fabric up a bit\n8x8cm piece of metal mosquito mesh; balling out the end. Will cover people looking in but I can look out!\nGlues; fabricglue and contact adhesive\nBlack spraypaint; for spraying the tape-cover\nI sprayed the whole thing black to start off with. Stupid me\u2026 leave the bottom half centimeter unsprayed so glues will stick. I had to sand and scratch some off again!\nI ragged up 2 small pieces of fabric on 1 side.\nThe red fabric was 4cm wide and after ragging up one side I even cut that half that! I covered only the back of the tape-cover with a little bit of contact adhesive and wrap round the fabric inside the last plastic rim from the tape-cover (see pictures). I cut it off so I have no overlap.\nThe burlap just needed some plucking, pulling loose some fibers. I wrap I around and only glue where the ends meet (I hope that stuff dries clear\u2026 otherwise I\u2019ll take a black permanent marker to it!). when its dried I had the cut the strands that stick over the rim where it will be inserted into the eyesocket of the gasmask.\nI tried to pre-shape the mosquito mesh a bit before sticking it in the tape-cover. Just making sure it balls out enough and isn\u2019t crooked or gapped somewhere. With just a couple dots of contact adhesive its glued to the inside.\nMounting inside the gasmask\nSince both my can and the tape rollcover are exactly fitting in the rubber eyesockets I had an easy job. The tape cover gets a good glue line on the rim (which we cut free from cloth and strands). Work the rubber around the rim carefully to not smear glue all over the place. When the glue set a bit, I went round gluing at a couple more connecting spots.\nThe lensprop is a little heavier and is conically shaped so after a lot of wiggling it pops inside the eyesocket. I could (and will) glue this up aswell, but for a bit more \u2018peace of mind\u2019 and hopefully a little bit angling possibilities, I\u2019ll first connect the can with 3 mini bolts and nuts to the rubber from the eyesocket.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Eyelens"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "A walking staff is a great prop and/ or add-on for a shaman, death-doctor, tribal-chief or any other dark themed character! This one can be a real eyecatcher! You can get very elaborated with your deco\u2019s (and that\u2019s exactly what I intend to do for my complete Halloween costume!). Mine gets a skull mounted on the top. The staff is fairy long, about 2.2m, and will stick out above a crowd!\nAfter searching the woods I had 4 potential staffs. The one I preferred most (the longest, probably because its y-split near the top) didn\u2019t have enough depth, it\u2019s to straight-up. I needed my staff to have a crooked and sudden bend just above shoulderheight, so I can hang extra props off the staff! So I choose the second-choice-staff for functionality.\n1 thing I will try to accomplish is making it real-life-safe. I wanted to put a dead, thorny bush along the top, but this might not be the smartest idea considering there\u2019s other people around.\nWooden stick; preferably: crooked and at least shoulder height\nBunch of feathers\nHot glue and/or textile glue\nHandful of fine twigs\nA couple of dirty rags\n3 garlic cloves\nJute twine\nPatch of leather 25x15cm\nLeather handle\nFor extra comfort and detail I decided to put a leather handle on the walking staff. It used to be a handbag, found during one of my scavenger-hunts. I intentionally cut it off at a bit of an angle and left the bottom thick band on. After ripping it up a bit more using a serrated kitchenknife, I wrapped it round the staff and glued it onto itself using textileglue, securing it for drying with those garbagebag-twisters.\nFeathers\nAs you can see I put the thick edge of the bag as the bottom of the handle. This creates a hand-rest and gives me space to stick a bunch of feathers in the bottom using a bit of hot-glue. To cover up/ add to the detail I cover the bottom edge with fine-as-birdsnests twigs and such (you\u2019ll have to first pull the handle up a bit and glue and stick some birdsnest material into place and then a drop of glue on the pointy tip of the feather and stick it through the birdsnest material).\nRags\nFor extra detail I dirtied-up some burlap and rags and ripped them up in about 4cm wide strips. Like the leather strap from the handle, I ripped up one side of the strap. I put a little textile glue to stick the rag onto itself when wrapped around the staff and already inserted another rag (another color) before the end of the first rag. Some rags have their tail-ends hanging loose (the red and black burlap).\nGarlic cloves suspended on jute twine\nYeah, I mean, DUH!\nI\u2019ll suspend a couple on a bare part of the staff. Using a leather working tool (no idea of the name) I pull jute twine through the top of a clove and wrap it around at least a couple times so it will stick in place. Because jute twine isn\u2019t that strong I decided to tie them to the staff, instead of letting them dangle.\nFunFact; The plague doctors back in the 16th and 17th century chewed raw garlic all day! They believed it helped them prevent getting the disease.\nBells and whistles\nThe work is in the details! So add some bells, bones, skull, teeth, thorny brush, barbed wire, etc. etc. Scratch it up like you fought off a bear, stain it up with fake bloodsplatter like you knocked out 25 plague-victims, carve it up with strange \u201cspell symbols\u201d or paint pretty little hearts on it!\nI added a skull with a piece of spine, some smaller teeth woven into the jute twine suspended below the leather handle, some frayed ends of rope and some blood-staining to the bottom 20cm of the staff.\nI will say its pretty easy overdoing it! Also stick to your theme; for a steampunk/ cyberlook you could add bunches of electrical wire and sharpened circuitboards as props, but this would not match with a witch-doctor offcourse!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUP/0QCQ/JN0L3DVE/FUP0QCQJN0L3DVE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK7/076P/JN0L3DLT/FK7076PJN0L3DLT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0C/HAT0/JMKVKETE/F0CHAT0JMKVKETE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU9/7WIQ/JMKVEAFT/FU97WIQJMKVEAFT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEO/RXO4/JMKVKEM5/FEORXO4JMKVKEM5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5L/FVCO/JMKVKENI/F5LFVCOJMKVKENI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY1/P31J/JMKVKEOZ/FY1P31JJMKVKEOZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSI/WO2T/JMKVKEP6/FSIWO2TJMKVKEP6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK1/QOUO/JMKVKEPB/FK1QOUOJMKVKEPB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6E/G98G/JMKVKEQC/F6EG98GJMKVKEQC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F50/6QLC/JMKVKEQG/F506QLCJMKVKEQG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F24/YA51/JMKVKEQX/F24YA51JMKVKEQX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBK/CC4V/JN0L3IMP/FBKCC4VJN0L3IMP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHM/TV59/JMKVKEUT/FHMTV59JMKVKEUT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO8/0P1I/JMKVKEUW/FO80P1IJMKVKEUW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE5/HAFN/JMKVKEYE/FE5HAFNJMKVKEYE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0J/32AG/JMKVKEW0/F0J32AGJMKVKEW0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLD/D242/JMKVKF2F/FLDD242JMKVKF2F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOT/ALSK/JMKVKF32/FOTALSKJMKVKF32.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F04/EIJJ/JMKVKF4K/F04EIJJJMKVKF4K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5B/6NWK/JMKVKERE/F5B6NWKJMKVKERE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEC/MFT7/JMKVKESV/FECMFT7JMKVKESV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMJ/EHK5/JN0L3IN0/FMJEHK5JN0L3IN0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Walking Staff"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Cleaning your skull, bones and teeth\nIf you, like me, went on a (morbid) scavenger-hunt for the walking staff and bones you have some cleaning up to do. I used a very weak hydrogen peroxide solution to clean and whiten my (already pretty clean) skull and bones.\n$1.50,- and straight out of the bottle (3%) I submerged the skull and bones for about 15 \u2013 24 hours.\nNow with a scrubby pad and a dishwashing bristle I simply brush all leftover goo off.\nIf your bones are dirtier (or fresher) as mine, you might have a couple of additional steps. Check out here (momgoescamping) on how to!\nOne extra step I take before handling the skull too much is giving all the teeth a dap of instant contact adhesive (on the inside of the jaw so it doesn\u2019t show!). Some of the tooth-sockets are in pretty bad shape.\nConnecting the halves of the lower jaw\nI joined the 2 halves of lower jaw bones together after glueing all the teeth. By laying the skull upside down I could lay the 2 separate lower halves of jaws into the correct position. You can check the alignment on 4 spots to get a perfect fit (see picture);\n1. The jawsockets; when the jaw is closed these should have a complementary shape to eachother and fit perfectly on/ into one another.\n2. The corinoid; the big flat part at the beginning of the jawbone needs to sit straight and in the middle of the (eye/muscle) cavity.\n3. The teeth; they should fit eachother quite tightly, SNAP-fit! The k-9\u2019s lock-up through eachother.\n4. Split-jaw; when you lay the separate jaws into the skull, they meet up in the middle by leaning against eachother. This used to be filled up with ligaments or tissue, which I substitute with a piece of wooden coffee-stirrer. The split needed to be separated just a tad.\nSo I dropped a bunch of glue in the split with the small piece of wooden coffee-stirrer and with the rest of that stirrer I bridged in between je back part of its jaws.

Painters tape still holding it in place temporary so I can check for connection-options!\nThe holes of the nose will be perfect for connecting the front parts together. Ill do this with 2 garbagebag-twisters.\nBend them in the middle, sticking the loops up through the nostril-cavity and using a small burlap-sack-staple to hook though the loops. You can simply tie the twisters off around the lower jaws now.

Then I hung the whole thing up-side-down and glued it together onto the top of the staff. I used silicone painters chalk for this, any other glue wasn\u2019t thick enough and would run.\nNow I\u2019m pretty sure I can swing this staff like a baseballbat without it coming off!\nEyeball\nI took one of the eyeballs from the \u201cBag \u2018o Eyeballs\u201d (a deco piece I made) and glued a 8cm piece of frayed rope to the back. I drenched the rope in the commercial fake blood spray I had and let it dry completely. It turned stiff and a bit pale, like a dried-out sinew. I stuck the loose end of rope in one of the natural holes in the back of the skull. Use good contact cement and a wooden BBQ-skewer.

Note that I didn\u2019t clean this spine at all, I didn\u2019t want to risk the connecting tissue coming off or falling apart. With a little wiggling and pre-shaping a long piece of rebar-wire I\u2019m able to stick the wire all the way through the spine, top to bottom, all pieces!\nThe top is jammed up against the skull and right where the beginning sits, I drill a small hole through the walking staff. The top wire on the spine get passed through this hole and bend 90 degrees, tightly against the staff.\nI broke the 4th and 5th sinew-connection of the spine (cracked it, not snapped it!) so it would shape more like the staff.\nThe bottom wire, coming out its \u2018tail\u2019, is tightly wrapped once around the staff keeping everything in place!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F65/4DNY/JMKVEAAL/F654DNYJMKVEAAL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR7/VRLD/JN0L3DVR/FR7VRLDJN0L3DVR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDE/0FEV/JN0L3DWA/FDE0FEVJN0L3DWA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD2/2HBT/JMKVKG6Q/FD22HBTJMKVKG6Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNC/TIZS/JMKVKG8J/FNCTIZSJMKVKG8J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHK/HOMS/JMKVKG8L/FHKHOMSJMKVKG8L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNW/FZAE/JMKVKG8M/FNWFZAEJMKVKG8M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGF/D1JG/JMKVKG8P/FGFD1JGJMKVKG8P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJI/QLB2/JMKVKG8Q/FJIQLB2JMKVKG8Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB0/M2CI/JMKVKGB7/FB0M2CIJMKVKGB7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F97/LIIY/JMKVKGD5/F97LIIYJMKVKGD5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY8/T7PJ/JMKVKGF6/FY8T7PJJMKVKGF6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT4/CFS3/JMKVKGF7/FT4CFS3JMKVKGF7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F60/7DZO/JMKVKGJ2/F607DZOJMKVKGJ2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJN/SV5K/JMKVKGJF/FJNSV5KJMKVKGJF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F18/3891/JN0L3DWI/F183891JN0L3DWI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0C/YMB2/JN0L3DWX/F0CYMB2JN0L3DWX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8F/L126/JN0L3DVX/F8FL126JN0L3DVX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJN/VFLA/JN0L3E9S/FJNVFLAJN0L3E9S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3J/Y95H/JN0L3E9T/F3JY95HJN0L3E9T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F59/GS16/JN0L3E9U/F59GS16JN0L3E9U.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Skull on a Staff"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "For certain costumes, a potion or poison-sling would be a real addition! Small, corked, glass vails with the liquids of a breaklight that give the impression of poison.\nThe harness\nI\u2019m using 2 old leather belts, one with and one without a buckle. The one without the buckle is connected to (looped around) my actual \u2018belt\u2019 (the thick rope with the noose).\nThe end of one belt is looped through the side of the buckle from the other belt and connected onto itself using a screw-into-eachother screw and two washers. This will be the backside; the buckle is a too modern item for my costume.\nThe front is looped around the other belt aswell and also connected using a screw-into-eachother screw. To cover this up I used an old leather bracelet with a gemstone, wrapped it around, and riveted it closed (the pop button was broken). Don\u2019t forget to cut off the excess belt!\nVails\nI bought some clear crafting jars that already came with a cork. These will be for the glowing stuff! In the pictures you see an example, I\u2019ll fill them up half way on the 31st!\nThe brown vails are nose-spray bottles and I cut fitting corks out of wine-bottle-corks. I\u2019ll put some crushed multivitamin tablet in, the ones that sizzle.\nTo clean the labelresidue off I use some nailpolish-remover.\nI happen to find a very small terracotta vail wit a cork! Nice addition!\nVail \u2018pockets\u2019\nI intend to let my poison-bottles glow, so I want to cover the bottles the least amount possible. They will be non-removable, so no \u2018funny-business\u2019 will happen!\nVails will be laying in the same direction of belt; the necks will be faux-leather-cord-wrapped and stuck through the belt, securing it to the belt. I punch 2 holes per bottle in the belt. The top one is on neck-height and the bottom one about 5mm up from the bottom of the bottle. My belt isn\u2019t wide enough for straight-up standing bottles, so I\u2019m mounting them horizontally (with the belt).\nI loop the thin cord around the neck 3 times and knot it off leaving some cord sticking out. Work both cords through the top hole, the longer piece goes through the bottom hole, loops around the bottom of the bottle and goed back through the hole again. Now tie it off to the shorter piece still sticking out the top hole. This holds 3 bottles on the belt.\nHanging on twine from the other belt are a couple of brown bottles dangling through a single punched hole and separated from them a small terracotta vail.\nFlask\nI saw this awesome chemistry-style glass vase at a friend\u2019s house and asked if I could borrow it. What a nice add-on this would make for my poison-sling! Also half filled with breaklight fluids!\nI made a holder for it using 4 straps 20cm of leather, 1 push-button and 1 screw-into-eachother screw and a piece of jute twine.\n2 small pieces of rebar-wire are optional, highly recommended tho\u2026.\nThe straps are salvaged from a woman\u2019s purse. It has holes on one side already and the length is just right! I use one of the holes to connect all straps together with the screw-into-eachtother screw. A (quick)rivet would do the same trick! The ends of the bottom straps are connected together (at approx. 90degrees) with the bottom part of a push-button and the ends of the top straps are connected together with, you guessed it, the top part of a push-button!\nTo make sure the bottle doesn\u2019t fall out of the bottom I connect the bottom straps using rebar-wire, at the bottom of the bottle. This way the bottom straps can\u2019t slide anywhere!\nI\u2019m using 2 additional holes (already in mine) at the back for a quick and easy hanging rope.\nIf you make this rope just long enough to fit the neck of the bottle through, it will sway less when walking.\nWith 1 other small piece of strap I give the neck a \u2018collar\u2019, just detailing.\nIf I want to put up a \u201cshow\u201d, I can pour the crushed multivitamin in a glass of water, let sizzle a couple seconds and gulp in front of others. Because it comes from your poison-sling, people will freak out!\nI can also pivot my flask filled with breaklight fluids up-side-down, pouring the liquid into a glass or cup and offer it to some wiseass!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUU/YI93/JN0L2NRJ/FUUYI93JN0L2NRJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOE/AHXI/JN0L2NQ6/FOEAHXIJN0L2NQ6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLX/S620/JN0L3F9P/FLXS620JN0L3F9P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCU/O27V/JMKVEAHL/FCUO27VJMKVEAHL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6P/2LWS/JN0L2NDL/F6P2LWSJN0L2NDL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAO/AVMZ/JN0L2NEF/FAOAVMZJN0L2NEF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5Y/ODAJ/JN0L2NEX/F5YODAJJN0L2NEX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTB/SHC8/JN0L2NFD/FTBSHC8JN0L2NFD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMR/SPZ4/JN0L2NFU/FMRSPZ4JN0L2NFU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT2/400U/JN0L2NG0/FT2400UJN0L2NG0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F30/NTMH/JN0L2NGI/F30NTMHJN0L2NGI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBC/TBXJ/JN0L2NGQ/FBCTBXJJN0L2NGQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F81/Q9CI/JN0L3F6N/F81Q9CIJN0L3F6N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXW/0IZO/JN0L3F39/FXW0IZOJN0L3F39.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAS/XHNR/JN0L3F4X/FASXHNRJN0L3F4X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F99/UVR4/JN0L3F8B/F99UVR4JN0L3F8B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F75/G3VP/JN0L2NH7/F75G3VPJN0L2NH7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7U/ZA1V/JN0L2NHE/F7UZA1VJN0L2NHE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZA/6K98/JN0L2NHG/FZA6K98JN0L2NHG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAF/C55K/JN0L2NHW/FAFC55KJN0L2NHW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUZ/2R8U/JN0L2NIO/FUZ2R8UJN0L2NIO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPC/FDCI/JN0L2NJ7/FPCFDCIJN0L2NJ7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTW/P0BI/JN0L418Y/FTWP0BIJN0L418Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4X/MJ52/JN0L419O/F4XMJ52JN0L419O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSV/FISV/JN0L2NJJ/FSVFISVJN0L2NJJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDH/44WT/JN0L2NKP/FDH44WTJN0L2NKP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV3/TRTZ/JN0L2NLT/FV3TRTZJN0L2NLT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9C/B3T1/JN0L2NM9/F9CB3T1JN0L2NM9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPM/0F78/JN0L2NN6/FPM0F78JN0L2NN6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTQ/C17K/JN0L2NPM/FTQC17KJN0L2NPM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE3/5J5E/JN0L2NR3/FE35J5EJN0L2NR3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Potion/ Poison Sling"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "The main cape or cloak is going to be quite the important prop. It will cover most of my body and so will get a lot of attention just because of it size. I had a long jacket from my grandma (fugly as hell, didn\u2019t even sell at a porchsale for next to none\u2026) and messed it up completely after trying to dye it black twice\u2026 Note to self; 100% polyester doesn\u2019t hold a dye well\u2026 (read; at all!)\nSo instead of a jacket, my costume is getting a cloak. Mainly connected on the shoulders and the hood will be quite big. It can\u2019t cover too much of the front tho, props need to be visible!\nI have a couple old curtains (mainly cotton, fairly thick stuff) and one of them, measuring 200x135cm is just about enough for a full length cloak. A piece of a second curtain is used for the hood.\nWhen you have your hood and cloak the super-simple way I connect them is by simply pulling the corners through a bronze, conically shaped, fitting. This is all that creates the shape and connectionpieces for my hooded cloak. These bronze fittings will be connected to a cordura strap that acts as carry-harness.\nMy cloak is just long enough to be trailing or dragging. Nice effect, not very practical\u2026 just saying.\nDying\nSo, first things first, it needed to be black, ripped up and dirty as if I\u2019ve been wearing it longer as Santa Claus has been around!\nI removed the rod-rings by cutting off the entire strip. From another one I cut out the pattern for a hood (google searched on images; pattern hooded cloak to get a basic idea). I bought some black fabric dye and went into the kitchen!\nI couldn\u2019t find a big enough pot to boil 8L of water in, so I boiled the fist 4L, threw it in a 5GL bucket, put on the next 4L, mixed the dye in the first 4L, mixed the second 4L of boiling water through the dye-mix and then put the curtains in. Offcourse it didn\u2019t want to stay submerged, so after stirring and turning over the cloth meticulously, making sure dye would reach everywhere, I grabbed an old BBQ-grill and used it to push the cloth under water.\nI\u2019m leaving it in longer as the instruction say to. I can\u2019t keep heating the water like the instruction want, so I hope a bit more time will achieve the same effect.\nAfter about 4 hours of saturating, a rinse, a wash, another fail! Too much fabric, I guess\u2026 until I found out this isn\u2019t 100% cotton either\u2026 probably 50/50.\nI\u2019ll have to get away with it under the weathering-excuse; \u201cit\u2019s just old and sunbleached!\u201d being more grey as black\u2026\nDistressing and grunging\nDistressing means to tear it up, rip holes and make your gear look worn, old and ragged.\nGrunging simply means dirting it up! Make it look used, aged, weathered and worn.\nI overthought this step way too much and didn\u2019t get myself to actually do it for quite some time! Watching video after video on how-to\u2019s, they all basically use the same techniques; serrated knifes, saw blades, exacto blades and sandpaper for ripping and tearing. Spray paints, dirt and babypowder for the staining and aging.\nSo instead of trying to explain how and what exactly I\u2019m doing, would be confusing to say the least! Instead check out \u201cNuclear Snail Studios\u201d grunge tutorial. A German guy who makes the awesomest post-apocalyptic gear!\nI used a scissor to put in some initial cuts and get the straight bottom edge a bit less straight! A couple cuts mid-way using a Stanley-knife and then the ragging-up starts (all the cuts so far are way too straight, too made). I used a reciprocal wood saw blade to begin my ripping but switched to a reciprocal iron saw quite fast because the wood saw was way too aggressive.\nThe bottom is very ragged and is gradually less torn the more I go up.\nI tried to leave the hood a little more intact, at least no BIG holes! The edge is weathered all the way.\nSewing\nThe hood is pretty straightforward. Turn it inside out and sew along the back-line. When done lay \u2018the hem\u2019 onto the topside of the cloak. Find the middle and sew this point to the middle of the hood.\nThe hood is shorter as the cloak, you\u2019ll have to ball up or double up on the cloak at a couple of spots before you sew them together. I put on one of my bronze fittings temporary so I can find the right spots to secure the hood to the cloak with pins. This creates wrikles, or overlap in your cloak and will also make it drape over the shoulders nicely.\nI take it side by side. First the right side of the hood, seen from the middlepoint. Then the left.\nHarness\nI decided to make a quick and easy harness for the cloak. This so I can easily put it on and it will have a fixed position with the costume. The picture shows a cordura strap of 1.30m with a fitting buckle. It was a carpenters-belt.\nI\u2019m fastening the cylindrical bronze fittings (that hold the corners of the cloak and hood together) to the cordura belt using those screw-into-eachother screws.\nThe hooded cloak is connected only by the bronze fittings, you could connect it to the cordura strap if you like, sewing, small rivets with washers, small screw/into/eachother screws are all options. Because cordura against bare skin doesn\u2019t feel that nice, I\u2019ve sewn a small strap (leftover cotton from the hood) around the strap.\nCape-connector\nIn between the bronze fittings I\u2019ll hang a small chain with a pendant and 4 pieces of scavenged spinebones. The pendant is an old wire broch and will \u201csignify my medical training\u201d (FunFact; normally signified by a wide brimmed hat, they often carried something like a pendant or broch, like sheriffs had a star in \u2018the wild west\u2019).\nTo hold everything in place I\u2019m tying the bones and broch with garbagebag twisters onto the chain.\nI\u2019m using a piece of rebar-wire with a small hook at the end to pull the chain through the bronze fitting while the cloths are already in. lining up the shackle with the hole I screw in the tiny bolt and using a pliers holding the nut at the back (the bronze fitting had this threaded hole already). I screw it tight onto the fabric from the cloak and hood.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F42/4CEZ/JN0L3I48/F424CEZJN0L3I48.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWD/QHSO/JN0L3H6Q/FWDQHSOJN0L3H6Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F54/3EOJ/JN0L3H4X/F543EOJJN0L3H4X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3U/CAJY/JMKVKIQB/F3UCAJYJMKVKIQB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEX/FEV9/JMKVKIEC/FEXFEV9JMKVKIEC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ9/LQOT/JMKVKIEM/FQ9LQOTJMKVKIEM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOB/FU0V/JMKVKIET/FOBFU0VJMKVKIET.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ1/F295/JMKVKIF3/FQ1F295JMKVKIF3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC3/WUAH/JMKVKIF7/FC3WUAHJMKVKIF7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU0/8OSY/JMKVKIFH/FU08OSYJMKVKIFH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9J/IDDK/JMKVKIFO/F9JIDDKJMKVKIFO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F33/SQBU/JMKVKIFS/F33SQBUJMKVKIFS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F33/ZLMF/JMKVKIFT/F33ZLMFJMKVKIFT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEU/UGNA/JMKVKIFU/FEUUGNAJMKVKIFU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAX/BDDD/JMKVKIFV/FAXBDDDJMKVKIFV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZO/TXL1/JN0L3H4T/FZOTXL1JN0L3H4T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCD/T6WU/JN0L3H4U/FCDT6WUJN0L3H4U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F17/3I4Q/JN0L3H4V/F173I4QJN0L3H4V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F13/OE3H/JMKVKIQ5/F13OE3HJMKVKIQ5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL8/SKOW/JMKVKIQ6/FL8SKOWJMKVKIQ6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ2/T5XJ/JMKVKIQ8/FZ2T5XJJMKVKIQ8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6H/BHR8/JMKVKIPP/F6HBHR8JMKVKIPP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1V/UUZ9/JMKVKIPT/F1VUUZ9JMKVKIPT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLE/5SXO/JMKVKJAL/FLE5SXOJMKVKJAL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXM/R1FZ/JMKVKJBT/FXMR1FZJMKVKJBT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5A/75OM/JMKVKJEO/F5A75OMJMKVKJEO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2F/RD6M/JN0L3H4Y/F2FRD6MJN0L3H4Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7S/81UF/JN0L3H4Z/F7S81UFJN0L3H4Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEA/PT9G/JN0L3H5O/FEAPT9GJN0L3H5O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR7/FGD4/JN0L3H5P/FR7FGD4JN0L3H5P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJP/VXG7/JN0L3H5S/FJPVXG7JN0L3H5S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTR/SCHV/JN0L3H5X/FTRSCHVJN0L3H5X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRA/WHWO/JN0L3H5Y/FRAWHWOJN0L3H5Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHX/4EUY/JN0L3H6C/FHX4EUYJN0L3H6C.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Torn Hooded Cloak"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "This is a real noose, used to, well you know\u2026 DON\u2019T mess around with this!\n\nAs a prop in my case, or as a deco to be hung all over the place!!

What you need in order to do that is a pen, a pencil, and a notebook, to write down some ideas and connect them with each other. If you want to work out the plans you've written down, it's also useful to get a laptop, so the writing process goes a bit faster.\nYou're writing a horror story. The main goal of this genre is to scare the living hell out of your audience. In order to reach the perfect mindset to liberate the darkest parts of your imagination, you need to stimulate your senses. Play scary music (bombastic classical music, for instance, or Nick Cave's Murder Ballads, for your daily dose of death), turn down the lights, and use candles instead. Watch the flames cast flickering shadows on the wall. Pour yourself a glass of wine (preferably red), and read. A lot. Read all the classics of Horror. Immerse yourself in the books of your predecessors, and let them inspire you. Make sure your mood is as dark and dreary as possible, as only then you can write your own horror story. In a way, you need to be afraid of your own creation, too.\nAre you there? Have you entered that special state of mind where you find you're starting to get scared of every little sound, and do you feel the inspiration flowing through your veins? Good.

You have to find the joy in writing, and don't want to get mixed up in unnecessary details. So, write about what you know, and not what you think is interesting or will deserve your audience's respect. This way you can fully focus on your story, and not spend weeks doing research on, for instance, the climate of South Wales in the eighteenth century or other such nonsense. If you write about what you know, you'll feel comfortable within your own story and the story will almost write itself.\nWe shouldn't get too comfortable, though. Therefore, the next step you have to take is a scary one: Write about what you fear. Your most critical reader is, of course, you. So when you think a story is scary, it probably is. This is why you need to think about what scares you. If you think living dolls are guaranteed to keep you up at night, then write about that. If you're afraid of snakes, then that's your topic.\nThis would mean that I would have to write about spiders. There, the truth is out there, and please don't use it against me. I would have to write about how spiders, big or small ones, are breeding so much they're everywhere, and they've become immune to cold weather, poison, and vacuum cleaners. For instance.\nWell, no.

Reading this Instructable will not help you write the perfect horror story. There is no golden rule you can follow which will allow you to write a bestseller, and authors definitely don't agree on how to start writing. Some of them start with developing the characters. There are those who mainly think about what they want to say with their story, and others plot out their whole novel before writing a single letter. What works for Stephen King is focusing on the situation. He works out so-called \"what if?\" questions without using any notes or scrap paper. Since he is one of the world's best-selling horror writers - and that's the genre we're trying our hand at now - it might be good to stick with his idea.\nSo this is what you need before you start writing your actual story: a short \"what if\" question to think about for some time. Don't think about anything else, you just need the big story line which you will develop as you work through the next steps.\nWriting a horror story could be relatively easy, as it is always about people who encounter something scary. So the question you need to ask yourself is what will happen in your story. What is the situation you want to write about?\nTake a look at the picture for inspiration.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGW/DEMF/JMKV6W9L/FGWDEMFJMKV6W9L.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: This Is What Will Happen - the Situation"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The main plot is there. Usually, I would say that you should start with developing your main characters before you take a look at what they will be doing and what they will be fighting. However, since you're writing a horror story, you should definitely focus on the Conflict. The Bad Guy. The Villain. The Enemy. The Monster. Evil.\nWhatever you want to call it, it needs to be scary. The best horror books are so scary that on the one hand you want to hurl your book against the wall in terror because you can't bear to continue reading, while on the other hand you really do want to keep reading because you can't bear the thought of not knowing what will happen next.\nSo all you need is the perfect scary person which your main characters (see the following step) will be fighting. Look at the picture for some questions you might ask yourself when thinking up your Bad Guy.\nInformative note: In the nineteenth century, writers were absolutely obsessed by this particular feeling of repulsion and attraction, and called it the Sublime. We'll be aiming for that, too (that's right, we're not just writing any horror story, nope, we're trying to write the best, the scariest, the goriest, the bloodiest story - ever).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXC/DZHQ/JMKV6WB5/FXCDZHQJMKV6WB5.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Something Is Going on - the Conflict"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Now that you've settled on the Bad Guy, it's time to think about who will face them.

They can be perfect, or flawed. They can be old or young, male or female. It's all up to you, of course, but bear in mind that the decisions you make here influence the rest of your steps.\nTake a look at the picture for questions you need to ask yourself in order to think about what kind of hero you want to feature in your story.\nInformative note: Have you ever heard of the Iceberg Theory? Ernest Hemingway said it's useful to omit certain things. You know about them, but it's more interesting to let the audience guess at a deeper meaning, or at a specific aspect of your characters. So ask yourself the following questions without giving the answer in your story: Why did you pick these characters? Why are they important for you, and for your story? Do you like them, and why?

Do make sure, however, that your setting makes sense. It's not a good idea to have a bunch of girly cheerleaders run around in an ancient castle without phone reception. It would take too much time to explain how they would have ended up there. Focus on the story instead.\nNote: While the setting is one of the most important aspects of a horror story, make sure this is not the first step you take.

This means the background is almost part of the story in the same way a character is. Others work really well because the descriptions are kept at a bare minimum. Some writers love using symbolism and metaphors, while it could also really work to just describe what's there and leave it at that.\nIt's also a good idea to think about what you want to describe when it comes to blood and death (because hey, it's a horror story, people are supposed to die in them). Do you prefer telling in detail how a body is slowly pulled apart, including sound effects and an in-depth description of tendons snapping, or would you rather leave that to the imagination of the audience? These are things you need to consider while writing, as it influences the kind of horror story you want to tell. One focuses on mystery, while the other's goal is to show everything with the explicit goal of grossing out your audience.\nInformative note: If you decide you want to include many descriptions, think about applying stylistic devices.

The most important aspect is that you create a sense of mystery, and that the audience knows just as little as the characters. It's no fun knowing that someone will die on the next page, or pointing out that Evil will definitely be defeated.\nThere are several ways in which you can make the story as exciting as possible. You could change the perspective between the main characters, or have only one of them express his or her opinions, by using a first-person perspective. You could also decide not to share any of your character's thoughts, but mainly describe what's happening. Or you could change everything and have everything from the point of view of the monster itself. Or you could use flashbacks, or you could ...\nIt's all up to you, but do bear in mind that creating a layer of mystery is the most important goal here.\nLook at the picture for inspiration.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWG/YI3H/JMKV6XQX/FWGYI3HJMKV6XQX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: He Saw Something They Didn't - the Perspective"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "So, as soon as you've made up your mind about all these steps, it's time to decide what you want to do with the ending.

Or are you commercially inclined, and therefore hint at a possible sequel?\nThink of what makes sense to you. It's not about the audience. If you think it's a good idea to kill off all your characters and have your Evil dance on their graves, then so be it. There's nothing wrong with an angry audience.

There's a pathway leading through our yard that begins at the sidewalk and to enter you need to walk through an entryway where these torches are lit and it just sets the stage for the experience. They look awesome and they're crazy simple to make!\nThis build uses a plastic skull from the big box store and one of the classic Tiki citronella torches commonly found in yards all over the world.\nMATERIALS:\nTiki Torch\nBrown Twine\nPlastic Skull\nHot Glue\nWood Stain\nPaper Towels\nPiece of Paper\nTOOLS:\nHot Glue Gun\nScissors\nRotary Tool or Saw (To Cut the Skull)\nBlack Marker", "title": "DIY Skull Torches", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Skull-Torches/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "What we like about these plastic skulls from the big box stores is that they have great sculpts and they're the appropriate size, but they definitely look very white and \"plastic-ey\". Luckily, this is really easy to fix.\nUsing some old oil-based wood stain, we liberally cover the entire skull with stain. We make sure to get all the small cracks, nooks and crannies of the skull. After about ten minutes, we use a clean rag to wipe off the excess stain but leave a few blotches here and there for effect. The stain we're using is a Dark Walnut color. It's great for this effect because it's dark brown but has some grey in it which gives it that \"old & dirty\" look.\nDuring most of this process, the removable Jaw was taken off so it was easier to work with.\nThis stain we're using takes about 24 hours to dry and it's important to let it dry completely before continuing. If you don't want to wait 24 hours, you can find alternatives like water based stain and brown paint, but in our experience this works best and lasts the longest.\nOptionally you can dry brush some different colors on the skull but in our case this looked great so we moved on!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUC/AS5A/JNCCWA3K/FUCAS5AJNCCWA3K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4Q/OA20/JNCCWA3N/F4QOA20JNCCWA3N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1I/O88W/JNCCWA3O/F1IO88WJNCCWA3O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9G/T09E/JNCCWDS3/F9GT09EJNCCWDS3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Aging the Skull!"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "We removed the oil canister from the skull and then held it upside down to trace a template on a piece of paper. This circle was then cut out with scissors and we placed it on top of the skull, tracing the outline with a black marker. The placement of the circle here is optional but remember that wherever you place it on top, it has to come out of the bottom. If you make a bunch of these, this is a good way to add some variance to the builds.\nWe started by using a rotary tool with a cutting disk to cut out the top. In hindsight, a hole saw drill bit would have been better but we didn't think of it in time. After cutting out the bulk of the waste, a drum sanding bit was used to clean up the edges. We held up the torch and it didn't quite fit so we used the marker to mark where it needed to be adjusted and did a few more passes with the drum sanding bit. In a short time, it fit perfectly.\nFor the bottom, we used a straight edge to roughly mark where the hole should go (see video/pics) and then used a hole saw drill bit to drill out the bulk of the waste. From there, we repeated the same process with the drum sanding bit to get the fit we wanted.\nThe Tiki Torch is tapered so the holes aren't exactly the same size, this is why we took our time to sand them to a perfect fit. Another way to add variance to a bunch of different torches is the height on which the skull is on the torch.

Very easy thing to add and it gives it a lot more character.\nLastly, the jaw piece has two small tabs that no longer fit because of the placement of the skull so those had to be cut off with scissors and then we hot glued the jaw back in place.\nThese torches are made to be stuck into the ground so from there it was a simple task of putting them in the ground and lighting them up!\nThanks for reading!

In doing so, we were losing a roommate who had supplied our dining table for the past two years, and were looking for something that would better fit our style. Being an engineer (and due to my personality in general), I decided it would be worthwhile to build our own dining table. The overall process is fairly straightforward, and I think anyone can follow along and adapt the design to fit their own space and style. It's definitely a good feeling sitting down for dinners knowing you're using something you first designed and then brought to fruition yourself. In the end, I believe the table materials (lumber + hardware + stains and polycrylic) only cost me around $125 which is extremely low considering the next closest option (of the Swedish variety) would have been around $200 minimum.\nSide note: If you enjoy this Instructable then feel free to vote for me in the Furniture contest!", "title": "Easy and Simple Dining Table", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Easy-and-Simple-Dining-Table/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Keep in mind that we in the Bay Area, CA, so for that reason I wanted something that could be built within a limited space (namely on our ~5' x 17' balcony) and was feasible with my limited tools. For this reason, the design is fairly simple and doesn't feature complex joinery or woodworking methods. Ideally this makes it pretty easy for anyone to create while still making a finished product that impresses all house guests and should stand up to the tests of time.\nThe design itself borrows elements from a farmhouse style table. I spent many hours looking over images of tables on the internet, along with what was available in stores for inspiration. Naturally I wasn't the first one to have the idea to make my own table, and many other creators have posted their process to YouTube which I also found to be a great resource for the overall design and techniques used (see links below).\nThe main things to consider are the height of the table and how many people you want it to fit. There were only going to be three of us using it regularly, but we like to have the occasional game night so wanted the potential for more than that to sit comfortably. In our case, we already had three chairs so I looked to see what the optimum table height would be and how many chairs we could put between the legs. In the end, the table is 28.5\" tall with a 38.5\" x 47.75\" surface. In its normal configuration, we have a chair on three of the four sides with a small bench on the final side. For some occasions, we're actually able to move the chairs to straddle the legs and can squeeze in four extra people fairly comfortably (compared to the normal four it sits).

I initially wanted to use 2x10's glued together to form the top, however, the wood I picked out ended up being too bowed / curved / a number of other problems, so I had to scrap these and use pre-glued project panels. In order to make the 2x10's work, I suggest using a planar / jointer / table saw to make the boards flat and edges as straight as possible to ensure a successful glue up (see link below for some good videos on how to do this correctly). The project panels already have this done to them, so it eliminated all the gaps and imperfections I was seeing in my initial attempt.

Some of the pieces are close in length, so it's helpful to label them to make it easier later on. In addition to the cuts, you'll need to drill holes in some of the pieces for the dowels. I like to use my 3D printer to make jigs to help with consistency, however the same holes can be made using a cardboard template or just measuring the locations. In this case, the jigs helped to make sure the holes were always centered in the posts and in the correct spots at the end of the different 2x4's.\nIt's easiest to drill all the pocket holes before you put anything together. I initially planned on using another 3D printed jig for these pocket holes, but ended up just buying a Kreg jig (I definitely recommend this and think it's worth the money). It's also helpful to load in the pocket hole screws ahead of time to avoid trying to fit the drill in tight spaces during assembly.\nOnce all the pocket holes are drilled, glue in dowels to the holes holes mentioned above. Only glue in one side of the dowel since a dry fit will be performed (the other side of the dowel can be glued at final assembly but isn't necessary).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8X/5QXV/JN4VEKPH/F8X5QXVJN4VEKPH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNZ/3ORE/JN4VEKQ0/FNZ3OREJN4VEKQ0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6L/6NVT/JN4VEUGP/F6L6NVTJN4VEUGP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC5/TBIQ/JN4VEUIR/FC5TBIQJN4VEUIR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F59/J8CP/JN4VD7JO/F59J8CPJN4VD7JO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVM/1GBS/JN4VD7JP/FVM1GBSJN4VD7JP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIO/2PEM/JN4VD7JT/FIO2PEMJN4VD7JT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1M/JL0S/JN4VD7JU/F1MJL0SJN4VD7JU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6Z/WACD/JN4VD7HO/F6ZWACDJN4VD7HO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMM/6BX9/JN4VD7KA/FMM6BX9JN4VD7KA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIV/42D2/JN4VD7KB/FIV42D2JN4VD7KB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYI/YFZB/JN4VD7KD/FYIYFZBJN4VD7KD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBR/K4FH/JN4VD7KH/FBRK4FHJN4VD7KH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7R/RRSN/JN4VD7KF/F7RRRSNJN4VD7KF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR3/AT6T/JN4VD7KG/FR3AT6TJN4VD7KG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F38/8DZV/JN4VD7KE/F388DZVJN4VD7KE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHJ/KGQV/JN4VD7KK/FHJKGQVJN4VD7KK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGV/HQXK/JN4VD7KC/FGVHQXKJN4VD7KC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Prepare the Stock Lumber"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The legs should be assembled using the dowels to guide them into place.

This is very important, especially for attaching the top of the table to the legs. If just screws are used, the top surface is at risk of adjusting over time and will split with the wood movement. To avoid this, special table top fasteners are used with slots that will allow the fasteners to slide with the wood over time (see links below for some further information on this).\nA trim router can be used with a 1/8\" bit to put a slot around the inside edge of the apron. Then use the fastener to make sure the depth is correct (the fastener should fit about halfway into the slot). Next center the top on the leg assembly and clamp it down to avoid any movement. Then screw several fasteners into place to secure the top (I used two to three per edge). Double check the top is secure and add more fasteners as necessary.\nI also had some leftover 2 x 4's, so I chose to put some angle braces in each corner to help keep the table base square. This step is also not completely necessary, but helps add to the durability of the table.\nReferences:\nAllowing For Wood Expansion on Solid Wood Tops by WoodWorkers Guild of America\nHow to Attach a Table Top by The Homestead Craftsman\nQuick Tip: Assembling your Table Top to the base and Aligning by Peter Dettorre\nTabletop Wood Movement Explained by Patrick Hosey", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOC/FX4B/JN4VEKW5/FOCFX4BJN4VEKW5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9R/7B9W/JN4VEKWZ/F9R7B9WJN4VEKWZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWK/B087/JN4VD7IQ/FWKB087JN4VD7IQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7S/E9R1/JN4VD7IR/F7SE9R1JN4VD7IR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRQ/FYJS/JN4VD7IW/FRQFYJSJN4VD7IW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWU/0ESF/JN4VD7J0/FWU0ESFJN4VD7J0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA5/T2UB/JN4VD7IT/FA5T2UBJN4VD7IT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR6/BC3T/JN4VD7IU/FR6BC3TJN4VD7IU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV2/4CQ3/JN4VD7HX/FV24CQ3JN4VD7HX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Put It Together"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Once everything fits together smoothly the next step is to prepare it to be finished. First sand everything down with increasing grits (I started at 80 and went to about 220). Not all surfaces need such a high grit so use your best judgement to determine when sanding is complete. I spent awhile on the top to make sure it was nice and smooth to make sure it was flat and smooth. I also added a small round over using my router along the edge of the top to break the hard corner and make it more comfortable to lean on.\nOnce sanding is done, wipe everything down to make sure all excess dust is gone before staining everything. This is one of my favorite steps since we get to customize the piece and make it something that'll fit in it's final place. Since we already had some Ebony chairs, we chose to stain the legs of the table to match. The top was then stained Fruitwood since we thought it would lighten up the piece and contrast the dark legs. One thing to note (probably obvious to most people) is to make sure you shake the can of stain well to get the pigment all mixed in. The first few coats we did were fairly watery since we forgot to do this so we initially didn't get the results we expected. We then applied a second coat or two until we had a color we liked and everything was well covered.\nAfter finishing staining you'll want to protect everything with a coat or two of polycrylic. We chose a water based product as the oil based ones are reported to add a slight yellow tint to the wood. In the end, this coating should seal the wood to help it last in addition to protect it from any water or heat damage it might see when being used on a daily basis. So far it's held up fairly well, but if the coating starts to degrade then we can just add another coat on.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FU7/YIZE/JN4VD7HY/FU7YIZEJN4VD7HY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR5/FHT2/JN4VD7J8/FR5FHT2JN4VD7J8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0H/BDUB/JN4VD7J7/F0HBDUBJN4VD7J7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHY/VRDW/JN4VD7JA/FHYVRDWJN4VD7JA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Add a Finish"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "If you made it this far then you're done!

Since they are leftover pieces from my previous wardrobe build and it is quite easy to work want to these sheets on to my table saw that's why I prefer that. To cut the thin sheets safely it is good to place some spacer onto the table surface so that the material will not slide underneath the fence because that might be dangerous and throw the piece towards your face.

Thermal shock is caused by uneven expansion and contraction and if there is a fault in the glass like a hairline crack, or in this case, a scored line, it will cleave along that fault.\nI modified my jig by putting a 1/8 inch piece of board on the bottom to raise the bottle up so that the cutting head was at the midway point of the bottle. Then I taped some veneer (about 1/16 inch) at the back so that the bottle would be stable and perpendicular to the cutting wheel.\nI can't emphasize enough how important it is to get ONE clean score around the bottle. The scoring needs to be continuous and most important must begin and end at the same point. In my opinion this cannot be done by hand. At least I can't do it. If the start and end points don't meet when the bottle is heated or separated it's going to cleave longitudinally, down the bottle, ruining the project.\nIn this build, I used a candle flame to heat the bottle. I had been using a butane torch but the flame was so hot a couple of bottles cracked outright. Candles are slower and you will need to heat and ice more times but at least this time it seemed to cleave in the right place. Also, the candle left some soot but I expect that to wash away over time.\nRepeatedly heat the bottle right at or above the score line for about 30 seconds, turning constantly. Then dunk it ice water. Do this until you hear a distinct crack in the ice water. You might be tempted to hit the top of the bottle. That works more times than not but it also results in more rejects. Be patient. It will happen.\nWhen you finally cleave the top off there is going to be some jagged edges.

I sand the outside and inside lips by tilting the glass.\nI hold the glass for no more than about 20 seconds at a time because I don't want the glass to get hot enough from friction to induce more thermal shock.\nI then work thru the grades of sandpaper I have. By 220 grit it is already smooth enough to run my finger over.\nI finish polishing it with wet-dry sandpaper stuck with water to a piece of glass. Today all I had was 330 grit but often I go up to 1000. This creates a smooth polished surface similar to commercial drinking glasses.\nI finally wrap a strip of 330 grit wet dry paper around a 3/4 inch dowel and use that to really polish the inside lip and the rest of the glass top.\nFinally, the lip test. After I've sanded it all, visually inspected it, Run my finger over it and then used a piece of cotton ball around the rim to make sure nothing snags I wash and dry the glass and then run it over my lip both on the inside and outside rims. Again, I figure that if I'm going to drink from it or give it away then I'm going to be my own test subject.\nI hope you enjoy this Instructable and I welcome your comments and questions. This is a fun project and I've received more requests for this project from friends and family than anything else. I also think I use more caution with this project than with any other.

Well hockey is popular and I have 2 boys who are into competitive hockey now. When they were younger in IP5, (initiation program age 5) they would practice once a week and play once a week. Not too often and given lots of time to dry equipment between uses. Also at 5 years of age they don't really sweat and even if they do, it's not stinky. Fast forward to them now, ages 11 and 12 and playing competitive hockey, it means at least 2-3 practices and 1-2 games a week, plus well body odor is becoming a problem. I as a single dad, often have to deal also with the boys who have to bring their equipment bags to their mom's home every other week so there's a lot of back and forth and I can't keep track of their equipment drying at the other house. We both live in smaller homes with very narrow entrances making air drying a huge messy clutter problem and guess what's easier than spreading the equipment out to dry out in the hallway? You got it. The stinky equipment stays in the bag and that's where the bacteria grows to cause all that stink. I don't subscribe to the theory that the smell that wants me to vomit my stomach contents every time a hockey player walks by with their equipment on is really the smell of \"winning!\" Don't fall into the trap that stinky hockey equipment is the norm. I can't stand it and I don't want my boys to be ok with wearing smelly equipment. Don't get me wrong, it can have some smell, just it shouldn't want to make you puke that's all. So back when my boys were small I modified a clothes hanger that basically hang off their standing hockey bag on wheels. I basically just added some string and clips so that their jersey and gloves and pants could hang off and it didn't take up any more space than the hockey bag. Today however, their equipment is bigger and they sweat more and play more so a small hanger wouldn't do, plus they have the big hockey bags they carry over their shoulder so they basically flop on the floor. I've tried hockey equipment \"trees\" but they were cumbersome, took up a lot of space in the hallway and were prone to tipping over if you looked at them wrong. Since the hallway is narrow in both homes, I needed a solution that was basically able to keep the equipment off the floor, take minimal hallway space and most of all, easy enough for the boys to air dry their equipment without frustration, because we all know how that goes, especially after a loss. Bonus point too is that this equipment hanger goes with their equipment in the bag, from house to house and even to hotels on away tournaments!!

For the full background, if you haven't read it, see the Instructable for an overview of what we do. Its not necessary but it may provide some context and shares some important lessons learned as we developed our props.\nAdding some talking and singing skeletons has been on the list for years. We weren't content with store bought laughter and blinking red led eyes. (Although we did buy one and take it apart). We needed something that fit the theme and was a home-built project. Meet Vinnie. He is the prototype and basis for our future skulls and skeletons.\nVincent or Mr. Price is probably a more appropriate way of addressing him but Vinnie is easier. This prop is a recording of Vincent Price reading Edgar Allen Poe's \"The Raven\". Its about a 2 1/2 minute MP3 file that is processed live; there are no pre-programmed or scripted movements of the skull. As the file plays, the sound is processed and converted into appropriate movements of the skull's jaw. The better part of it is that the program starts with a default range of motion and records highs and lows the first time the file plays. It then re-calibrates the best range of motion for the file and loops 2 and on have a better accuracy and representation. Is he perfect? No, but he is hitting believable and appropriate motion at 90% or better.\nIn addition to the famous poem, Vincent Price did a movie of the same title in the 60s so that linked it nicely to the overall theme. More importantly, there is minimal background effects on this clip which allowed the sound processor to react mainly to his spoken voice. Key to any related implementation is clear vocals without background music or effects. Don't expect lip syncing to a song; there is no way to differentiate the music and voice. To the processor, its just something in the frequency band. The second video is a live radio broadcast of the Nationals at Cubs on August 12 2018. There is a little more flutter from the crowd noise and it needs some tweaking to improve, but still a pretty good effect overall.\nWe stared by building our own band pass filter to zero in on the voice range and then found a chip (of course) which had seven filters on it so we could work on seven different ranges. Then we found a board which implemented the chip and voila.\nThe basic theory here is that the spoken voice will fall in a predictable range of frequency. Deeper voices like Vincent Price in lower ranges and higher voices in higher frequencies. Of the seven ranges (there is overlap - see the spec sheet if interested) roughly four have significant voice activity. We ran the file through many times to see where the activity was. The sound processor returns 14 voltages (7 bands x left and right stereo) and we map that to a servo angle which opens and closes the jaw. We added some code to make the movement appear more natural and reduce flutter. The sound can be processed much faster than the servo can get to position so we slowed the sampling down again for a more natural look.

What we wanted to do was have a bottom lighting effect that turned on and off when Vinnie was speaking. We opted instead to just keep him illuminated at all times while he sits in his chair. We kept the code but stopped connecting a lamp to the Arduino with no ill effects.\nKISS was the over-riding protocol on this one. For spot illumination, we use cheap LED headlamps. They can be bought in 3 packs for about 9 dollars. Some are multicolor, we went with a Home Depot Defiant version that is white only. For constant illumination, just turn them on to the mode you want, position, and walk away. They all even come with batteries.\nThey all pretty much work on the same principal; as you press the On/Off button, it causes the interior circuit to drop to ground which cycles it to the next mode. Ours has 3 modes (center light, outside lights, and all lights on) so 4 presses of the button cycles from Off through the 3 lit modes and back to off.\nDepending on what you use, the specifics will vary but the principal is the same. Open the back panel to get to the battery compartment. Remove the batteries. Under the batteries are small screws which hold the battery compartment to the frame. Remove the battery holder and you should see the circuit board. You'll the trace lines that connect to ground and to the blob IC that controls the lamp.\nIn order to control the button press process with an Arduino, simply solder a wire to one side of the button and connect this to a digital pin on the Arduino. (We had to remove the small rubber button cover and ran our wires through that gap). The other side of the button is ground and gets connected to ground on the Arduino. Simulate pressing the button by cycling the connected pin to ground and its done. If you end up with a single mode light, there is no issue; cycle to ground turns it on and off. With multiple modes, you need to tell it how many to times to push it to get to the mode you want. Depending on the mode you chose then determines the number of times to press the button to cycle to off. That's what the lite_On and lite_Off code handles.\nTotally optional but its a handy trick to have available. TIP: As the batteries weaken, the cycle performance drops off.

The code has default mappings for what constitutes a fully open jaw and a fully closed. Lots of variables affect how well they work. So first time through a sound clip, it records highs and lows and re-scales the mapping with iteration two and on. This presupposes a single file is running or that multiple files have similar sound characteristics.\nThe code can execute and the sound processor can run much faster than the servo can adjust. Too fast and the jaw will simply shake open and closed slightly as it gets new commands before it has reached a target setting. If you need to adjust the degree settings, do it gradually and test. The jaw can move from fully open to fully closed in about 90 degrees of servo rotation.

Unfortunately, my car would still require me to cut this down into at least 3 sections to fit it in, and while delivery was possible, the cost or minimum order quantity made it unfeasible.\nTo keep the costs down by transporting them myself, I re-imagined it as a wooden slat style mounting rack, which opened the possibilities to using old decking, floorboards and even dismantled shipping pallets.\nThese can even be found for free, if not very low prices on sites like Facebook marketplace or Gumtree, as long as they are structurally sound and not riddled with woodworm!

Even the slats that I'd cut in half to help fit the pallets in my car looked great when added to the array.\nTo round off all the edges, and smooth any rough slats I used a sanding disk on my angle grinder. The whole process only took around 15 minutes.\nIn order to create a gap behind the slats, I measured out 4 lengths of 3x1 timber to match the height of the wall, then cut each into 3 equal pieces, resulting in 12 lengths of 78cm.

If you lift the piece of wood a little, you have a small hole in between the jute twines where you can tie off one end of the twine.

It\u2019ll also house some spare parts like batteries and spare lights for the glowing eyes, some jute twine, some garbagebag twisters, some tie-rips and maybe some contact adhesive (and my leatherman will be on my belt! preparation is half the game!).\nIt will also act as my \u201ctrophy-bag o eyeballs\u201d to fit the costume.\nSome kind of small pouch\nPlastic eyeballs OR pingpongballs/ stryrofoam balls and sharpy\u2019s (red, blue and black)\nPainters silicone chalk + chalkgun\nRed spraypaint\nBlack paint (shoepolish in my case)\nClear (transparent) nail polish\nSmall brush\nWooden BBQ-skewer\nIron ring (mine is a lamp-makers-ring)\nNeedle\nContact adhesive\nThe eyeballs\nI found a bag of ping-pong like eyeballs which lend themselves perfectly for this prop! But you could simply make these with colored markers (sharpys) on Styrofoam balls or ping-pong balls.\nI tried to droop a lot of hot-glue on one of the eyes first\u2026 I was left with half an eyeball\u2026\nSo painter chalk it is! A big drip on the backside which I spread out using a wooden BBQ-skewer. I didn\u2019t particularly pay attention to anatomy, but most of the \u2018tissue\u2019 should be focused on the back.\nBy dipping in and pulling straight out you can create the thinner, stringy part.\nI stuck them on skewers to let them dry overnight.\nFor a really good fake blood \u2018ible, take a look HERE!\nI tried 3 types of coloring; nailpolish, spraypaint and commercial fake blood spray.\nThe nailpolish worked really well, it dried very fast and it sticks good to the silicone. The color is a bit too bright straight out of the bottle tho. The brush makes for easy and precise \u2018painting\u2019.\nThe spraypaint is a bit messy and its hard to control in such tight spacing. You can see some spray on the plastic balls (which I don\u2019t mind), and 2 eyeballs had drips running to the front. The color is very nice, still to monotone, but not that super-bright like the nailpolish.\nThe fake blood spray didn\u2019t stick to the silicone at all, it intended for skin and clothes.\nAfter adding some black accents to the nailpolish-one and the spraypaint-one, I decided that the spraypaint is the best fit. Note that colors look different in pictures\u2026\nAfter spraying and letting all the eyeballs dry I added some black accents to deepen the look. I used a small make-up brush and black shoepolish. I dipped the brush in the shoepolish, smear it over the high-contours of the painted silicone and the wipe it gently with a dry cloth to get the full black stains off, smearing them out. In the pictures the black is way more obvious as in real life!\nTo give the eyes a wet-look, I cover the whole thing in clear nail polish and let dry!\nThe bag\nI\u2019m using a crappy soviet gasmask bag. I don\u2019t particularly like the green color, so I\u2019ll have to grunge it up! I won\u2019t really rip at this one since it will hold my valuables aswell. After throwing the bag in a bucket with (couple days old) black dye, the worst of the green has come off. Grunging it up will do the last bit into getting it somewhat color-complementary to the costume. I also used a lot of red in this step, housing my \u2018trophy-eyeballs\u2019, its \u201csaturated with blood\u201d.\nI sew in a couple teeth instead of the buttons. A small hole in the canines and jute twine, a single loop knotted on the inside of the bag. Give the loop just a little room, so it will fit the button-loop.\nI also sew in an iron ring, wrapped in some additional cloths, into the opening.

This would be an easy conversion to carry-on lightsource for on the staff (or around the house). I also had a pretty weathered oil lamp at home\u2026 but for my costume it would be a bit to modern, so I decided to make a \u201cmedieval-style\u201d one.\nCandle\nFor the candle I\u2019m going for an electric flickering tealight-candle. I doubt I can bring actual open fire into a party! To give the appearance of a tall(er) candle, I cut a toiletroll at 7cm measured from the top. I cover the outside of the top 1.5cm with hot-glue and really let it droop over the edges. This makes it look like you have candlewax dripping along the sides.\nAbout 2cm on the inside of the rim I glue in an edge for the electric flickering tealight-candle to stand on. I don\u2019t glue it in, it stands on a solidified edge of hot-glue.\nNow take some white spraypaint to it (not the electric flickering tealight-candle) and presto!\nI grunge it up just a little to get the bright-white off it!\nLantern\nThe lantern I made of 3 strips of thick bark (felled from a fallen tree), a tree-ring (diameter of your intended lantern), a piece of leather and a piece of cord. The whole thing is framed with rebar wire (iron coat hangers or thick electric wire would work to), making it more solid (the bark itself isn\u2019t strong enough, I think).\nWire frame;\nI drill 6 small holes in the tree-ring, about 1.5cm in from the edge and fitting to where the edges of the bark are coming. I drill all the way through. Standing up in these bottom-ring-holes are 6 pieces (20cm) of rebar-wire. The bottom centimeter (below the tree-ring) is bent to keep it in place and the tops are connected to a ring (about 40cm of rebar wire). From the ring to the top I create a little roof using 2 pieces of rebar wire (2x about 40cm). This is where the leather will wrap around.\nWalls;\nI cut out 3 strips of bark measuring about 7x15cm. the top and bottom need straight edges and the sides can be a more natural break-line (I punch a flat screwdriver through and then break the bark). By laying a piece up to your tree-ring you can mark off and drill through your tree-ring. When setting a piece of bark upright, I simply bend the tops of rebar-wire over the top of bark with the wire from the top ring in between. Squeeze these tight using a plier and dap some glue and let dry.\nRoof;\nWith a patch of black leather (45x13cm) and a piece of cord we\u2019ll tackle a quick and easy roof. But first create a little roof using 2 pieces (about 40cm) of rebar-wire.\nBend one of the wires in the middle by looping it around a pen or such creating a little loop for hanging the lantern later. With a plier I twisted the wire/ loop making it stronger. Bend your second wire in the middle too and loop it around the twisted part of the other wire.\nShape it like a roof and set it onto the top ring of your lantern. Now you have 4 pieces of rebar-wire sticking out over the sides that need to be looped around the top ring, holding it in place\nThe top edge of the leather patch gets folded together, like an accordion, every couple of centimeters. With a leather working tool (no idea of the name) I poke through all layers, hook in a piece of jute twine and pull it through all the folded layers. The first and last hole are passed through twice with the cord, pulling them together. Scoot it over the wire frame creating a wrinkled, sloping roof.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FA9/5R3B/JMS4WHWG/FA95R3BJMS4WHWG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZV/FSLC/JMS4WJ0L/FZVFSLCJMS4WJ0L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2V/QV8T/JMS4WJ0O/F2VQV8TJMS4WJ0O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDT/R0OV/JMS4X440/FDTR0OVJMS4X440.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5Q/ZWNC/JMS4X441/F5QZWNCJMS4X441.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIA/5IGO/JMS4X442/FIA5IGOJMS4X442.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKS/HT3I/JMS4X447/FKSHT3IJMS4X447.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFC/27OJ/JMS4X445/FFC27OJJMS4X445.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPZ/CXNM/JMS4X446/FPZCXNMJMS4X446.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI8/7NS9/JMS4X449/FI87NS9JMS4X449.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQZ/H4JC/JMS4X44B/FQZH4JCJMS4X44B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUD/6M8A/JMS4X44E/FUD6M8AJMS4X44E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLN/MSBA/JMS4X44F/FLNMSBAJMS4X44F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC6/F4ZO/JMS4X44H/FC6F4ZOJMS4X44H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB9/A0QD/JMS4X459/FB9A0QDJMS4X459.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZW/PP8T/JMS4X45A/FZWPP8TJMS4X45A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXV/O2PX/JMS4X462/FXVO2PXJMS4X462.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA8/J912/JMS4X469/FA8J912JMS4X469.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Medieval Lantern"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "A super easy, but often overlooked decoration piece.

In our case, we have roughly 12\" on the top above the top piece and about 8\" below the bottom piece. This isn't important but it gives it enough room to hammer into the ground enough so it stays up. Once we roughly lay these out, we give them a little bit of angle so it's not perfectly straight across. Each section of fence you build should be a little different when you get to this part.\nWe then use a little bit of glue, outdoor waterproof glue if you can, to glue the pieces together and then use a brad nailer to put 2-3 nails in each corner. If you don't have a brad nailer you can of course use a hammer and nails or a screw works great as well. Don't rely on glue only. Outdoor weather is tough on glue, even the waterproof kind. It's not likely to stay together for very long if you use only glue.\nFor the slats, we arrange them randomly as shown and give each one a little bit of angle. We then glue and nail them the same way. We also make sure the nails aren't poking through the back. If necessary, we nail them in at an angle to avoid them poking out the back.\nLastly, we add some detail! Using some simple brown twine, we tie it to each corner and wrap it around a bunch of times to make it look like they're tied together. Hot glue (optional) helps to secure the twine down. We do this on each corner and make sure to hide any nails or screws with the twine.\nWe then bring it outside and hammer it into the ground.

All the methods I've used require taping the template to the pumpkin to keep it in place as you are working. I sometimes find it helpful to cut the template strategically so that it wraps around the pumpkin better. You could also cut the mouth into a separate piece before taping to the pumpkin.\nOnce taped, you can transfer the image by one of these three methods:\nPlace carbon paper (face down) between the pumpkin and the template. I find it easier to use smaller pieces (rather than a full sheet) and move it around as needed. Use a pencil or serrated tracing wheel to follow around the edges of the template (make sure the carbon paper is under the area you are working on). This will leave a pencil like sketch, of the edges you traced, on the surface of the pumpkin.\nIf you press hard enough you can skip the carbon paper, and just use the serrated tracing wheel. This doesn't work well of craft/foam pumpkins, but could be okay on a real pumpkin.\nYou can use a needle or pin to poke holes through the paper of the template and into the pumpkin. Follow along the edges of the template. You'll want the holes close enough so you can follow along later to cut, sand, or paint the areas as desired. When the paper is removed you will have the outline as a series of dots (kind of like \"connect the dots\".

My design is different than the original design; however, in an abundance of caution--and with a sincere respect for Frank Lloyd Wright's work--I sent photos of the design and lamp to the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. I provided the Foundation the opportunity to express any concerns they might have about my intended design and personal use of the design. For me, my caution went beyond not violating any copyright per se, but I also did not want to inappropriately imitate his work, offend the foundation or dilute the reputation of the Frank Lloyd Wright non-profit foundation.

You may be surprised to learn that laser cutters are actually fairly common, and you're very likely to within driving distance of a public laser cutter, which you can use for little or no expense. The laser cutter I used belonged to a local makerspace (Tinkermill in Longmont, CO). Your local library might even have a laser cutter available for use. You can start your search for a local MakerSpace using this map.\nOnce you have the .DXF file, the laser cutting process is easy and automatic. In my case, I just had to be careful that the laser didn't start a fire. I used 5mm (1/4 inch) birch plywood available from the Home Depot for about $14. Lowe's offers a similar product; however, in my experience, the material from Home Depot is higher quality and cuts cleaner. The material from Lowe's seems to have more glue and ignite on fire more.\nObviously, you want to be sure that you're operating safely within your laser cutter's operating capacity.

We want it to be cold and sink down so we pump the fog into a container filled with ice. The fog goes into the container towards the top and then has to sink down through the cold ice to come out of the bottom.

This hole should be the same diameter as the PVC pipe you're using. If you don't have a drill bit that big, you can also carefully cut it out with a razor blade.\nRoughly halfway up the container, we then made 8 marks. 3 on each long end and 1 on each short end. With a small drill bit we drilled a pilot hole through the container on each of these marks.\nWe then used a small screw and a washer, with a dab of silicone and screwed it all the way in from the outside. If you don't have silicone you can also use super glue. We want it to be air tight.

A fix that many people go with is simply getting rid of the old piece of furniture and then buying a newer, more stylish one. This is easy and inexpensive for some people, but for those of us who are trying to save money wherever possible, you can't just go buy and new one. So what are we to do if we are stuck with an old unstylish piece of furniture - fix it up of course! I hope to make doing so seem more possible.\nLast summer a friend of mine, who knows I collect wood, gave me an old worn out coffee table with scratched out stain marks. How I will fix it up is by sanding the top so it's much brighter and more wood looking, and will paint the everything but the top white, putting a coat of tung oil on the top, and repaint the old drawer knobs.

The reason for this is that the majority of people might be not-so-good with arduinos and their coding (like myself!) and in my opinion, it's always best to get the hardest things done first.\nLucky for you, I already have an arduino sketch for you to use! Of course, you are free and welcomed to edit it, and give it some style of your own!\nThe sketch is attached to this page. If you're already good with arduino-stuff, just get the sketch and you know what to do already, so DO IT. However, if you're new to arduino, and/or are buying an arduino for the first time in order to build this decoration, keep reading below:\nYou need the arduino IDE:https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software Click on your operating system, listed in the turquoise box, to download the installer.\nAfter you have the program installed, open the program from the directory which you installed it in. In the IDE, at the top click Tools. Look at \"port:\" and take note of what ports it lists.\nPlug in your arduino through the USB port. Let windows do it's thing (your computer will auto install drivers).\nIn the IDE, at the top, click Tools. Look at the ports again now. The arduino is whichever port didn't appear the first time you checked. Make sure it's selected now.\nUnder Tools, make sure \"Board:\" is set to the correct board that you have.\nNow you can finally open the sketch file that I made. Hit \"Ctrl+O\" and locate the sketch file and open it. Click the checkmark button to verify the sketch, then click the right-arrow button next to it, to upload the sketch to the arduino. Now your arduino is running the Loop!\nIt's a good Idea now to build a mock-up circuit on a breadboard to confirm that everything is working, and that you know how to wire the circuits.\nIn the photos here, I have two examples. One of them shows how each \"channel\" is connected to the board for the sketch I have uploaded (which is set-up for 6 pairs of eyes) but it only has a single LED and resistor on each channel.The other image shows only one channel connected, but it shows the proper wiring for two LEDs in parallel. That (in parallel) is how they will be wired up in the final steps, because you want one LED for each eye.\nLet's talk about how to choose resistors.\nThe arduino will output a signal that is 5 Volts higher than ground, so that means positive 5 Volts relative to ground. That's the first important thing to know. Then you need a Datasheet for your LEDs; we want to know the current-limit rating of the LED; most are about 20 to 30 milliAmps, so we can try to limit our current to 20 mA, aka, 0.020 Ampere. You also need to know the voltage drop (aka, \"Vf\" forward voltage) across the diode. You can either measure this with a multimeter, or read it in the datasheet.\nLet's pretend that our voltage drop across the diode is 2 Volts. When you apply 5 Volts to it, there is still 3V leftover to run rampant with current and blow up the LED! So we need to lower this voltage just a little more... by 3 volts exactly! So, we know how much current we want AND we know how much voltage is leftover to kill. This is where OHM'S LAW comes into play! V=I*R (Voltage=Current*Resistance). We know V and we know I, so just solve for R. So now that you algebra'd a little bit, we have V/I=R. 3/(0.02)= 150 Ohms.\nThat was just an example, but 200 Ohms will work for most LEDs. If you'd like to learn more in depth about selecting resistors for your LEDs, visit this tutorial: https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/219\nIts important for me to mention, that it doesn't matter whether the resistor is in front or back of the LED, but the LED must be in the correct orientation for it to light up (because it's a diode). Of the two LED leads, there is a long leg, and a shorter leg. The long leg is the \"+ side\" which goes to the digital signal output. The shorter leg is the \"- side\" (ground) and goes to the ground pin of the arduino.\nWe will wire-up everything for real, in a later step.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLD/NB2C/JMAUZQN1/FLDNB2CJMAUZQN1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAS/K2MB/JMAUZQN0/FASK2MBJMAUZQN0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Arduino!"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "So Now is a good time to 3D print the eyes.

I learned so much about working with foam-board from Flite Test, I highly recommend watching one of their build videos. (This is a good one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2hjmvyRFwUJust watch the first few minutes, to see how he handles and glues the foamboard, because it\u2019s the same method you\u2019ll use here, but be aware the fold he makes is specifically an \"A-fold\")\nIf you have ever built a Flite Test airplane before, you may be familiar with the cuts and types of folds, A-folds and B-folds. However, most people are not familiar with those, so I will need to explain this very carefully.\nHopefully you can tell how to fold it from looking at my pictures, but here goes nothin\u2019\u2026\nThe lowercase \u201ct\u201d shape, is the part you will cut out from a larger piece of foamboard. That t-shape is made up of 6 separate rectangular sections, in-between each of which, there are 2 score-cuts that must be made. A score-cut is when you don\u2019t cut all-the-way through the material. Essentially, you want to cut through the top paper-layer and into only a portion of the foam, but you MUST preserve the bottom layer of paper. Each of the 2 score-cuts divides the foam, so that when you bend the joint like a hinge, it will release a long, skinny strip of foamboard. You need to remove the long strips of foam from between the edges of all the rectangles, by bending each joint back, and wiggling the strip out until it\u2019s free (The video I linked shows how to do that). Those skinny strips you remove, correspond to the cross-hatched pattern in the PDF template.\nBefore we move on from here, go ahead and use the 3D-printed eyes as a template to cut out the holes that they\u2019ll be fitting in to. Just hold the eye flat down to the foamboard, and trace around the eye with a very sharp pencil. Then, use your hobby knife to cut out this shape, very carefully. It\u2019s better to cut slightly inside the lines rather than outside the lines. Then go ahead and give the eyes a test-fit if you\u2019d like, but don\u2019t glue them in yet.\nThe central rectangular section of foamboard, the face where the eyes go through, I will refer to as the \"centerpiece\". The upper and lower rectangles (the same size as the centerpiece) I will call them \"roof and floor\" for reference. Take the foamboard \u201ct\u201d shape and lay it onto a flat surface such as a tabletop. Keeping the centerpiece flat against the table, you\u2019re going to fold up the roof and floor, so that their inner-edges of paper are beside the foam edges of the centerpiece. The roof and floor foam edges should be flat against the bottom-layer of paper, and firmly pressed against the table. This is called a B-fold; \u2018B\u2019 stands for \u201cbeside\u201d.\nThe sides, the two square pieces on either side of the centerpiece, will be folded up next. Notice how the sides fit perfectly between the roof and floor pieces. When the sides fold up, they will be above of the centerpiece, and their bottom foam-edges will be in contact with the top layer of paper of the centerpiece. This is called an A-fold. \u2018A\u2019 stands for \u201cabove\u201d.\nMake sure you practice and familiarize yourself with these folds BEFORE you put any hot-glue in the joints.\nWhen you\u2019re finally confident that you know how to make the fold, then, put a bead of hot glue along the entire length of the edge and make the fold, while remaining diligent to ensure that you hold it at exactly a 90-degree angle. Glue no more than 2 edges at a time to ensure that everything is staying nice and perpendicular. Keep holding it for at least 10-15 seconds to ensure it cools enough before you let go.\nAfter those 4 sides are glued, you\u2019re left with a nice hinged-door that fits perfectly on the back. Don\u2019t glue this door down yet.\nInsert the eyes into the holes, to where they are nearly flush, but just sticking out a little bit. On the inside of the box, place a hearty amount of hot glue around the perimeter of the eyes to fully secure them and seal up any gaps that may exist. Give it several minutes to fully cool down. You should then also apply a thin bead of hot glue around the perimeter of the eyes on the front side of box as well.\nNow that the eyes are done, we can move on to installing the LED lights inside the box.\nYou simply need to poke the LED leads through the foamboard door, directly behind the location of the eye. Once that is done, put some hot glue around the LED bulbs to secure them in place. Add some reinforcement hot-glue along the inner edges of the foamboard, and now, you can finally seal the door shut with some hot glue around every edge and joint of the box. This will add a lot of strength to the box, and will aid in its resistance to weathering.\nGet your soldering-stuff ready. Solder one resistor to each LED. Then solder the free-ends of the resistors together, and solder the the remaining LED leads together. Make sure that LEDs are facing the same way, so that you are soldering the same leads together; i.e., negative with negative, and positive with positive. Use the photos for reference.\nThen, you should solder some short wires to the leads here, so that when you're making the full-length wire connections out in the yard, you only need to connect wire-to-wire. If you're using magnet-wire like I am, then you must use sandpaper, or a knife to scrape-off the insulation at the ends of the wire, before you can solder it.\nYou can then seal-up the exposed solder connections and resistors on the back of the box, using hot-glue.\nTo fully waterproof the box, fully wrap the box in either packaging-tape, or duct tape. If you use duct tape, you will need to cut around the eyes to expose them.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FT3/SHXM/JM8ACQN8/FT3SHXMJM8ACQN8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQM/NHQI/JM8ACQMC/FQMNHQIJM8ACQMC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXF/WDA7/JM8ACQMD/FXFWDA7JM8ACQMD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6H/V9N8/JM8ACQME/F6HV9N8JM8ACQME.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHU/8U19/JM8ACQN5/FHU8U19JM8ACQN5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F03/18DH/JMAV0H4V/F0318DHJMAV0H4V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC7/VWS3/JMAV3CWE/FC7VWS3JMAV3CWE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGC/5D8D/JMAV0H4T/FGC5D8DJMAV0H4T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWF/UKVD/JM8ACQNA/FWFUKVDJM8ACQNA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Make the Foamboard Eye-Boxes, Add Eyes and LEDs, Then Seal It Up"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Get some sort of enclosure box ready for the arduino to go inside of. I used a plastic ammo box that my brother threw in the trash. Make sure the arduino fits inside, alongside anything else you may have with the arduino. Inside my box, I also included a mini-breadboard, and I also made a common-ground rail because the mini-breadboard did not have power-rails. The power-supply cable for the arduino enters the box through a hole I made in the side. The wires for all of the eyes just enter the box through the top, and I simply just left the lid open slightly. Place the arduino box somewhere that it can stay dry, but you also want it as close to the eyes as possible.\nPut some thought into where you want to place the eyes in your yard. You'll want a nice and dark place so that trick-or-treaters can't see that it's \"just a box with eyes\". My preference is for putting them in bushes.\nWhen you know where you want them to go, secure them to a stem or branch of the foliage, with a zip-tie around the box, between the eyes.\nThis next part, I apologize, is slightly painstaking, but it shouldn't take too long.\nWe need to route the wires from the arduino, through the yard, to each set of eyes. Do this during the daytime, while the sun is still out.\n1.) Start by taking one end of wire from your spool of wire, and tape it down securely, right next to the arduino-box, but make sure that you have plenty of slack for that wire to reach inside the arduino box to be plugged-in later. Once that end is secured, while holding the spool, carefully walk to the location of the eyes, letting the wire unspool as you move along. When you're at the eye-box, make sure the wire is not being pulled tight, and has plenty of slack leftover to move the wire around (so that you can neatly tuck-it under bushes and out of any walkways) then, snip the wire with enough length to be connected to the eye-box wires. Remove the wire insulation, and either solder them or twist them together to make the connection (I went with twisting them). You need to wrap some tape over the connection, so that it never comes into contact with the other wire's connection.\n2.) For the other wire, make the wire-connection while you're still standing next to the eye-box, and carefully walk back to the arduino-box, allowing the wire to unspool as you move along. Make sure you keep the wires associated with each other, so that you can keep track of which pairs of wires are for which eyes. Once you've made it back to the arduino box, snip the wire, leaving enough slack to reach inside the box.\nYou can now test it out by plugging in the wires to the breadboard/arduino (remove the insulation first) and turning on the power to the arduino. Don't worry if you mix up the two wires, you can just reverse them if you don't see the eyes light up. Once you're satisfied that it is working, go ahead and repeat parts 1.) and 2.) for however many eye-boxes that you made.\nOnce all the eyes are wired-up in your yard, and you're plugging them into the breadboard, make sure that there's no exposed-wire (where you removed the insulation) that is touching other exposed wires.\nIf the wires need to pass over a walkway, use plenty of duct tape to tape the wire down against the floor, so that you remove the liability of people tripping over it. ;)\nPlug the the arduino power supply into your wall-plug timer, and set the times that you want it to turn on and off at night.\nThat's it.

That means I would only need to route a single power cable to each arduino, and no dealing with the mess of magnet wire.\nOther considerations of mine include:\nAdding actual connectors to the wires to make making-connections a breeze.\nUsing stranded-copper wires instead of solid-core magnet wire, to make the wires more flexible, and last longer.\nBuying wire that is sold already spooled as a pair of wires, to reduce the amount of walking back-and-forth. I have considered using cat6 ethernet cabling; if you split open the outer jacket, you get 4 pairs of stranded wire, already twisted together.\nRemember to use your ingenuity, to make up for my lack thereof!

I pounded out the bent bolt and drilled new holes in the gussets to match the existing hole in the 4x4 and put in a new bolt. The new gusset holes are maybe 27\" apart instead of 28\", to fit the new angle between the 4x4s. It is less than 135 degrees (twice the 67.5 miter) because the 4x4s are bowing inward.\nSome wall 4x4s were obviously bowed, and one was partly cracked. I added a second 4x4 to the bending ones.\nIn one case (photo 1) I pushed hard on the east wall to shift as much load as possible from the original 4x4 to the reinforcements. Here I am testing my escape route before I expand the hydraulic jack behind my left knee. It is backed up with 2 axle stands, all lifting a 6x6 timber anchored against the opposite wall.

Otherwise, I hope you enjoy it as is!\nFor a couple of years my wife and I lived in a small townhouse/duplex in Southern California with no yard and a back patio that was perpetually in the shade.\nI'd always wanted to try growing my own food, and I felt like because I finally had my \"own place,\" it would give me a good opportunity... but I had no space.\nOne night I started brainstorming about whether or not I could start a raised bed on the back patio with shade-friendly plants. It turns out most plants like light. A lot.\nAfter that I thought about contacting our homeowners association and seeing if they'd be ok with me using some of the public space to start a garden... maybe even a community garden. The HOA decided it would detract from the aesthetic appeal of the property. Furthermore, because I was a renter, I didn't have much say in what the HOA said I could or couldn't do.\nFast forward a couple of weeks, and a random thought occurred to me late one night. I had a Toyota Tacoma that I bought with money from a deployment (rookie mistake, but what's done is done), and which I had used as a truck all of maybe 5 times in the 3 years I had owned it. It was a fun truck to drive, but it wasn't getting used as a truck.\nThe pieces started falling into place. I decided I would try to make a mobile farm/garden in my truck bed! As I researched it that night, I found others who had attempted it as well, which validated the idea. I used some of their designs as a baseline and got started.", "title": "Truck Farm: a Mobile Educational Garden Experiment", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Truck-Farm-a-Mobile-Educational-Garden-Experiment/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I hadn't ever built... well... anything, before. I had no woodworking experience. No gardening experience. No electronics experience. I had training as a Marine, which served me very well for \"Marine things,\" but left me unprepared for projects like this. Luckily necessity is the mother of invention, and I needed a garden at this point!\nSo first things first, I decided to set my goals and overall expectations of where I wanted the project to be when complete.\nBe Mobile. Being mobile would allow me to get around the barrier of not having any sunlight. In fact, I would be able to move my truck as needed to be in the sun all the time this way!\nBe Lightweight. My truck was a Toyota Tacoma which is on a SUV chassis (or so I'm told) and not built for 1-ton+ loads as far as I know. I would need the garden to be comparatively lightweight if I would want it to last. More on this later.\nLook Cool. I figured if I was going to do something as crazy as drive around with a greenhouse/garden in the back of my truck, I'd at least want it to look good and professional\nWithstand Freeway Speeds. This was a very important goal. I didn't do any studies on drag or wind resistance (maybe I should have). Being in SoCal, much of my driving would occur on the freeway. I would need the garden to be secure enough that I wouldn't lose plants/pieces.\nBe Functional. I'd actually want to GROW STUFF in this garden. I had hoped to provide all, or most of my wife and my produce needs through my truck farm, which would help us save money at the grocery store.\nBe Educational. I wanted to be able to use the truck farm as a means of educating other people interested in learning about growing their own food. Moreover, I wanted to learn something myself. I chose to incorporate automated watering, temperature sensors and cooling systems in order to give myself some experience in Arduino and electronics.\nWith my list of goals more or less complete, I went to the drawing board.\nMATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT NEEDED FOR THE GREENHOUSE:\nFraming Wood. I built the frame out of 1x2 redwood. It is more expensive than standard pine, but is much more resistant to moisture and rot, which would be important or this project.\nSiding Wood. Siding was cheap plywood or OSB. Do not use straight particle board or MDF, as they do not withstand moisture well at all, and will crumble over time.\nAcrylic or Polycarbonate Sheets. You have a couple of options for the \"glass\" of the greenhouse. Plexiglas is a brand name of acrylic sheets. You're probably best looking in a big Blue or Orange store, but if Amazon is your game, I recommend optix acrylic sheets. The thickness is up to your preference; you want it to be thick enough to be durable, but not so thick as to be too heavy. Alternatively, if you have a little more money to spend, I would recommend Lexan polycarbonate sheets. Lexan is the brand name, but polycarbonate is typically much more durable than acrylic, and also slightly more resistant to sun damage over longer periods of time. Both acrylic and polycarbonate are durable and effective, it just depends on your budget.\nEPDM Pond Liner. I bought this Firestone EPDM pond liner because I'd heard that Firestone PondGard was the best pond liner available. It was slightly expensive and probably overkill, but I knew that there would be no chemicals leaching from it into my soil. Don't get PVC for that reason. And between HDPE and EPDM, I've heard a lot of debate.\nDrainage Mat. The drainage mat I bought was made by MiraDrain and is among the more high-end drainage mats on the market. I wouldn't necessarily advise going so high-end, since I could only find it by the roll. This was the hardest material to find, and unfortunately I can't seem to find a cheap equivalent for it on Amazon. Your mileage may vary, but I wouldn't leave it out.\nElectric Drill. A good, functional drill is essential. For most of the project I used a cheap, wired Black and Decker drill. It's something I already had on hand and it was enough to get by. I really would recommend a high quality cordless drill though. Once I got about halfway through, I justified buying a much nicer DeWALT 18v Cordless Drill. 18v was all the rage at the time, but if I were buying today, I would go with a 20v DeWALT. You can monitor Amazon for occasional deals and bundles on cordless drills.\nMiter Box and Saw. For the majority of the project, I made all of my cuts by hand using this Stanley miter box and saw. The 1x2 redwood lumber is small enough that it didn't take long to make cuts. Towards the end of the project, I splurged and bought this DeWALT Double Bevel Sliding Compound Miter Saw. It is expensive, but if you have any desire to make additional projects it is a beast of a machine and one of my favorite tools of all time\nCircular Saw or Table Saw. I didn't have a table saw for this project. I didn't have enough room for one, to be honest. Eventually I bought a cheap Skil table saw, but for this whole project I made my plywood cuts using this Skil circular saw. For fine plywood cuts, what's really important is the blade. But what I will say is that just like the drill, if I had to do it again, I would get a good 18v or 20v cordless circular saws like these. My preference is DeWALT, but I also have heard good things about Makita.\nCircular Saw Track/Guide. For this project, I wasn't aware of this product. If I had to do it again I'd get a Kreg accu-cut circular saw guide in a heartbeat. Other companies (like DeWALT) make circular saw tracks as well, but I'm a huge supporter of Kreg and this is an awesome product. For all of my plywood cuts I used two flimsy saw horses and a crude track I made from a long ruler. The Kreg accu-cut makes rip cuts on plywood super simple.\nJig Saw. I had a wired Skil jig saw that I used to cut out the holes for my cooling fans. Make sure you use a fine blade if you choose to do so. In hindsight I would have much preferred to have a cordless one, like this 20v beast from DeWalt. My corded one worked fine, but the wires really do become a pain, and I found myself constantly trying to keep the cord out of the way while cutting.\nSaw Horses. In the beginning I made all of my cuts and did all of my assembly on the garage floor. It didn't take me long to see the value in saw horses. I set a couple pieces of wood across a cheap plastic set of them and used them as a makeshift table for the remainder of my cuts. You can splurge and buy really nice ones, or you can get a cheap set of plastic ones that have basic functionality like saw horses by Stanley. Your back will say thank you.\nWood Screws and Machine Screws. What screws you use is really up to you. I used some higher quality coated torx exterior wood screws. If you go with torx screws, make sure you get the appropriate bit for your drill as well; I find that torx screws are much easier to work with than phillips or flatheads. Machine screws will be used to attach your plexiglas/acrylic sheets. Make sure they have a flat head, and that you use a washer with them. These are a dime a dozen so shop around and get what's available, as long as they can be used exterior.\nPrimer, Paint and Brushes. I'm not an expert with paint, so this is up for debate. But my preference for primer is latex primer by Kilz. I've also heard that Zinsser primer is good as well, but have not used it. I don't have any real reason for recommending a water or latex based primer and paint other than it being lower VOC, and I don't like the idea of oil-based products being in potential contact with my food. For paint it's really up to you. Everyone I spoke to (at orange blue stores) recommended paint brushes by Purdy. They are somewhat expensive and people online seem to like them too. I also heard good things about Wooster paint brushes but didn't try them. I will say that the Purdy brushes I used seemed like they were high quality, but they streaked a lot with the paint I used. It could be that I used low quality paint, or it could be that my brushing technique has much to be desired. Your mileage may very on brushes.\nMATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT FOR THE IRRIGATION AND VENTILATION:\nIf you choose to take the next step and try out a ventilation and irrigation system, here are some of the materials I used.\nWater Pump. Not everyone (actually, probably no one) will use the exact same setup I used for my watering system. Here is a 10w submersible water pump that is very similar to the one I used originally. I tried both submersible and dry pumps. They are relatively cheap and most are probably made in China. The important things to think about are the power consumption and the height it can pump. Many cheaper pumps will not be able to handle the volume or distance you'll want to pump the water, so be cautious. You'll also have to decide on a pump based on your power availability.\nToilet Float. The way you create your float system is not set in stone. I chose this because it was cheap and because it used stuff I had on hand. You can get a cheap toilet float on Amazon and be on your way, or you can go with a slightly more elegant float valve.\nMomentary Lever Switch. I used a momentary lever switch that I had laying around. You'll want a switch that offers some resistance and will be somewhat durable. Again, there might be better ways to do this than what I did. Amazon has a large collection of momentary lever switches you can look through. They're fairly easy to wire, regardless of which you choose, and come in either normally on or normally off configurations.\nArduino Uno. I used an Arduino Uno R3 to run this setup. It was easy to learn on. You can buy kits that include jumper wires, breadboards and multiple other shields and sensors. Really up to you.\nArduino Relay Shield. There are a lot of flavors and options for electronic relays. I was still learning at the time, and so a simple relay shield like these helped me get things going a little quicker. It plugs directly into your Arduino Uno and allows you control of several relays based on inputs. Pretty simple to use once you figure out the Arduino itself.\nDC/AC Inverter. Again, the choice of inverter will depend on what type of pump you get, as well as your power input. You can shop around for dc inverter like one of these if you have an AC pump. If you have a DC pump then it can run straight off your battery.\nBattery. I used a 7 amp hour 12v sealed lead acid battery. I already had this battery on hand, and I kind of designed the system around its capacity. It fit neatly into my battery box. Starting over, I would probably get a deep cycle Marine battery, but those can be prohibitively expensive. It's important to keep the battery secured, dry, and occasionally check on it.\nSolar Panels and Charger/Regulator. I used two 5w 12v solar panels, wired in parallel to a 15w 12v solar panel, for a total 25w nominal power supply. This was good enough for my purposes, and it utilized stuff that I already had on hand. I connected the panels to a solar charge controller, which helps regulate the charging of the battery, prevents current from feeding backwards into the panels, and helps keep the battery topped off correctly, which supposedly extends the batteries life. A charge controller isn't essential, but it is critical.\nComputer Case Fans. I used these computer case fans for my ventilation. They don't consume a lot of power and can run straight off the battery without much fuss.\nSensors. If you want to learn a lot more about Arduino, you can follow my lead and get a temperature and humidity sensor like one of these. I used these to program my Arduino to turn the ventilation fans on automatically if the temperature or interior humidity got too high -- like if I left the greenhouse windows closed by mistake during the day.\nWhew! Ok, so that's a pretty exhaustive list, but it's probably not 100% everything. You'll need additional knick-knacks here and there (if you want) like screws, aluminum rods, jumper wires, and breadboards, among other things. There are some decent jumper wire and breadboard kits out there if you search around, or you can just piece it together as you go.\nA lot of it you can buy as you go, and as you decide whether you want to incorporate it into your design or not.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Truck Farm Goals"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "If you're a total amateur like me, you may not know where to start with your planning phase.\nI hadn't discovered Google Sketchup yet at this point in my life, and so all of my planning was done with crude sketches on graph paper. In retrospect, I could have followed my own advice and been much more exacting in my planning.\nAlas, most of my measurements were ballparks. Most of my cuts were done more than once. Many of my ideas didn't pan out. And quite a few tweaks and additions were made to compensate for errors or lack of planning. Don't be like me. Plan ahead.\nWhere possible, compensate for things like wheel wells in your truck bed. Understand what kind of bed liner you have, if any. Also understand that water can be both life giving and also very destructive... especially to metal framed vehicles.\nDry fit everything... often. I got lucky that everything fit as expected for the most part. But you don't want to spend all this time building something outside of the truck bed, only to move it and find out it doesn't fit!", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: Plan, Plan, Plan"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "All great things start with a good foundation.\nThe first thing I had to do was build the frame. I had some rough sketches already drawn out, but at this point I was mostly building it as I went along. I would measure one member, cut it, then measure the next part. This is horribly inefficient, but I didn't really know any better at the time.\nMy design had a main garden box framed out, with a detachable greenhouse top to cover it up. I still hadn't worked out how to build the top at this point, so I just took things one step at a time.\nI had also accounted for some form of drainage by building a sloped bottom into the design. I achieved this by just adding some shims/blocks underneath some parts of the frame, on top of which I laid some cheap plywood.\nOne of my biggest concerns was moisture accumulating in the truck bed. While I had a good bed liner, I didn't want to take any chances with rust. To that end, my design actually elevated the garden bed a couple inches off the actual bed of the truck, and forced excess water out the tailgate.\nThe frame was then covered with cheap plywood. I wasn't too concerned on wood quality since the wood would either get weatherproofed from painting, or it would be covered by a liner. This was a slight oversight on my part. For any exterior wood project, you should be thinking long term about how to weatherproof your wood. Even if it's not directly exposed to moisture, atmospheric moisture will ultimately compromise it over a long enough time.\nThe frame is important. The plywood is critical!\nI cut a few corners by not surrounding the entire planter box with plywood. The cab-end of the bed was the more raised section, meaning there wouldn't be quite as much soil weight pushing outward. Because of this I chose to save some weight by not bordering this portion with plywood.\nThe rest of the plywood, however, is very important. The garden soil might not be deep enough to compromise the wood frame on its own. But where the plywood really becomes important is in stabilizing the structure from the forces of wind while driving.\nJust like OSB or plywood reinforces the framing of a house, the plywood attached to the frame will keep the farm from becoming a freeway farm. I fastened the plywood using similar exterior wood screws about every foot.

Given that my garden would be on the roadway a lot, surrounded by airborne chemicals everywhere, I wasn't 100% concerned about being too chemically aware, but I wanted to be as neutral as I could.\nMy research lead me to decide on EPDM (ethylene propylene diene monomer) as a lining material. It is a type of rubber that is historically very stable. It is not known to leach chemicals into water like other plastics or rubbers are in the presence of sunlight. Other materials you might run into would be PVC, HDPE and LDPE. The HDPE and LDPE are types of polyethylene which are somewhat stable, but are not quite as resistant as HDPE. PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is very much unstable in the presence of sunlight. It is known widely to leach chemicals into soil and water and to rapidly deteriorate when exposed to sunlight.\nThe clear winner was EPDM. What sold me even more is that it is often used as a pond liner for fish ponds. I figure if the fish aren't dying, it's probably ok to use.\nI shopped around and found a roll of EPDM pond liner that would fit my project and allow me a little wiggle room in case I screwed up my measurements.\nCreate Support\nSo my next step was to add plywood to the bottom of the planter box. I added several support slats, which were then elevated by a shim. I didn't measure the slope of the plywood, but it was more than adequate. A very minor slope is needed to provide for drainage, so I may have gone a little overboard.\nOnce that was cut and installed, I laid my EPDM liner into the bed, marked my cuts and then stapled it in place with heavy duty staples. Because I knew I was going to use staples, I made sure to get a fairly thick liner that I wouldn't have to worry about tearing. I also stapled it MANY times in order to distribute the weight to avoid tearing at any one spot.\nAlong the tailgate end, I left the liner cut and open. I had seen someone else do something similar, and decided I would add a bit of plexiglas to the tail end so that you could see the layers of soil and root structure if you were so inclined.\nI was actually surprised to have gotten the liner right on the first try.\nNow that my garden bed was waterproofed and elevated to allow excess water to run out of the truck bed, I was on to the next step: the drainage mat.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5A/K7PK/JM8ACCJ2/F5AK7PKJM8ACCJ2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYJ/D7DG/JM8ACCFZ/FYJD7DGJM8ACCFZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWM/C7Y0/JM8ACCC8/FWMC7Y0JM8ACCC8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD6/39ZA/JM8ACCVH/FD639ZAJM8ACCVH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F09/FEM8/JM8ACCSE/F09FEM8JM8ACCSE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU1/KFT4/JM8ACCSD/FU1KFT4JM8ACCSD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBC/S8Q3/JM8ACCSC/FBCS8Q3JM8ACCSC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA8/QE64/JM8ACCSB/FA8QE64JM8ACCSB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F06/JFT2/JM8ACCP8/F06JFT2JM8ACCP8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAN/05ZL/JM8ACCM5/FAN05ZLJM8ACCM5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWQ/LPRW/JM8ACC95/FWQLPRWJM8ACC95.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDL/Z8H8/JM8ACC94/FDLZ8H8JM8ACC94.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNY/U2HE/JM8ACC5Z/FNYU2HEJM8ACC5Z.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Line the Bed With EPDM Liner"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "This next step is quite possibly overkill. I had seen it used on another similar project and thought it sounded reasonable.\nThe drainage mat (the one I bought was made by MiraDrain) is a mat with rows of elevated, perforated cones, separated by a semi-permeable landscape fabric.\nThe mat allows water to trickle out of the soil, out of the perforated cones, and cleanly onto my EPDM liner to drain out the back of the truck. Importantly, it also prevents the soil from accompanying the water. While the water would likely drain out on its own due to the slope, you would ultimately end up with some soil erosion and loss over time if you did not use this.\nDrainage mats like this are often used in foundations, basements and other heavy duty, water-saturated situations. For that reason you may think it's excessive (and it very well may be). If you don't use it, you might be ok but you run those risk of losing soil and possibly having an oversaturated bottom layer of soil which might lead to root rot.\nI could only find the drainage mat in large rolls. I only needed enough for a small truck bed, and luckily I was able to negotiate a slightly lower price. Still, I ended up with a lot of excess in the hopes that maybe I'd do another project with it some day. Ultimately it sat in my garage for 3 years until I gave it away to someone.\nThe mat is easy to cut and it interlocks with adjoining layers very easily.

One piece at a time, measured and cut, and re-cut.\nI didn't use any reinforcing plywood because I knew I was going to use plexiglas, which would effectively serve the same purpose. My biggest concern was keeping it secured to the bed frame underneath it.\nI was winging it at this point. I looked at pictures of roof structures on houses and did a loose approximation of what I saw. No research was done into the legality of having this structure on the roadway. I got away with it, so your mileage (haha) may vary.\nOriginally there was the goal of making the frame more heavy duty. I had thought about using aluminum for the whole thing, but felt the learning curve would have been too difficult. I thought learning to screw wood together was easier than learning to weld or machine aluminum. So I decided to stick with redwood 1x2's with horrible joinery.\nI added supporting members along the greenhouse roof to support the plexiglas. I also added supporting structures to where I thought they made sense from an \"engineering\" perspective (note, I have no engineering experience).\nWhere my joinery became too complicated (i.e. screws getting in the way of other screws), I ended up buying some metal hardware to give myself more area to screw into. It wasn't elegant. It probably wasn't safe. But it worked!\nThe greenhouse frame took a long time. Very long. I made so many mistakes in measurement and cutting I possibly increased by costs by 25%.

The enclosure would have to be something that I could somehow take on and off quickly, while still allowing for ventilation and sunlight while on the road.\nThe solution was to use some piano hinges to secure some framed plexiglas windows onto the sides. Then I sided the roof structure with fixed plexiglas panels on top.\nI came up with a very inelegant solution to make the windows open and close. This was not something I had anticipated in the original design, and I winged it. Had I spent more time thinking about it, I'm sure I could have come up with something more functional, but this worked out fine.\nI added a couple of screw eyes/hooks to the interior of the greenhouse roof on each side. Through these I inserted an aluminum rod that I had cut to size.\nThen, in each of the windows I drilled out a couple small pocket holes that the rod could fit into. On the frame of the bed, I attached a couple small plastic washer thingies I found in the hardware aisle. Then, to open the windows, all I'd have to do is lift them up, remove the rod from the inside, and then brace it between the pocket hole and the plastic washer thingy.\nAn added benefit is that the way it was set up kept the rods out of the way for the most part while the window was opened. I also added a couple clamps/locks to the side of each window to be able to lock it closed while driving.\nThis solution ended up being very functional and actually was one of my favorite parts of the build.\nThings I thought about but didn't try\nI bought a couple self-opening/closing hydraulic pistons with the hopes that I'd have a use for them in opening the windows automatically when the temperature got hot enough. They're filled with a wax or some substance, which, when heated, expands, forcing the piston open. It's actually a really cool, functional device... for a stationary greenhouse. There wasn't a way, however, to disable them for when I was on the road, so I ruled those out.\nAfter I had implemented my aluminum rod solution, I came across something that probably would have worked better.

It may crack here and there, but it is highly unlikely to shatter. This is important if I'm going to be driving at high speeds.\nA large portion of the budget went toward plexiglas. In part because it's not really that cheap to begin with. And also because I screwed up a few times.\nSome of the sheets I got cut at the store. Others I bought a plexiglas knife for, then scored and cut myself.\nI cut sheets for the 3 windows, a large sheet for the tailgate end of the planter bed, and then 2 very large sheets for the greenhouse roof.\nThen I predrilled all of my holes and screwed the heck out of it.\nI actually did all of this before painting.\nNotes about cutting plexiglas:\nPlexiglas is pretty easy to cut. You can do it with a razor, or you can do it with a specialized, cheap plexiglas cutting tool (which is basically just a razor anyway). The idea is to score as straight a line as you can, and then re-score it several times. You want to get a considerable distance through the plexiglas. Once you've got a good groove in place, just like a piece of drywall, you should be able to just snap it.\nGetting the plexiglas scored deeply enough is critical. Otherwise you're going to end up with a puzzle-piece looking bit of plexiglas and you'll have to get a new sheet. I learned this the hard way.\nAlso, it's best if you keep the protective film on the plexiglas until you are finished with the project. It may not look like much, but the thin film actually does a great job of keeping your plexiglas from getting scratched. When you're finished you can just peel the film right off.\nNotes about drilling through, and fastening plexiglas:\nPlexiglas is great about direct impacts. Where it's weak is in horizontal torque. When attaching it, I had to drill 2 separate pilot holes. Depending on the size of screw you use, drill a normal pilot hole through the plexiglas and into the wood. Then, with a drill bit larger than the screw you're going to use, expand the hole in the plexiglas.\nUse flat screws with washers!! The screw itself should be holding the plexiglas into the wood, but the threads of the screw should not be contacting the plexiglas itself. If the pilot hole for your screw is too small, the screw will grip the plexiglas and twist, causing cracking.\nI was very careful with this, and even still a few of my holes cracked. I wasn't very concerned because it was fastened in so many other places. The cracks were not very visible, and ultimately the screws still served their purpose in securing it.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCI/DAYL/JM8ACBZG/FCIDAYLJM8ACBZG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUY/1VWD/JM8ACBZF/FUY1VWDJM8ACBZF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCI/U9VW/JM8ACBZE/FCIU9VWJM8ACBZE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWM/1VXM/JM8ACBZ8/FWM1VXMJM8ACBZ8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F34/7CFV/JM8ACBZ7/F347CFVJM8ACBZ7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV7/P5WG/JM8ACBYB/FV7P5WGJM8ACBYB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS6/IRFB/JM8ACBYA/FS6IRFBJM8ACBYA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3P/54HM/JM8ACBY9/F3P54HMJM8ACBY9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNW/7547/JM8ACBY8/FNW7547JM8ACBY8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Cut and Install Plexiglas"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "Ever since I built the truck bed base, I hadn't tried fitting the whole thing into the truck. I didn't know if it would be too tall to get in or out of my garage. I didn't know if it would fit ok in the truck at all. I probably should have done this, but I didn't.\nNow that I was here, though, I was happy to find that it fit PERFECTLY.\nWith the tailgate open, the frame kept the garden from wobbling and was quite secure without being mechanically fastened in any way to the truck itself.\nWith the tailgate closed, it was as if it were a part of the truck itself. I wasn't worried at all about it budging. But I still didn't have great confidence in how the top of the garden would hold out in high speed winds on the freeway...\nWhatever... moving on!\nWhat should you use as your planting media?\nHere's where there's bound to be a lot of debate. Long story short, I didn't make a smart choice. I underestimated how heavy wet, saturated soil is. It still worked fine, but I'm sure my truck was screaming under the load.\nI was concerned about drainage, so I used a base layer of perlite and vermiculite. These aren't always easy to find in bulk, and you'll come out of pocket a fair amount of money if you buy the bagged stuff from Blue or Orange stores. I can't recall how much of each I got, but I tried for a 50/50 mix.\nI threw it into a large tarp on my garage floor and mixed them up to an even distribution. Then I tediously shoveled it into the truck bed. This layer was fairly light and I was satisfied for the most part.\nThe design of the garden bed worked great. It had a natural slope to it, and also had a very short incline at the very end of the bed which kept any of the media from falling out the back. The plexiglas on the tailgate held up perfectly fine against the weight.\nFor the remainder of the bed, I used a standard soil/compost mix. This was my bigger mistake. The total weight of this planting material, when saturated with water, was probably over 1,500 pounds. Not great on my suspension.\nIf I had the resources and money to do it again, I would probably advise using a lighter weight material like LECA (lightweight expanded clay aggregate).

Actually way better than expected.\nI got lots of questions, compliments and interest. Kids in particular loved walking up to it in the parking lot. On occasion I would be there to lower the tailgate and let them look at the layers of soil and roots of the plants. I got this idea that I would quit my job and travel SoCal teaching kids about gardening. That never happened... maybe you can do it :)\nOne of my goals was to have some kind of automated watering and ventilation system. It wasn't particularly necessary because it was such a small space to begin with, and watering it only took a couple of minutes. Nevertheless, I wanted to keep learning.\nMy idea was to have a small water reservoir installed on the side of the garden, connected to solar powered pump and a basic drip system. The reservoir would use a simple float valve/switch to automatically shut off the pump. And then I would have moisture sensors in the soil to trigger the watering cycle.\nKeeping it manly... with ammo cans\nI had some ammo clans left over from this and that. It just so happened that they fit perfectly into the small space on the sides of the garden. I knew ammo cans held up somewhat well to water, and they were cheap enough to replace in the long run.\nMy solution was pretty ugly, and more of a hack, but it was functional.\nFirst ammo can: I used one ammo can as a battery box for a small DC battery. In hindsight, I should have used a deep cycle battery, but I had the SLA battery on hand and figured if I could just keep it dry, it would suffice. I built a small wood frame for the battery inside the ammo can, and also fit inside the Arduino and breadboard.\nSecond ammo can: The second ammo can was strictly for use as a water reservoir and to house the pump. I linked it to the first ammo can with a cheap brass nozzle and some flexible poly tubing. Make sure the pump you use has enough power (large enough head) to pump the water high enough to reach your garden soil. Mine I think was a 9\" head, which was more than enough. Also, A/C pumps tend to be cheaper than D/C, so I bought an A/C pump and then a cheap AC/DC inverter.\nThird ammo can: In the third ammo can, I put a toilet float, attached to a long rod, and hooked up to a manual switch. I don't have a part number for the switch I used, but really any similar pressure switch will work. I sealed the !@#$ out of it with silicone.\nRandom tupperware: I needed a place to physically house my pump and inverter, so I threw them into a rubbermaid tupperware and linked them with more poly tubing to the water reservoirs. This was inelegant, but it was all tucked away on the side of the truck bed anyway.\nThe concept was similar to a toilet bowl tank. When the Arduino triggered the pump, it would start pumping until the float valve got low enough to toggle the switch, telling the Arduino to stop the pump. The Arduino would trigger the pump automatically either on a timer, when soil moisture was too low, or manually with a button on the shield.\nI never got around to programming the moisture sensor, but it was still somewhat automated in the sense that I could just fill my ammo cans and push a button and it would water.\nI no longer have my Arduino solutions for this, but if I could figure it out with zero background I'm sure you can as well. I will say that I used an Arduino Uno with a Relay Shield, a simple breadboard initially, and a starter set of jumper wires. It was all low current stuff, so nothing really heavy duty was required. Ultimately I bought some soldering equipment and learned how to solder, and got rid of the breadboard.\nI added a LED to the Arduino so I could have a visual indicator of when it was attempting to water. I drilled a hole in the ammo can so I could see the LED.\nPowering the system\nAs I said before, I had a sealed lead acid battery which I hooked up to a few solar panels and a solar charger/regulator. I used two cheap 5W and a 15W solar panel, which I screwed to some strong neodymium magnets. I then attached the magnets to the top of my truck's roof and wired the panels to my battery box and Arduino.\nThe battery was then wired to an AC/DC inverter, which was used to power my AC pump.\nWhile I was at it, I bought some cheap, low power CPU case fans. I hooked them up to a temperature and humidity sensor, which I programmed with the Arduino to trigger under certain circumstances. The programming for this is relatively simple. The fans were DC fans, so they were not required to be hooked up to the inverter.\nThe temperature and humidity sensors produced an analog output which could be easily read by the Arduino. At whatever level you like, you can trigger a response from the Arduino. This is not a programming Instructable because it's beyond my scope, and even though I did it, it's almost certainly beyond my expertise to teach.\nI used a very fine blade jigsaw to cut holes in the plexiglas.

I bought some add-a-leaf springs for my truck to help its suspension a bit, and otherwise the truck was not negatively affected at all. The bed and liner were in perfect shape when I finally removed the Truck Farm from the bed. In large part, I feel this was because I had taken care to separate the wet soil from the truck itself with a physical barrier.\nIf you're interested in trying this, here are a few suggestions:\nChoose your growing media wisely. Find something lightweight that drains well and you may be able to forgo other expensive items like the drainage mat.\nChoose plants wisely based on available space. It's very disappointing to have to kill a plant that is otherwise healthy, because you made a bad choice on what to plant in the first place.\nUnless you're interested in learning Arduino and all that other fun stuff, keep it simple. Such a small raised bed takes only a few minutes to water. An automated drip system is not necessary. Adequate ventilation is important, but again for such a small space, you probably don't need fans.\nDesign your structure with care. I got lucky that my whole structure stayed together. I know more about woodworking now and realize how flimsy the whole thing really was. I could have made the structure much more stable while using considerable less wood in some areas.\nTake care of your wood. Take the time to properly treat and seal exposed wood framing. I painted as much as I could, but even so, the wood ultimately rotted within 2 years. Even having rotted, the greenhouse stayed put together, but once I removed it from the truck to sell the truck, it became evident that it wasn't very stable anymore.\nEnjoy the process. Many of my projects end in abject failure, or they are constant works in progress. Few are outright successes. The true success comes from the experience and the knowledge gained during the process.\nBelieve it or not, I am not the only Truck Farm. In fact, as I discovered after I had originally thought of the idea, there was a group of guys that made a small film/documentary about their own truck farm. I used their design as a foundation/basis for my own, but otherwise it is all original work. I even came up with the idea on my own, and just so happened to discover their awesome project afterward. This lends some credibility to the idea, at least, that multiple people, separated by many miles, came up with a very similar idea.\nI hope you have success if you try it, or maybe at least get some fun ideas from it.\nThis project also served as a gateway to my interest in homesteading. Because of my successes, I used some of the lessons learned to build a healthy, huge raised bed in my back yard from cinder blocks. I also wrote an Instructable on that, which you can view here: Build a Concrete Block Garden!\nThanks for reading!", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 15: Lessons Learned"}], "channel": "Gardening"}, {"category": "Home", "description": "My idea was to create an original kitchen island at a reasonable cost ...

(Not SIPS-Structural Insulated Panels) What are those? Both Zip and Sip Panels are used to build tiny homes. It's a personal choice. I went with Zip panels. Here is why...\nAs I researched the best way to \"wrap\" a tiny house frame I decided that this was actually a very good option. Zip panels are essentially OSB (Oriented Strand Board) coated on one side with a water resistant membrane layer.\nUsing Zips also made attaching the panels MUCH easier. No plastic wrap flying in the wind. I also found out that Zips are available in an \"R\" panel, meaning that a layer of rigid foam insulation is attached to the non-membrane side of the panel. Bingo! Sort of an \"all in one\" solution.\nBONUS: Without realizing it I accidentally 'solved' potential thermal bridging issues by using Zip R panels. Thermal Bridging is temperature variation between materials that can cause sweating, moisture buildup, mold, unwanted changes in material from moisture, etc. Read up on Thermal Bridging and make every effort to reduce it as much as possible.\nI can honestly say that going with a galvanized steel frame and Zip panels saved a ton of time and did not increase costs that much.

When a house on wheels is built, the pipes are sealed in a stable, non \"jarred\" environment... sort of like poured in place cement/concrete.\nA little vibration on the road is not a big deal, but a hard bump or jar from 'bottoming out' the back end will 'break' a seal. It's usually minor but very quickly will result in a leak. A leak can go undetected for a long time, because it's typically hidden in a wall or cabinet.\nIf the bathroom, main plumbing is over or in front of the axles, it greatly reduces the \"jar\" effect when a bump is encountered thereby preserving that original plumbing seal.\nSince I do all my own repair work (except heavy duty electrical) I don't want to tear out a wall to do any plumbing or electrical repair, then have to repair the wall! Ugh... And being an artist, I want to easily display art in the Bacon Bungalow. Copper tubing is gorgeous! And industrial looking black or silver pipe (or PVC painted to look like pipe) provides more than one use. The plan is to use copper pipe as a decorative / multifunctional element for plumbing (easy to see the exact location of a leak should that happen) and painted PVC pipe as conduit for the electrical elements. It will add to the rustic, industrial, multi-purpose interior and make everything easier/quicker to repair with (hopefully) less overall damage in the process.

To remove the rust, you let the piece soak in vinegar for about 20 minutes and then you take a 150 grit piece of sandpaper and you scrub until the rust is removed. With most metal pieces this size, it should clear the rust right up. *Tip* try applying this method to some of your rusty tools, knives etc!

So this is definitely not a new idea for making doors out of stainless steel but the different thing is that I am going to build it without tig or MIG welding, not because of a challenge, but in reality, I really don't have those machines. But I personally think that for building something out of limited tools the only thing you need the determination, which I think plenty enough in my body. So I made this project with stick welding and that was really a challenge for me. Because usually, their wall thickness is not enough for stick weld. Most of the times there are chances of metal warping and blow holes but if you are going with stitch welding then you get better results rather then the long welds. If you think that any of my statement has no weight than I think you have to give one shot to stainless steel project and try to finish it with stick welding. I am working with these metals for almost 2 years, even then I am not perfect in the welding of stainless steel with stick welding, although there was no slag visible onto my project, there is still lack of finish in the joints. Although they shine like what it has to be but I personally think that there is a lot more to learn still in stainless steel welding. I made a couple of projects in the past and as the time pass on I saw little bit improvement in my builds. I think that's called an experience which only achieved by giving something some time. So that's all about this build and if you like this build than make sure to leave your feedback in the comment section down below. If you want to share your experiences than leave them as well I am definitely interested in them. Along with this project I use all the basic safety equipment which are required to build this project, if I missed something then I didn't have that.", "title": "Stainless Steel Doors", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Stainless-Steel-Doors/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "For cutting down the material most of the time I use the chop saw and but I think you can do all that with the angle grinder as well as its most versatile tool in making but you have to be careful with that. I didn't use it with guard but not recommend you to do that. Always Use proper safety equipment while using power tools. For the material, I use ss202, since these doors remain under a shade and I think they have very less contact with rain that's the reason I choose ss202. I go with 3 different dimensions of the material, but this thing completely depends upon your requirements. I don't want these to be too heavy that's why I go with 1\u201d dimension in the thickness of the pipe, the width varies according to the need.\nFor the mainframe, I use 1\"X 3\" pipe, for the middle design I use 1\" X 2\" section and for the support structure of the sheets, I use 1/2\" square pipe. The sheet cut to the custom shape with the help of an angle grinder depends upon your design. The main frame is welded together with but joints and all of the interior 1/2\" square pipes are connected with the miter joint.\nFor the inserts, I used Brazilian ipe wood as an insert. I wanted to make CNC inserts But at the time of this build my machine gave up. Although the plan was to make V carve inlay and fill that with the glow in dark resin but in the end, it wasn't succeeded\nTools Used:-\nFollowing are the list of tools I used in this build.

I have plywood pieces with which I create an 8ft long table. Then I lay my pieces onto the work table. I clamped one side to the table since I didn't have big deep clamps I decided to make jigs which holds the pieces to its place so that during the welding if any warping occurs those clamps help to prevent that warpage. After that check then with the help of square because if this went wrong it would be difficult to correct that mistake unlike the wooden doors we can easily trim down the excess with the help of planer or some other tools but in Stainless steel pipes this wouldn't be possible. So always kept some margin while making metal doors. Then I first tack weld all the corners and then check the squareness of the frame and everything seems ok. Then I started the work onto the the square which are going to held my inserts in them. Here I prefer Miter joint to make it look more clean and smooth. I didn't do the complete weld on these squares as well. Then I lay pieces into the door main frame and make them square to the side and start the tack weld process. I flip the frame to the other side and tack weld from backside as well.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKJ/UKEA/JM0V2763/FKJUKEAJM0V2763.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif"], "step_title": "Step 3: Welding the Basic Skeleton"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "once the tack weld has been done on both sides of the frame I check the squareness of the frame and then stop the welding. At this point one thing has to be note down that if you are welding thin metal then never go with continuous weld beads because if you do so then you might end it up a blowhole in the material with the stick welding. Generally tig welding is used for stainless steel work since I don't have that that's why I used stick welding. For the welding I used stitch welding technique in which I made a tack and stop for a second and then tack again and so on. So what this thing does is that when you take a break after each tack then it gives the metal sometime to cool down and in next tack, there would be no problem. I follow this technique on all joints and complete the welding work. You can see in the images that how those tack welds are done. Since I have a requirement of two doors I do the same thing with both of them.", "step_imgs": ["https://www.instructables.com/files/deriv/FSD/MUEP/JM0V28SJ/FSDMUEPJM0V28SJ.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0E/S946/JM0V290R/F0ES946JM0V290R.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQJ/7SD1/JM0V292C/FQJ7SD1JM0V292C.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Finalising the Welding"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Once the basic frame has been completed I start the work onto the decorating portion. I measured the dimensions of the top Plus sign and then transfer those measurements onto the Steel sheet having a thickness of 1 mm and then cut it with the help of angle grinder. During the cutting, I placed some scrap pieces of wood so that they did not damage the marble surface. For cutting the sheets I want to suggest you that instead of scoring lines over the surface was not a good idea rather than that you have to enter into the material from one side with the complete cut and then follow your marking lines. Buy this way there are fewer chances of the grinder to slip off. I cut down these sheets slightly undersized so that there would be no problem while tack welds them on to the door. To provide a structural support to the sheet I cut out some half inch square tube follow the profile where I am going to weld these sheets. For the visible area, I decided to choose mitre joint and the area where joints not visible I prefer simple but joint.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOD/BD71/JM0V2A5O/FODBD71JM0V2A5O.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJO/FJFY/JM0V29WZ/FJOFJFYJM0V29WZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVK/AREK/JM0V29XN/FVKAREKJM0V29XN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9T/8RAX/JM0V29YC/F9T8RAXJM0V29YC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN7/4R0T/JM0V29YY/FN74R0TJM0V29YY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHA/9MDY/JM0V29ZK/FHA9MDYJM0V29ZK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX1/GK3N/JM0V2A06/FX1GK3NJM0V2A06.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Support Pieces and Sheet Cutting"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Once material has been cut down I deburr the edges and then start the welding process. For welding the sheets I have to first weld the support pieces and for that instead of going for long continuous weld I decided to go with some tack welds. In one of the door instead of installing the sheet I decided to weld some \u00bd\u201d square pipes in such a way that it looks pleasant to eyes. This thing makes it airy also. In the middle of the door I decided to screw a piece of ipe wood as its most dens wood and have no effect of water onto it as it's a rainforest wood. Initially the plan was to make a v carve designs into it and then filled it with the resin and I think that will definitely increase the beauty of this door. But unfortunately there are some issues occurred in my CNC as it started skipping the steps, it also break some of my precious v bits and because of that I decided to leave that part. In the second door I weld the sheet into the lower portion because I have to install this in a room and I don't want the dust to enter in the room. Until this time I decided not to remove the protective covering from the sheets as it gets the scratch quite easily because of the mirror finish onto it. Even if I am going to use newly buffing wheel with compound onto the surface it creates fine scratches onto the surface. Once the support braces has been welded on to the door design periphery I tack weld the sheet from back side as well and off camera I made some blow onto the sheets to check whether it holds up or not, but there is no change occurs into the material which is a good sign that everything works nice and sturdy.", "step_imgs": ["https://www.instructables.com/files/deriv/FKS/XRQY/JM0V2AKL/FKSXRQYJM0V2AKL.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP4/20TG/JM0V2AIL/FP420TGJM0V2AIL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWP/NWDS/JM0V2AJD/FWPNWDSJM0V2AJD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1T/70DV/JM0V2AJE/F1T70DVJM0V2AJE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ0/TVQU/JM0V2AJH/FZ0TVQUJM0V2AJH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAF/T1V4/JM0V2AJJ/FAFT1V4JM0V2AJJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4C/3VHS/JM0V2AX3/F4C3VHSJM0V2AX3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPG/IDDF/JM0V2B06/FPGIDDFJM0V2B06.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Welding the Decorative Parts."}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Since I am using stick welding that's why the weld beads or not that much good as compared to tig welding and also because of the temperature and the material thickness the joints are slightly wobbly. To remove most of the material I chose flexible grinding disk which removes most of the heavy weld beads. From my last stair railing project someone suggests me not to use these aggressive grinding disc onto stainless steel and I also not recommend those disk as well onto the stainless steel, but in my builds I not usually do it with too much aggression, just give it a light run onto the joint. Then with the help of 120 grit flap disc remove the scratches made by the previous disc. After that I switch onto the Scotch Brite wheel and give a good standing until it diminished the scratches created by flap disk. Once scratches has been removed I switch the wheel to the buffing one and with the help of green compound buff all the surface. Although I didn't get factory like finish onto some of the joints but at the end they are not noticeable from a distance of 1 ft and more. Buffing part is one of the most time consuming process in stainless steel builds. No matter how careful you are during the welding time the scratches came all over the surface and in the end you have to remove all of them to make it look more cleaner. In my case, I took 2 days to finish both doors and it's definitely a challenging task. Sometime it seems that finish has been completed then at some spot scratch become visible and then I have to move to remove that also.", "step_imgs": ["https://www.instructables.com/files/deriv/FDV/WQOF/JM0V2CDY/FDVWQOFJM0V2CDY.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif"], "step_title": "Step 7: Buffing the Doors."}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "For the final finishing touches I welded 4 hinges each having 5 inches long spaced out roughly and then welded with the one side of the door, so that it will hang up to the door frame.

Do some tests if you like, as some tape (like mine) will leave glue residue on the glass.\nMain point is, it has to be strong enough to stick strongly enough to withhold liquid for a short period of time, but not too strong so it won't come off, or wont come off without leaving a mess of glue behind.\nI learned that my cheap duct tape wasn't ideal, even after being weakened. Only when I screw up a few pieces (nose and eyes) and used \"Liquid\" glue, meant to glue shoe soles and stuff, did I get something that stuck tightly, but didn't leave much behind. So its worth checking out if glue could be an option for you (let it dry a bit on the pieces before sticking it on the glass, and make sure to put glue to the very edge)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKC/7KPN/JLQUTRVK/FKC7KPNJLQUTRVK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP0/RAYD/JLQUTRVM/FP0RAYDJLQUTRVM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9R/2MNJ/JLQUTRWE/F9R2MNJJLQUTRWE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Make a Face"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "This is key!

But did you find yourself using the same old boring language again? Then you should take a look at William Shakespeare's elegant way of insulting people. Even though he died over four hundred years ago, his witty insults are just as impressive and hilarious today as they were all those centuries ago.\nIt's not easy to come up with the perfect insult. It takes time and effort, and it's also important to know a little bit about the way Shakespeare concocted his insults before you can give it a go yourself. So pay attention, be patient, and read on.\nDisclaimer: Obviously, I am aware of the 'be nice' policy at Instructables. I am in no way trying to be unkind or to spread hate. I simply consider this an entertaining way of using creative language, and I hope you do, too.", "title": "How to Swear Like Shakespeare", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Swear-Like-Shakespeare/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "What you need in order to write a proper insult, is, obviously, pen and paper. You might also want to use a pencil for brainstorming.\nAlso make sure you get a dictionary, and, if you have one, a thesaurus. A dictionary is useful, since the English language has changed a lot in four hundred years, and some words Shakespeare used might have become unfamiliar. A thesaurus, a book that lists words and their synonyms, might come in handy when you want to spice up your language. If you don't have a physical copy, just look it up on the internet - oh, the joys of living in the Digital Age!\nFurthermore, if you're really determined to hurt someone to their very core, make sure to get a copy of the Collected Works of William Shakespeare. There's a plethora of brilliant examples just waiting to be read that will inspire you to give it your all and come up with the most inventive of insults.\nBut first: a short introduction to William Shakespeare.

That would be far too easy. Instead, he had a wide range of themes he could pick from in order to deliver the cruellest insult imaginable. I will list the most important ones here, accompanied by some examples. Make sure you read them carefully, because you will base your final insults on the next two steps!\n- Personal attributes. If you want to make it personal, you should focus on intelligence (or lack thereof) or their occupation. Nobody likes it when that happens. \"I was seeking for a fool when I found you.\"\n- Animals. It's always a good idea to insult someone by telling them they remind you of a specific animal. The more disgusting the animal, the better. We still do that, too. You could call someone a dog or a pig, and everyone would know exactly what you mean. Shakespeare, of course, turned this into an art form in itself. \"What a slug\" or \"A very toad\" are great examples.\n- Food and inanimate objects. This is kind of the same as the one above, but with food or other things instead of animals: \"Thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg\". Oh, that one hurts! Another one I really like is \u201cThe tartness of his face sours ripe grapes.\u201d\n- Diseases. Well, this one makes sense, I guess. If someone tells you you're like a disease, that can never be a compliment. Shakespeare specialised on this particular topic, \"Thou art a boil, a plague-sore, an embossed carboncle\" being one of my favourites, for if one disease doesn't do it, just add some more.\n- Body parts and physical appearance. It's always fun to refer to someone's body when you want to give them a proper scolding, as many people have at least one aspect they don't like that much about themselves. It's also fun to tell someone that they lack something they should have: \"Thou thing of no bowels, thou\" or that they have something they would rather not have: \"Thou odoriferous stench\".\nIf you want to look at all these topics in a lovely, insightful infographic, take a look at this site:\nhttps://curiouscharts.com/products/a-taxonomy-of-g...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FY3/I9JH/JL6V1W4P/FY3I9JHJL6V1W4P.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: \"I Scorn You, You Scurvy Companion\" - Pick the Theme of Your Insult"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "There are several ways in which you can deliver the perfect Shakespearean insults. Some are easier to compose than others, but I want to share the most entertaining ones with you. Read them through, and decide which one you like best, or which one simply works most for you.\n- \"Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog.\" This type of Shakespearean insult is by far the most popular one. You simply start your sentence with thou, then use two fancy adjectives, followed by a noun (choose from any of the themes mentioned in step 2). There are several Shakespeare Insult Generators online, or even available as a hardcover book. Use this site, for instance: https://9gag.com/gag/aA195WE/the-shakespearean-in.... Just pick a word from each column, and there's your insult. It's a lot of fun to practise with these, as they are relatively easy to create.\n- \"Thou art a fleshmonger, a fool and a coward.\"Instead of hurling adjectives at the person you're trying to hurt with your words, just tell them what they are, loud and clear. The more insulting words, the better, of course!\n- \"Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon.\" Usually when someone wishes you something, it's definitely a good thing. However, Shakespeare turns it around and uses a wish in order to completely burn them down.\n- \"Thou hast no more brain than I have in mine elbows.\" If you really want to insult someone stylishly, just make sure you compare them to something. There are endless examples with this type of insult.\n- \"I would beat thee, but I would infect my hands\". Instead of telling people what they are like, just turn it around by describing the unpleasant effect the person has on you. This stings more than just telling people they are, for example, merely disgusting.\nThere. It's a lot of information, but I hope you've manage to remember most of it.

The best way to do this, would be to experiment with different themes - it's great fun!\nSecondly, what type of insult would you throw at him? A simple \"thou ...\" one? Or wish him something? Compare him to something? Again, you decide what you like best. Don't forget to write it all down! If you keep notes while coming up with examples, it's so much easier to come up with the perfect insult!\nIf you're happy with both of these aspects, then you should combine them and write down what you think will become the final version of your insult, but in your own words, in modern language.

And it worked! For about 6 months... then the rubber was so damaged, that it fell off and I was right at the beginning...\n\nSo a decision has been made... I need to make my dog a new bowl stand, that would fit into house I was moving in. It had to be modern and eye-friendly while still being easy to clean and maintain.

However, here is my approach.\n\nI had some pine trees laying around my house which were cut about 2 years ago. Since my house look is wooden - pine - it should go well there. First I used a chainsaw to cut a piece, approximately 50 cm in length. The thickness of the log that I chose was about 5 cm more than the diameter of the bowls. My first wish was to keep the bark, but it later turned out to be a bad idea.\n\nI used industrial bend saw to get two parallel cuts on the log. I set the base at the machine and used a 5x7x50cm straight piece of wood - which was used as a piece base. I used two screws to fix this wooden base down to a log - this base was pressed down the bend saw's base to make a straight cut. I made my first cut, which is now the bottom side (marked as cut 1 on picture). Then I removed the bolts, and used a fresh cut to machine base to make a second cut, parallel to first. I was quite happy with the cuts, as they were quite straight and parallel. I used a joiner to provide an even better and straighter surface, but this step can easily be skipped. You can proceed straight to sanding.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJA/TVI8/JL6UXYB5/FJATVI8JL6UXYB5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAN/JYEP/JLCKIKX0/FANJYEPJLCKIKX0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: From Log to Flattened Base"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I've used a router and a circle jig that I made (similar to this one) to cut the outer diameter of the holes.

This way I removed most of the material for the holes quite easily. I first tried the 55 mm drill but it was too much so I switched to a 35 mm which did the job as expected. The bits that were left came down easily with the chisel. Now you're left with rough holes for bowls. Because I also wanted to put some epoxy resin for sealing the wood, a further sanding was needed to make the surface smoother. It is quite hard to apply epoxy over rough areas.\n\nFor this project I made some quick drill press tool. The tool did its job but I would advise caution - too much pressure can bend your tool or even damage it! I used a circular saw to cut the log to the appropriate size - it was larger before so I could guide the router easier.\n\nThe rough shape of the bowl is now done!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFZ/XPQL/JKPWPG2G/FFZXPQLJKPWPG2G.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Cut Holes"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The bark already came off and revealed some beautiful saturation of the wood.

There was no other solution then to put both sides to planner and I was back to the start.\n\nThat got me a piece of wood which was straight but contained few cracks, where water could easily do more damage. In the past i filled such cracks with epoxy and got desirable result. I used clear epoxy, so i can see the crack, but others prefer black one. You can buy a clear epoxy and taint it with ink black colour.\nSo about those cracks... Spend as much time investigating where this cracks go and make sure you put a duck tape to all sources of the cracks otherwise epoxy will pour out of those. After all those cracks are filled and epoxy is cured take a sander and make sure that surface is even so we can make a coat for next step.\n\nI've mixed the epoxy again and applied it to the wood. The wood must be levelled so you could just pour the resin onto it and it will produce an even - about 0.5mm thick finish - it pours on the sides as well. First you must put some duck tape on the sides, to pour the epoxy to bottom. The resin should not pour onto sides in this step! If it does... sand it down to wood surface! Then move wood around and raise it a bit - so epoxy can pour to the floor (make sure to put some paper on floor!). There will be some air bubbles... you can put them out via heat gun!

At the same time, aquaponics minimizes water waste due to it's perpetual recycling of the water in the system. Aquaponics has been successfully used in areas of the world effected by drought, pollution, and even lack of farmable land (such as cities). Many people have been interested in aquaponics, but are unsure of where to start or are nervous about getting started. In this guide I will take you from start to finish, and show you in detail how to build your own aquaponics system for indoor use.

First, the parts of the system:\nFish Tank - The fish tank is exactly what it sounds like. This is where the fish reside. It can be anything from a 55 gallon barrel to a swimming pool. The fish tank should be made of non-toxic materials, and large enough to meet the needs of your fish.\nGrow Bed - The grow bed is where your plants will grow. The grow bed should also be made of non-toxic materials, hold water, and be strong. The grow bed should be deep enough to sustain proper root growth for your plants; ten to twelve inches deep is the standard here. It will be filled with grow media to hold the plants and allow roots to grow.\nEbb and Flow (Flood and Drain) - This is the type of aquaponics system I will be using in this instructable. This type of system floods the grow bed, and then drains through a siphon providing nutrient rich water and oxygen for the roots.\nThings to consider before building your indoor aquaponics system:\nWhen designing your own system you will want to consider several things. First where will your system reside? Water weighs 8.34 pounds or 3.78 kilograms per gallon. Multiply that by the total volume of your system to find the total water weight. In the example here I have 55 gallons in my fish tank which is about 459 pounds or 208 kg. The grow bed will contain grow media which is also quite heavy. Consider your system could weight up to 1000 pounds or more. You will want it placed in an area that can sustain such weight.\nOther things to consider is the water your system holds. Should your system fail and spill of it's contents on the floor what will that look like? Will 55 gallons of water destroy the area your system resides in?\nSince this system is designed to be indoors, the environmental conditions can be controlled to an extent. Water temperature, light, and humidity are important factors to consider when selecting plants and fish. Technically speaking, you could be living in Canada and grow bananas in your aquaponics system. The right conditions will need to be created, but by building your system indoors these conditions can be met. Consider the power requirements this might need when selecting your plants and fish.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Aquaponics Basics"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The grow bed I built here is constructed of plywood. The inside dimensions are 24\"x 36\"x 10\". I drilled two holes in the grow bed. The first hole is in the bottom for the siphon. This hole is big enough for a 3/4\" male pvc adapter to fit into. The second hole is towards the top of the grow bed. This hole is a fail safe. If the siphon fails for any reason and the grow bed continues to flood, this hole provides an escape for the water to flow back into the fish tank rather than all over the floor. I cut mine big enough for a 1/2\" piece of pvc pipe to fit into.\nThis grow bed is made out of plywood so it will need to be coated with a non-toxic water proof covering before it can be used for your indoor aquaponics system. For this I used Flex Seal. Flex Seal is great for water proofing any part of your system you don't want to get wet, and once cured, is non-toxic and non conductive. It takes 24 hours to cure, so plan ahead and take your time with this step. Make sure you cover every part of your tank to ensure proper water sealing; any small hole left uncovered could destroy your grow bed when exposed to water over time.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FM1/OY3X/JIYU73MY/FM1OY3XJIYU73MY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJQ/8T4Q/JIYU73M0/FJQ8T4QJIYU73M0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTT/JAQR/JIYU73M1/FTTJAQRJIYU73M1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMY/1C0M/JIYU73M2/FMY1C0MJIYU73M2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F43/2VLD/JIYU73M3/F432VLDJIYU73M3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZX/IIUF/JIYU73M4/FZXIIUFJIYU73M4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBL/8J0L/JIYU73M7/FBL8J0LJIYU73M7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRU/0QVK/JIYU73MU/FRU0QVKJIYU73MU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Grow Bed"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "For my indoor aquaponics system I'm using a 55 gallon tote.

Make sure these planks are at least 4 inches tall to provide enough clearance for the plumbing coming from the siphon to the fish tank.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FW5/EHXH/JIYU73LP/FW5EHXHJIYU73LP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOI/6IIZ/JIYU73LX/FOI6IIZJIYU73LX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: The Fish Tank"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "A bell siphon is used in ebb and flow aquaponics and hydroponics systems in order to regulate the flow of water. In an ebb and flow (also known as flood and drain) system water is pumped into the grow bed. At a specific point (usually 2 inches below the surface) the water drains via the bell siphon. When the water reaches the bottom you will hear the classic gurgle indicating the end of the drain phase. The process will then repeat itself over and over again. The bell siphon is such an important part of any ebb and flow system that getting it right is crucial.\nParts and Tools needed to make a Bell Siphon:\nGravel Guard 1 - 3\" PVC pipe (approximately 12\" long)\nBell Dome 1 - 2\" PVC pipe (approximately 10\" long)\n1 - 2\" PVC cap Bell Siphon\n1 - \u00be\u201d PVC pipe (approximately 6\" long)\n1 - \u00be\u201d to 1 \u00bd\u201d bell adapter\nGrow Bed Connections 1 - \u00be\u201d Male adapter (thread to slip)\n1 - \u00be\u201d Female adapter (thread to slip)\n2 - #18 o-rings Drain Pipe 2 - \u00be\u201d PVC pipe 4\" long\n1 - \u00be\u201d 90\u00b0 elbow\nTools\nDrill or Dremel\nDrill bit (\u215b\u201d)\nPreparing the Dome and Guard\nI created a guide that you can use to make clean and equally spaced holes around the bottom of your gravel guard and bell dome. First download the \u201cBell Holes Guide\u201d document (link to dropbox) and print it. You will likely get an error message saying, \"The margins of section 1 are outside the printable area of the page. Do you want to continue?\" Click Yes. Cut out the two guides, wrap each guide around the bottom of your PVC pipes (the 3\" gravel guard, and the 2\" Bell dome), and tape them in place. Use the guide to drill \u215b\u201d holes around the bottom of each pipe. Remove the guides and clean up any leftover PVC dust or tags.\nBuilding the Siphon\nFollow the Bell Siphon Diagram to put the siphon together. Start with the male and female adapters. Take the male adapter and slip a #18 o-ring over the threads. Insert the adapter through the access hole in the grow bed. Slip another #18 o-ring over the top of the male threads. Screw the female adapter to the male adapter (no jokes here folks) making sure you have a tight connection. It\u2019s not necessary to get the tools to tighten it, hand tight or even slightly less than is fine (you'll be checking for leaks later anyways so it's not necessary to overdue it). Slip a 6\" piece of 3/4\" PVC pipe into the female adapter (The diagram says this is 4\", start with 6\" and check the water line when you're done. If the water line is too high, make a note and adjust this pipe as needed). Slip the 3/4\" to 1 1/2\" bell adapter on top of the 3/4\" PVC pipe . To create an effective drain flow it is important that the opening of the Bell is double the size of the pipe (\u00be\u201d * 2 = 1 \u00bd\u201d). Slide the PVC Bell Dome (Again, start with 10\" and adjust if the water line is too high) over the drain pipe, and the PVC stone guard over this. For the underside of the grow bed slide a piece of \u00be\u201d pipe into the bottom of the adapter. Slide a \u00be\u201d PVC 90 into the bottom of this pipe, and from there another \u00be\u201d PVC pipe. Depending on the location of the fish tank you will need to size these last two pipes appropriately.\nTest it out\n\nAfter you have your bell siphon put together feel free to test it by filling the tank. Take note of the water level where the siphon starts, and especially the max height of the water. The max height of the water should be 2\" below the grow media surface. If you need to adjust any pipes now is the time to do it. For example, if your water line is an inch above the mark, take an inch off the top of the siphon pipe, and an inch off the top of the bell dome.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FM0/Z3L9/JIYU8NNS/FM0Z3L9JIYU8NNS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F61/UP68/JIYU73MK/F61UP68JIYU73MK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTG/5UTH/JIYU73ML/FTG5UTHJIYU73ML.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F14/08JP/JIYU73MM/F1408JPJIYU73MM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F93/EI8B/JIYU73NV/F93EI8BJIYU73NV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F43/IMLY/JIYU73NQ/F43IMLYJIYU73NQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F43/CSDY/JIYU73NZ/F43CSDYJIYU73NZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: The Siphon"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Automated Water Pumps\nOne thing I really wanted to automate was the pumps. In an Ebb and Flow system you would normally need to watch how long it takes to fill up the grow bed until it begins to drain down the siphon. You would then set your pump to a timer so that your grow beds aren\u2019t sitting in too much or too little water for too long. This is tedious, and the fillup time is variable.\nTo automate the process I\u2019m using an Arduino Uno Microcontroller to receive an input signal from a Hygrometer (moisture sensor). Depending on the signal (wet or dry), the arduino will turn the pump on or turn it off. In action the pump will be on until the grow bed fills up and the siphon activates the drain process. When the water drains, the hygrometer will pick up on the moisture (100% in this case) and tell the arduino to shut off the pump for 30 minutes. After this dry cycle, the arduino checks the hygrometer for moisture (it\u2019s been dry for 30 minutes) and turns the pump on again if it\u2019s dry. This takes care of the variable flood times, and ensures a proper flood and drain cycle.\nParts for the flood and drain automation system\nHardware\nArduino\n5V 1 Channel Relay\nHygrometer\nPump\n3/4\" T fitting\nTools\nWire Strippers\nVarious Wires\nSetting it up\nFollow the instructions here to setup your arduino for the first time. Once you have the arduino software on your computer you can download the sketch for the automated ebb and flow system here. Once you\u2019ve downloaded the ebb and flow sketch you can open it and upload it to your arduino board. If everything has uploaded successfully you can begin hooking up all the hardware to make the magic happen.\nThe hygrometer sensor checks for water in the drain pipe. Because of this we need to make a module containing the hygrometer that connects to the drain pipe. I did this by inserting a \u00be\u201d PVC T in line with the siphon drain pipe. I made a module out of a small piece of \u00be\u201d pipe with a \u00be\u201d cap on top. The hygrometer is contained within this end cap with two holes to allow the sensor wires to connect to the arduino. To prevent any leaks or damage you can cover the holes and secure the hygrometer inside with non-toxic silicone or flex seal.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYS/9C63/JIYU73LW/FYS9C63JIYU73LW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8W/5LF5/JIYU73MA/F8W5LF5JIYU73MA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMB/AJ4S/JIYU73MB/FMBAJ4SJIYU73MB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8M/RD92/JIYU73MF/F8MRD92JIYU73MF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ5/8X12/JIYU73MG/FQ58X12JIYU73MG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLF/Y0CQ/JIYU73MH/FLFY0CQJIYU73MH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU4/L99I/JIYU73MI/FU4L99IJIYU73MI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNN/J9MP/JIYU73MJ/FNNJ9MPJIYU73MJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMF/W80R/JIYU73N1/FMFW80RJIYU73N1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRX/81P1/JIYU73PA/FRX81P1JIYU73PA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYD/0MDJ/JIYU73P9/FYD0MDJJIYU73P9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD0/SF3Y/JJ4JUGFI/FD0SF3YJJ4JUGFI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Ebb and Flow Automation"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Flooding\nFlooding the grow bed is easy enough.

When choosing media there are several things worth considering. Some of the biggest factors to consider are cost, weight, pH neutrality, and surface area. Here is a short list of some of the most common media used in aquaponics.\nHydroton Clay Pebbles - Clay pebbles are a great choice for grow media. They are pH neutral, easy on the hands, light weight, have a large surface area, and don't break down. This media choice is traditionally what you will find in most aquaponics systems. One downside to hydroton clay pebbles is it's expense. They are by far the most expensive choice.\nLava Rock - Lava rock is another great choice because they are pH neutral, light weight, and have a large surface area. They are cheaper than clay pebbles, and you can often find it for free if you know where to look. The downside to lava rock is they can be rough on the hands and roots if you handle them too much.\nPea Gravel - The biggest advantage to pea gravel is it's much cheaper than the other alternatives. That said, pea gravel comes with many problems. Pea gravel has a smaller surface area than other choices, is heavier, doesn't hold moisture very well, and can have negative effects on your systems pH.\nAs you can see from the pictures, I decided to use lava rock in my own system. From my own personal experience this is a very good choice for aquaponics systems. An important step to take before adding the media to your grow bed is washing/rinsing it thoroughly. I used a 5 gallon bucket to do this.\nTake a 5 gallon bucket and drill several holes in the bottom for sediment and dirt to drain out of. Use a garden hose to spray off the media while you separate the clean media from the dirty media. Once the media is clean from dust and dirt, add it to the grow bed until you've filled it completely.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F91/3ZNN/JIYU73OL/F913ZNNJIYU73OL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1X/265V/JIYU73OJ/F1X265VJIYU73OJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS8/8M23/JIYU73OU/FS88M23JIYU73OU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR6/P2IX/JIYU73QC/FR6P2IXJIYU73QC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Q/HT46/JIYU73Q0/F8QHT46JIYU73Q0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Grow Bed Media"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Plants need a special kind of light to grow properly; you can't just turn on a lamp and call it good.

The pump and plumbing is working perfectly. Everything is looking good and you\u2019re ready to get things growing! This is an exciting moment, but don\u2019t be too quick to rush into growing just yet. The final stages of setting up your aquaponics system is making sure the chemistry is right. To do this we need to cycle the system, a process that takes ten days to a month to do.\nCycling is the process of establishing a healthy system that converts fish waste into healthy plant food (nitrates) effectively. To do this, your system needs to establish a healthy level of bacteria. In this process you will need a test kit to track water pH, ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates. You will also want to test water temperatures as well. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t need a degree in chemistry to do this. The process is very simple if you follow the steps and track the data religiously.\nFor this process you will need an aquarium test kit. I\u2019m using the API Freshwater Master Test Kit, sold on Amazon or at pet stores. You will also need a thermometer to check water temperatures. For this I used a cooking thermometer because I had it on hand already. You will also need ammonia to jump start the process. It must be pure ammonia. Look for this in the cleaning supplies section of your grocery store. Make sure it is pure; you will find two ingredients in it, water and ammonia. Make sure it doesn\u2019t have any added scents or coloring; I can\u2019t stress this enough.\nOnce you have everything you need you can start the process of cycling your aquaponics system as follows:\nMeasure out a small amount of ammonia (take note of how much was added) and add it to the tank until you obtain a reading 5 ppm. Make sure you are tracking temperature, pH, nitrites, and nitrates from day one.\nOn a daily basis, add that same amount of ammonia and continue to measure and record temperature, pH, nitrites, and nitrates until the nitrites show 0.5 ppm.\nOnce nitrites show 0.5 ppm, add only half the amount of ammonia you have been adding for the past couple of days. Continue to do this daily and remember to keep tracking your data.\nOnce nitrates appear ( between 5 and 10 ppm), and the nitrites have dropped back to 0, you can add your fish and stop adding ammonia to the system.\nFeel free to plant in the grow bed during the cycling process. Your plants will show some deficiency at first, but will help in getting your system up to appropriate levels to self regulate. After the cycling process your plants will begin to flourish. Fish should be added after the cycling process because the levels of ammonia during the process will more than likely kill them. Once the fish are added they will provide the ammonia naturally.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLJ/BFD5/JIYU73PB/FLJBFD5JIYU73PB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Cycling Your Aquaponics System"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "Adding plants to your indoor aquaponics system is very easy.

Some things to consider when choosing a fish are the size of the fish, pH tolerance, temperature tolerance, oxygen needs, dietary needs, and whether you yourself are planning on harvesting the fish down the road. I've provided a list of common fish to use in aquaponics and their requirements (see photos).\nIn my own system I decided to use Channel Catfish. I went with catfish for several reasons. First, I will be harvesting my own fish and I particularly enjoy the taste of fried catfish. Second, catfish have a high tolerance for colder climates and lower levels of oxygen; they are a very hardy fish. Third, they are extremely easy to feed. Catfish are omnivorous and require a good balance of plant and animal protein as well as plant based nutrients and amino acids. The cheapest food out there without sacrificing nutritional requirements I have found is cat food. It can\u2019t get any easier than that. On a side note, cat food is shaped and packed in a way that would make it optimal in an Automatic Fish Feeder.\nYou don\u2019t have to feel limited by fish if you would prefer a different route.

That being said there may come a time when your plants need a little extra boost. In such times I have a few tricks up my sleeve that are pretty effective. This step is completely optional, and is \"for your information\" only.\nBanana Tea - Banana tea is an organic potassium fertilizer that aids plants during times of flowering and fruiting. This is easy to make at home, and is completely safe to add to your aquaponics system. To make banana tea, chop up five banana peels and place them in a pot with one liter of water. Put the pot on the stove and boil for 15 minutes. Discard the banana peels and save the remaining water by straining the mixture over an empty container. Finally, add an additional two liters of water to the banana tea.\nEgg Shell Powder - Egg shell powder can help remedy calcium deficiency in your plants and raise pH levels. Save any egg shells you may normally discard until you have 12 - 24 egg shells. Make sure they are rinsed properly and allow them to dry. Put them in the microwave for a couple minutes to destroy any bacteria growing on the egg shells. Put the egg shells in a blender and blend them to a powdery consistency. Use this in your system as needed by sprinkling it into your grow beds.\nSeaweed Extract - Seaweed extract is another great additive to give your plants an added potassium boost along with other trace elements. First gather seaweed from the beach or shore and rinse it thoroughly. Fill a five gallon bucket with water (approximately 3/4 of the way up) and soak the seaweed in this bucket. Stir the seaweed every three to four days until you can no longer smell ammonia coming from the mixture. After a few weeks it should be ready to use. Discard any solids and add water to the remaining liquid to dilute (3 parts water to 1 parts seaweed extract).

A standout iconic crafting item to the series is the dart gun from Fallout 3, a pistol grip crossbow that shoots poison dipped darts to cripple your enemies and the mutant creatures that roam the earth post a nuclear war. It consists of the following items combined to form a dart gun according to the schematic you find in the game:\n-paint gun\n-toy car\n-surgical tubing\n-radscoripion poison gland\nAll this being said I don't have a use for a poison dart gun (not sure what sane person would), but I do like the styling with the retro toy car and the idea of reusing items to make something useful. I also have a dog named Bunk (a small version of the dog companion Dogmeat) who loves to fetch orange ChuckIt balls.

If you did the single piece wood method you would pull back the plunger and then ratchet it on top of the wood creating a hard stop. The advantage of the single piece wood method would be that you can use the plunger axle as a gun stock. However, I thought the two strip method looked better and it also gave me access to the center of the frame to have some modularity options later on.\nAnyways part 1:\n1. Get your caulking gun and measure the opening distance between the where the solid part of the frame ends and where the plunger ends. The goal is to press in 2 planks of wood into the frame opening.\n2.

With the holes marked use a hammer and center punch to make indentions at the center of each hole marker. This will prevent your drill bit from traveling.\n3. Get two clamps and fix your planks together, make sure they line up, there is no undo for drilling holes in the wrong place. By clamping the planks together you will ensure that the connecting holes line up to each other and it also means you only have to drill half as many holes.\n4. Use a drill press or hand drill to drill through the planks at the hole markers.

Make sure when you are choosing the caulking gun that the plunger of the caulking gun when fully engaged to the end of the gun allows you to pull the trigger and have the mechanism return back from the spring sandwiched between the trigger and the frame.\nThe main benefit of using the caulking gun is that it has a nice frame for to you to build the sling shot around. The downside is the trigger is never locked. When you attach the latex tubing to the top of the trigger you need enough counteracting force from the spring to hold the trigger in position or else the trigger will move forward and release the ball prematurely. This is why you will see that I added an extra spring to the gun to increase the force keeping the trigger fixed. You need to make sure that the gun will only fire when you pull the trigger.\nAlternatively you could reuse something else with a trigger. I used the caulking gun because I already had it and seemed like I could make it work. Maybe you could use a quick clamp or a paint gun like in the game. Ideally you would want something that stays fully locked until the trigger is pulled instead of the caulking gun where the trigger is unfixed and relies on you balancing counteracting forces.\nAnyways Part 1:\nYou need to make a supporting structure to hold the slingshot pocket (the part that holds the ball) loop in place connected to the trigger.\n1. The top part of the trigger for the caulking gun within the frame should be bent backwards providing a somewhat flat surface for you to modify. Mark and center punch the center of this flat surface of the trigger bracket. Drill a 1/4\" hole into the center of this flat surface.\n2. Acquire a 1/4\"-20 threaded rod 2-3/4\" long to insert into the 1/4\" hole you made. If you find that your slingshot paracord loop at the end of the satchel tends to slip off this rod then use a Dremel or hack saw to cut the sides off the head of a 1/4\"-20 bolt with a button head to create a threaded rod with essentially a hook on the end to provide a stronger hold on the loop.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9N/AEEM/JK8KC8OB/F9NAEEMJK8KC8OB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCS/F08F/JK8KC8OC/FCSF08FJK8KC8OC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F73/MAQ5/JKWUW176/F73MAQ5JKWUW176.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO6/9T6Y/JKWUW17K/FO69T6YJKWUW17K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKO/OA00/JKWUW17R/FKOOA00JKWUW17R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB0/IRRK/JKWUW17Y/FB0IRRKJKWUW17Y.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 12: Caulking Gun Modification Part 1: Trigger"}, {"step": 13, "steps_text": "Description:\nYou will most likely need extra spring force so you can make a sling shot with sufficient firing power to be fun, without modifiying it mine would only shoot about five feet before the trigger would just be pulled forward by the tension I was putting on the trigger with the stretched latex tubing.\nTo increase the amount of spring force that pushes the trigger backwards you can either swap out the original spring with something stiffer or do what I did and add a spring to the bottom of the trigger handle. By adding it to the bottom of the trigger handle you will increase the amount of leverage from adding an extra spring. The further from the pivot point you put the second spring the stronger the force will be pushing the trigger back. Just make sure that it is a manageable amount of force, you need to be able pull the trigger still with your hand to fire.\nPart 2 A, Extra Spring Trigger Handle Mounting:\n1. Clamp the caulking gun in a somewhat vertical position so the trigger handle is accessible.\n2. Mark about 3/4\" up from the end of the handle at the center of the curved trigger handle.\n3. If possible see center punch the center marker so your drill bit does not travel.\n4. Drill out the center hole stepping up drill bits until you can fit your 3/8\" bolt.\n5. Test the fit and adjust as needed.\nAlternatively you could JB Weld a long bolt onto the trigger handle or bolt on a bracket to move the spring even further down away from your hand / original trigger handle to increase your force even more and thereby increase your maximum firing force / potential energy limit.\nPart 2 B, Extra Spring Forward Frame Mounting:\n1. Mount your spring onto the trigger with your 3/8\" bolt and nut plus two washers.\n2. See how far you can stretch the spring towards the front of the gun then mark distance on the frame.

So I searched for timber playpens, which exist, but those cost hundreds more!\nWell I realised that I had 2 used IKEA Gulliver cots that would be perfect for the job.

If you don't already have them, I'm sure these are available as hand-me-downs in your neighbourhood or online for very cheap.\nThe Challenge: to convert these 2 cots into the largest playpen I could achieve, without drilling any new holes in the cots that would ruin the future re-assembly of the parts back into usable cots or toddler beds.\nThe Result: The 2 cots were originally 60x120cm (2'x4'), which yielded a 120x180cm playpen (4'x6'), which is about the size of a super-single adult bed.\nPlenty of space for my toddler to play and nap in, and even 1-2 adults can join him in there comfortably!", "title": "Supersized Toddler Playpen With Sliding Gate Out of Old IKEA Cots", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Supersized-Toddler-Playpen-With-Sliding-Gate-Out-o/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Here's a video overview I took after the playpen was complete, where I talk through the features of the playpen including the sliding gate.

They kinda look like turrets, so I was planning to cap them off with castle turret roofs or something later. But it's been over a year and I haven't gotten to that yet...\nThese 3-sided assemblies were slightly wobbly when constructed without the fourth side, so I added some plastic shelf brackets (also from IKEA) to stabilise them. Yes, I know these required some new screw holes, but that's ok because these are added to the original 'bottom' of the cot, so they will never be seen if I use these as a cot or toddler bed again.\nI put the two C-shaped assemblies facing each other, with a gap of about 60cm.

These had a travel of 60cm, which is plenty of space to get in and out.\nThe assembly of this was tricky, mostly because of my no-holes rule. I ended up adding a strip of pine timber across the bottom of the playpen, so that I could screw in the drawer track to that with as many screws as needed. This strip of timber was attached to the playpen through the existing holes in the playpen legs, plus additional zip-ties for reinforcement. This strip of timber became a threshold across the open side of the playpen, giving it the strength and rigidity needed.\nThe upper drawer track was installed offset compared to the bottom one, so that it doesn't obstruct the opening. Again I used an extra pine plank to screw the track to. It's hard to describe, so take a good look at the photos and the video too.\nFinally I added a sliding bolt on the outside of the door, to lock the playpen. I've added some foam padding to the catch side of the bolt after it gave my mum in law a nasty scratch.

The biological indicators that you will find in a healthy river ecosystem include mayfly larva, stonefly larva, caddisfly larva, dobsonfly larva, water pennies, and newts. A wide range of these organisms is a good sign. You can find these macroinvertebrates/amphibians by wading into the stream, picking up a rock, and looking closely at the underside. The macroinvertebrates will be clinging to the bottom of the rock to keep from being washed downstream.

When I did drive it to a new spot it cost about $100 a day, so not a cheap vacation vehicle. After leaving KOA the Bus lived in the back yard as a guest house. When I moved to a larger house it was just a storage area. Then the snakes and rats moved in so it was time to say Good Bye. I paid more to have it towed to Don's Auto Crushing than I paid for the Bus at the auction. At least Don gave a good metal scrap rate!\nIf I built today I would try to put in a mini-split air conditioner.\nI hoped you enjoyed the story of the Bus and the ideas may help you decide how to build your own tiny house.\nWrite if you have any questions.\nBest wishes, Carl.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBZ/0A6X/JKWUT2UG/FBZ0A6XJKWUT2UG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ2/FRO8/JKWUT2TE/FJ2FRO8JKWUT2TE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR6/PQ9X/JKWUT2YK/FR6PQ9XJKWUT2YK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM9/B294/JKWURBNU/FM9B294JKWURBNU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 11: Near the End"}], "channel": "Homesteading"}, {"category": "Home", "description": "In this instructable I am going to show you how I build this Batman wall art lamp.

These are here to prevent bedding from spilling over the edges. You will need: Two 23 5/16\u201d x 2 \u215c\u201d boards,and one 36\u201d x 2 \u215c\u201d board. Start by lining up the two short boards with the front of the floor, and hold them in place with clamps. Look at photo 2 as reference. Once you have done that, screw them in from the bottom using 3\u201d screws and a power drill. Screw in 3 screws on each board; one at each end, and one in the middle. Once you have both sides firmly attached take the 36\u2019\u2019 board and clamp it onto the back of the floor. There should be a gap along the back just the right size for the board to sit flush with everything. Screw it in using 4 screws total; one at each end, and two near the middle. Avoid putting screws at the very end of the boards, because the vertical \"legs\" will need to be attached there, and you'll have no where to screw them in.\nStep 3.3: After you have all of the walls in place, you need at least 4 tiles, a box cutter, a straight edge, carpenter's square, and a surface that is not easy to cut through (i.e., a thick piece of scrap wood). On the side of the tile that has the paper, trace a line the same height as the wall. An easy way to do this is to hold the tile against the wall where it's going to go, and trace the edge of the wall so you'll know where to cut to make the tiles flush with the walls. Use the box cutter to score a line and snap the tile. The printed part won\u2019t snap alone. So, place the tile on the wood at a right angle and cut the printed design. Once that is done, peel and stick the correct tiles in place. Also, you will find that the tile overlaps the full tile. When this happens draw a line where the overlay ends. Use the corner edge to draw a straight line to cut. Follow the same steps for the rest of the tiles. Next grab your clear caulk and go around the edges, corners and anywhere one tile ends and another one starts. Use water to smooth everything down. Make sure you also add some to the top of the wall to make sure the tiles stay. Make sure the caulk is well done and covering every crack so its sealed as much as possible. Follow the same steps for the second floor. Once all steps for the first and second floors are complete you have now completed the longest step.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FP0/A3EN/JKIKB541/FP0A3ENJKIKB541.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAR/XAPE/JKIKB523/FARXAPEJKIKB523.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Floors"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "What you need:\n(4) 48\u201d wood boards\n(4) 24\u201d wood boards\n(2) 33\u201d wood boards\nStep 4.1: The first thing you want to do for this is turn the two floors on their sides, 14 \u00bd \u201c apart.

Attach the hinges to the bottom of the baseboard (what was just screwed in), then have someone help you hold the door so you can attach the hinges to the doors.\nStep 5.2: Next, we used scrap wood to prevent the top door from going all the way in, and latches to hold the doors closed.

Draw a line in the middle of the square. Use wire cutters and cut along the line. Once cut, mark another piece the same size. Using wire cutters, cut off the ragged edges. At first we folded the wire over, but we found that cutting the edges off was a lot easier. This will leave a nice, neat finish that you won't cut yourself on. Staple one of the finished pieces onto the bottom shelf going up. Then staple the second piece on, overlapping by 2-3\u201d, the second piece will overlap onto the top of the cage. Bend the mesh over and staple it as flat as you can. Follow the same steps on the other side of the cage. For the top of the cage measure out one 35\u201d x 25\u201d piece using the same method as the walls. Once cut start stapling at one end and work down the cage, covering the overlap. Try your best to put staples on top of both layers. If a staple is sticking up to much, use a hammer to flatten it. The doors are the easiest. Measure out one 23 \u00bd\u201d x 25\u201d piece and cut it in half. Staple one half on the inside of the door, and the other half to the bottom door.

This will be the flat platform that the two ramps will attach to.\nStep 8.2: Measure and cut out (4) 6\u201d x 1.5\u201d, and (2) 8 1/2\u201d x 1.5\u201d boards. Start by attaching two of the 6\" boards to each end of the 8 1/2\u201d boards with 3\" screws using the square clamps, creating two \"C\" shapes that are 10\" x 6\". These are the legs, and will be attached to either end of the platform.\nStep 8.3: For the ramp angles and lengths, you can do whatever suits you and your furry friend. For us, we had drawn up several designs before settling on the one shown in the pictures. We then measured and cut (1) 13\u201d x 5\u201d board, and (1) 15 \u00bd\u201d x 5\u201d board to be the ramps. Trace a 5\" x 7\u201d rectangle on the second floor and cut out with a saw. If you want, use a circular bowl that is 5\u201d across the top, trace it and cut it out. There is a time lapse of this down below.\nStep 8.4: Place the platform in the cage where you want it, close to a back wall. Next cut out (1) 5\u201d x 1.5\u201d. Lay the shorter ramp piece in a way you that allows you to draw a line horizontal to the platform. Cut at that angle, or skip that step and leave the gap (you could cover it later). After that, take the 5\" piece and line it up horizontally with the platform. then trace an angled line and cut. It should fit under the smaller ramp. Screw the new piece into the platform with 3\" screws. then take the smaller platform and screw it into the the attachment with 3\" screws.\nStep 8.5: Lay the second ramp piece in the hole you cut, and draw another horizontal line to cut flush with the platform. Once both ramps are cut move onto the supports. For the taller one, screw tiny hinges onto the board attaching the ramp to the platform. Line it up with the top of the hole, and using 3\u201d screws, screw it in to the top floor's support joists. There may be a gap, but that's okay. With the bottom piece, we left the side that was going on the floor uncut. For the top piece, we used a piece of scrap wood and held it horizontally with the ramp and platform, and drew a line where to cut. Once it was cut, I screwed it into the platform, the I screwed the shorter ramp into the board.\nStep 8.6: The next (and final) step for the ramp is to add traction. We bought cheap rubber traction sheets, meant for normal staircases. They are way too big, so we traced where to cut and eventually covered the entire thing with the rubber. We used liquid nails and clamps to connect it to the wood. Make sure the traction is facing the way that allows your friend to climb up it. We left about an inch extra to overlap the top of the ramp so she would be easily able to climb up.\nWith those steps done, you\u2019re done with building!

This step is completely optional, we decide to do it because the bottom floor doesn't get nearly as much light as the top floor. We did the LEDs as our last step, but if you decide to do the LEDs your self, I would highly suggest doing them before the mesh is attached. This would give you full acsess to all walls.\nWhat you need:\nRazor\nLEDs: 16.4 ft, 5050 LED Rope, Full Kit with 44-keys IR Remote Controller & Power Supply\nLED connectors: 10 mm, 5050 LED Strip Light Connectors Kit\nStep 9.1: Measure out (2) 23 3/8\" pieces, and (1) 36\" piece. You can only cut on the spots that it tells you to, so cut the closest one. Using a razor, strip about a centimeter of the rubber coating from each end to expose the contacts. Tuck the copper contacts under the tabs in the connector. We used the straight connectors because the corner connectors where giving us a lot of trouble. Assemble all three pieces to fully test the lights. We used hot glue around all the edges of the connectors to ensure they wouldn't come loose during the next step.\nStep 9.2: To attach the LEDs, first attach the control box to the inside of the frame. Stick double sided tape to the back and stick it on. Then, run the black power cord out of the mesh, run it along the side and plug it in. Start in one of the corners, peeling all the paper off that side, and slowly work your way forward; pressing firmly against the LEDs until one side is fully attached. Next, unpeel about 4-5\" of the paper from the longest LED strip along the back and stick those LEDs on, repeating the process 4-5\" at a time until it is all firmly stuck on. Once that is done, follow the same steps to do the last side.\nAfter you have attached your LED's and finished everything else, you are ready to move your furry friend in!

I began by measuring and recording the layout of the room while visualizing what potential elements could go where after taking into consideration the doors, closet and windows. It's important to decide what wall will be the centerpiece of the room. The most logical selection here was the wall seen right as you enter the room. Pretty much everything grows from this place outward.\nI brought the room sketch and dimensions into Photoshop and proceeded to mock up the layout and positioning of the main elements of the room. Placing different components on separate layers allows you to quickly move, rearrange and tweak the positioning, scale, and relative placement of many elements. After the design was mostly decided upon, I proceeded to draw out a grid over top of the entire piece. A grid is a very helpful tool when dealing with reproducing images onto a large surface. Scaling elements properly and keeping everything aligned are a breeze using this classic method. For this particular grid, one 1.5\" square on the page (printed to scale) equaled one foot on the wall of the room.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQT/4IWG/JKIKC96A/FQT4IWGJKIKC96A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ6/LOCN/JKIKC95B/FZ6LOCNJKIKC95B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRY/C3L3/JKIKC95C/FRYC3L3JKIKC95C.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Assess, Visualize, Mockup"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Every big project starts with a first step and this was ours. Patching holes on the wall and painting the base coat of indoor latex paint. Tape up the windows/door frames, spread the drop cloths, and break out the paint rollers. We decided upon putting up chair rail molding to give the mural a base that was up closer to eye level. For a typical room with 8 foot ceilings, 32 inches is a pretty standard height. We applied a light blue for the sky and then painted a darker blue from the baseboards to the 32 inch level.

The Sun. Where was the primary light source in my scene? Since there was one window in this room, I decided that it was coming from the left. So from this point onward, I needed to keep this in the back of my mind.\n\nFluffy clouds were a perfect first item to begin painting...as there is no exact perfect way to paint them. You get to have fun with it. Very low stress. Try to make sure that the fluffy/curviest side of the clouds were facing and highlighted from the left side, my light source. Using a very small amount of white paint on a dry bristle brush, begin to paint the clouds. Use a light touch to start and more pressure as you run out of paint so you achieve a fairly even and light application of paint. Work your brush in a circular motion to create the fluffy edges of the clouds.\n\nNow to break out the grids. It may be necessary to subdivide the grids even further based on parts of your reference images. Lightly sketch out some large grid lines on your walls based on your layout. The primary use of the grid in my mural was to help insure I maintained all of the perspective and correct proportions of Princess Peach's castle and other large key elements. As you sketch, keep looking where parts of the reference image coincide with corners in the grids. Rinse and repeat. Make your sketches light enough where they can be easily erased if they need to be tweaked a bit.\n\nAs far as painting, besides the blue background, I used acrylic paints and just a handful of brushes. Work from the background forward, trying to not focus on many of the smaller details until the base shapes and such are in place. As I started in on the detail for the castle, I kept the light source constantly in mind. Patience and listening to some good tunes helps a lot! The castle took quite a long while, painting all of the highlights on the bricks, but it ended up adding another layer of realism that is hard to discount.

At the time of this project, one could post game screenshots within Miiverse (Nintendo's social media attempt for the WiiU).

Get Some Good Ones!"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "In Mario Kart 8, a key feature of the game is the introduction of inverted tracks. At many points in many levels, the racetrack can twist and turn all over the place. I wanted to somehow represent and capture this new and exciting feature in an unexpected way. Having the track flow up along the ceiling and suspending a big model of Mario and his Kart upside down seemed like a good idea at the time.... Let me generally run you through the build.\n\nMaking such a model could easily be pieced together using a 3D printer, but at the time, I didn't own one, so traditional sculpting was my only choice. Just as with the room, it was critical to have good references. This was a brand spanking new game at the time, and there were no physical examples of the new Kart design to go off of yet. Luckily for me, Nintendo and McDonald's just released the new vehicles in Happy Meals! So after obtaining the new Kart, a small Mario figure and taking some close up pics from the front and the side, I returned to Photoshop.\n\nA classic drawing and sculpting technique for creating characters is to break it down into character \"heads\". Using the character's head as a base unit of measure, how many heads tall and heads wide is it? In Photoshop, I overlayed boxes representing Mario's head from different perspectives and was able to figure out his relative proportions. From knowing how large I wanted the entire sculpture to be, using calipers, I was able to establish a relationship between the small toy and the large model that was yet to be built.\n\nThe primary building material of both Mario and his Kart is 2-inch thick blue DOW insulation foam. (His head and hat are different and I will get to those later) This stuff was a bit challenging to track down in my area, but I eventually found it at a building supply company in a 4x8 sheet. Carefully start by cutting the foam down into the rough sizes you need with a hacksaw blade and an assortment of metal rasps and files. (WARNING: This is MESSY! :) ) Joining several pieces together was accomplished by lightly spraying each surface with 3M spray adhesive and letting it sit for a minute to tack up. This type of glue likes to eat away at the foam, which was admittedly not ideal, but very light applications it was fine. For combining larger pieces, I occasionally used wooden bamboo skewers in addition to the adhesive to help provide more support. After repeated checking with calipers, and some artistic liberties, I was finally happy with the foam variants of Mario's body and his kart.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTK/AY53/JKIKCTBL/FTKAY53JKIKCTBL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS0/D5Q6/JJT6L4IW/FS0D5Q6JJT6L4IW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9U/VWCU/JJT6L4J0/F9UVWCUJJT6L4J0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ0/ZV02/JJT6L3YQ/FQ0ZV02JJT6L3YQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7E/WRCZ/JJT6L404/F7EWRCZJJT6L404.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFI/AV32/JKN8QLCH/FFIAV32JKN8QLCH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB6/J1WI/JKIKCTAL/FB6J1WIJKIKCTAL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXF/55HF/JKIKCTCJ/FXF55HFJKIKCTCJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDC/RNDZ/JKIKCTE4/FDCRNDZJKIKCTE4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Foam Model Building"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "After getting your foam model just right, it is time to get that tough ceramic-like shell going. This is accomplished by using a two part modeling compound known as Apoxie Sculpt. Apoxie Sculpt is extremely versatile and easy to work with. It has a 1-3 hour working time (depending on ambient temperatures), doesn't generate noxious fumes, and is quick to clean up just using soap and water.\n\nBegin by mixing equal parts of part A and B together. Knead together for two minutes until thoroughly combined and a uniform color is achieved. Only retrieve and mix enough of the compound for the area you are currently working on. Press and smooth out the putty onto the surface of the foam. Having a small cup or bowl of water nearby is handy for getting your fingers wet. This helps immensely with getting this material to spread out easily. You can even employ a scraper to help smooth out larger areas.\n\nAfter 24 hours, it will be completely cured and rock solid, able to be sanded, filed, carved, drilled, tapped, or painted.

For Mario's head and hat, they were to be sculpted in clay, molded in silicone and cast in resin. The ability to possibly reuse the silicone molds in other projects was very appealing and helped me make the decision to go in this direction.\n\nClay Sculpting\nThe clay used for Mario's head and hat is called Monster Clay, which is apparently very popular with special effects houses and in the toy industry. It is an amazing sulfur free & oil based clay which means it never dries out and can be softened/melted down in a microwave over and over again. (It can even be poured into a mold itself and used to cast with, then you sculpt from there!) At room temperature it holds its shape and can be worked with your hands or any traditional sculpting tools. Using the clay, start out with big forms and refine the shapes while looking at your reference. I was utilizing a small Mario figurine as my reference, and broke out the calipers a few times during the process to check relative sizes. Just as with previous sculpting steps, it may be easier to break the entire item into measurable chunks. Before we used \"heads\" as the standard unit of measure...here we can use the character's eyes as the unit of measure. So on the smaller reference model, using calipers, get the dimensions of an eye. Now determine how many \"eyes\" wide and tall the head and face should be. Also as before, wait until the larger shapes are well established before working on smaller details. To help smooth out larger sections you can lightly brush on mineral spirits or even use a lighter/torch(I have seen this done but not tried it myself)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F56/Y0GI/JKIKGE35/F56Y0GIJKIKGE35.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F49/JG2E/JKIKG28O/F49JG2EJKIKG28O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ8/X8XV/JKN8QN5T/FQ8X8XVJKN8QN5T.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Sculpting Mario's Head and Hat"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "The next step in the process is to use silicone rubber to make a hopefully exact copy of Mario's head. Essentially, we are going to brush on and coat the clay head with silicone with the exception of the very top of his head where his hat would sit. Basically, we are making a giant silicone glove that can be peeled away, leaving a negative copy. There are several different approaches one could use for making such a large item, but I elected to use a technique called slush casting. This is popular for casting things that are meant to be hollow such as StormTrooper helmets! The advantage of this method is that it uses much less resin in your reproduction which makes it both lighter and cheaper than filling the mold entirely with expensive resin.\n\nApplying the Silicone\nAfter fully smoothing out Mario's face and identifying any big undercuts were the silicone could get snagged up, we start the silicone process. This can be very runny and messy so make sure to lay out some newspaper to catch the drippings. The specific silicone used on this project was PlatSil 71-20 from Brick in the Yard Mold Supply. This material comes in parts A and B and needs to be combined in equal parts, measured by weight. It is best to get a cheap digital scale to easily measure out your two parts accurately. After pouring equally weighted amounts in two cups, mix them together in a separate larger container. It is extremely important to thoroughly combine parts A and B, making sure to scrape the sides and bottoms of the cup to get every last bit mixed. This material has a 25 minute working time, so no need to rush. When you are convinced you have well blended silicone, using a cheap brush, apply it to the model. Make sure to use the brush and work it into any cracks and detailed areas such as around his mustache. Again, you are going to want the silicone to be applied everywhere, except on the top of his head, where the hat will cover. This will later form the opening where we will pour our resin in for slushcasting. After the first layer cures (about 4-5 hours), go ahead and add some more. In the end you want your silicone to be about 1/8\" thick. Do not be concerned about how it looks at this point, as it's likely to appear quite messy such as mine above! The real magic is on the inside! The final touch with the silicone is to apply what are called registration keys to your model. These are bits of silicone that protrude from the surface that help with aligning the next step in the molding process. Several silicone suppliers have ice cube like trays to make your own keys. In the next step, we will have a seam from the top of Mario's forehead down to his chin, continuing underneath until it reaches the back of his head, where the hat will meet his hair. In this area, do not put any registration keys, but distribute them around around 2-3 inches away from each other.\n\nMother Mold Creation\nWhen thinking back to the glove analogy, imagine said rubber glove is a perfect silicone mold of your hand. After removing the glove and placing it on the table, it collapses and flops over under its own weight. It does not correctly hold the shape/volume of your hand under its own weight. That is where the mother mold comes in. It is basically a rigid hand cast that is formed around the glove. The glove is attached with the registration keys into the mother mold to ensure it is in the exact right place to be able to cast the correct shape.\n\nA hand cast comparison couldn't be closer to the truth, as the mother mold is literally plaster bandages used in casts that wrap around the silicone creating a two part rigid outer shell! Like an exoskeleton! Depending on the plaster bandages, you may need to precut the material into manageable strips. Fill a bucket of water and quickly submerge the bandage into the water. Allow the excess water to drip off of the bandage, then apply the bandage following along that imaginary seam from the forehead down underneath and up along the back of the head. Allow the bandage to overlap this seam about 1 - 1.5 inches all the way around. Continue to cover that one hemisphere of Mario's head, but remember to leave the hole along the top of the head where it will meet the hat. (I did this step with the head upside down, so it was sitting on the top of head) These bandages will begin to harden surprisingly quick, so don't dawdle! Be sure to form the bandages around the registration keys. This creates a unique point where each key exists so the silicone will be able to lock into the mold in just the right spot.\n\nSilicone has a cool property that it only likes to stick to silicone. So you do not have to apply anything to the silicone first before the bandages, such as a release agent. Before applying the bandages to form the second half of the mother mold, apply vaseline to the bandage along the 1 - 1.5\" overlap along the seam. This will insure that the two halves of the mother mold will not stick to each other and can be separated. Continue to cover the second half of the head, still remembering to leave a hole on the top of the head.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1W/LMUT/JKMUHUKF/F1WLMUTJKMUHUKF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8B/IJRF/JKMUHUKC/F8BIJRFJKMUHUKC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPZ/K8BF/JKIKG27X/FPZK8BFJKIKG27X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVG/F3BO/JKIKG276/FVGF3BOJKIKG276.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3M/F67E/JKIKG26A/F3MF67EJKIKG26A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPF/ET0B/JKMUHUKA/FPFET0BJKMUHUKA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMR/NLOZ/JKMUHUK9/FMRNLOZJKMUHUK9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJL/Y74J/JKMUHUJO/FJLY74JJKMUHUJO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6I/HEAW/JKMUHUJN/F6IHEAWJKMUHUJN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX0/PVT9/JKIKG275/FX0PVT9JKIKG275.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Molding With Silicone"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "After the last bandage has dried and cured, it is time for the real fun to begin, removing the clay master sculpt, and casting the resin copy!\n\nBegin by carefully prying apart the two halves of the mother mold. Once they are removed, you can begin to peel off the silicone like a glove. Slow down if there are areas that end up getting snagged, to minimize the damage if that occurs. The original clay sculpt should now be free! Turn the silicone mold back right side out and match up the registration keys where they lock into the mother mold. If it all goes to plan, you should get back to where you started this page, minus the giant clay Mario head inside. Using some large elastic bands or bungee cords, wrap up the mother mold so that it doesn't want to come apart.\n\nNow for the resin. For this project I used EasyFlo 120 casting resin by Brick in the Yard Mold Supply. It has a super fast working time of only about 2 minutes. It is specifically designed for roto casting or slushcasting. Using graduated measuring cups, pour equal amounts (only a few ounces or so) of parts A and B, this time measuring by volume instead of weight with the scale. The idea is that you mix up one small batch at a time, and pour each batch inside of the silicone mold. You continue to rotate and roll the mold around, slushing it around inside. As you approach the 2 minute working time limit, the resin will start to turn into an opaque white and stop flowing. This is when you pour in another little batch and continue this process. Over time, the resin will build up to your desired thickness(between 1/16' and 1/8\"). After about 25 minutes, you can can demold your duplicated Mario head! The end result is a hollow and lightweight yet very durable shell, while minimizing waste.\n\nThis entire process is just repeated to create his hat.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6I/RSXU/JKMUHVOE/F6IRSXUJKMUHVOE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYL/GF08/JKMUHVNL/FYLGF08JKMUHVNL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDB/ABKN/JKMUHVCG/FDBABKNJKMUHVCG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSO/HDGD/JKN8OKAE/FSOHDGDJKN8OKAE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZL/AG6B/JKN8OK9L/FZLAG6BJKN8OK9L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM9/JPPV/JKN8OKAJ/FM9JPPVJKN8OKAJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDW/ZMBT/JKIKG26D/FDWZMBTJKIKG26D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXL/0V1V/JKN8OKAK/FXL0V1VJKN8OKAK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMK/OG9T/JKIKG26C/FMKOG9TJKIKG26C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6H/YCRE/JKIKG269/F6HYCREJKIKG269.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Resin Casting"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "For the paint, I primarily used various brands of rattle cans for the primer and colors.

These can be easily cut to length along specific points and can be wired up via soldering or using clips. A simplified wiring diagram is available above. There was a 12 main line running down the underside of the kart. Each branch off of it is wired in parallel, to maintain 12V going to each wheel, bumper etc. The actual amount of LEDs varies based on how many fit into that spot, ranging from 3 for the bumper to around 15 for each wheel. These were all hot glued in position and the bright light was diffused by strips from a thin white cutting board mat! This is my go-to material for spreading out the light into a nice glow.

(design files available above). After cutting the treads out, I heated up water not quite to a boil to heat-form the plastic. Using cyanoacrylate (super glue) worked well at fusing the ends together forming a circle. There were some areas where they met that had larger gaps to be filled. For this, I also applied the superglue but sprinkled in some baking soda. Baking soda absorbs the glue and instantly cures it. This is a great tactic for filling in gaps or fillets and resulting in a super strong bond. Any irregularities can be easily filed off and sanded smooth. I also used some leftover Apoxie Sculpt in areas to help sculpt and finish more of the hubcap sections.

Now for some of the finishing touches! I wanted to extend the tiled/checkerboard grass out onto the ceiling to raise the wow factor even more. After scouring the internet for different solutions, I settled on 10X10\" fake grass squares from Michael's craft stores. These ended up being quite expensive, even with coupons, but in the end I think it was worth it. They were easy to trim with a large pair of scissors and light enough to be stapled right up to the ceiling drywall. Trimming and fitting as I went, I tried to maintain the curve of the tapering road.\n\nThe tapering road continues until it terminates at the Mario Kart game case that the entire room was based upon, Mario Kart 8. This was the best solution I could come up with to explain where the road was going, and how Mario ended up on the ceiling.\n\nSince the beginning, I wanted to display the chronology of the Mario Kart series on the walls in some way, and I was able to figure out how to integrate it into the logic of the room to justify their existence. The boxes are help up with the help of steel screws driven into the drywall and some magnets on the inside of the boxes. In this way, no box was harmed in the making of this nursery.\n\nLuckily, the final step of mounting Mario was not too difficult. I had easy access to the attic above and was able to determine where the ceiling joists were located. With this information, I was able to securely attach Mario and his Kart to the ceiling using heavy duty lag bolts. The entire sculpture is surprisingly light, thanks to the majority of it being made out of insulation foam.\n\nMuch of this project was an excuse for me to try out new processes, materials and techniques, such as resin casting, silicone molding, monster clay sculpting, LED strip wiring, foam sculpting and so much more. There are many elements here that could easily be a standalone Instructable on it's own. I hope this instructable inspires you to peek a bit out of your comfort zone and take a run at a project, even a dauntingly large one such as this. Just break it down into smaller individual goals.

In this instructable, I explain how I made these jars out of glass bottles.\nHere are the main reasons why I made this project:\nTo have more jars. Instead of buying some food packed into plastic and cartons, I am buying in bulk. But once bought, I need to stock my food... And therefore I need jars!\nBecause I have many glass bottles left, mainly from fruit juice I drink. So it is a nice way to reuse these old bottles.\nIt is pretty. Using bottles as jars is quite aesthetic.\nI was curious about cutting glass bottles.\n\nMain steps:\nRemove the labels.\nCut the bottles.\nSand the edges.\nMake the joints.\nGlue the joints.\nAdd text/image on the bottles.\nMaterials:\nHot water + container to place the bottle entirely + washing-up liquid + stainless steel sponge.\nA glass cutter // a rope // a bottle cutter (recommended) + a candle + ice cubes.\nI used my 3D printer for the joints, but I think it could be done with cork. And if you don't have a 3D printer, you can contact the nearest fablab or use an online service.\nA hot glue gun.\nA utility knife + transparent sticking paper // etching cream.\nYou can download the files to 3D print by clicking here!\nAlso, before to start I would like to point out that I used 3D printed pieces (with PLA) and hot glue for this project. While most of the food stored in these jars will be in contact with the glass only, I am not sure if PLA and hot glue are completely food safe. I have searched for hours on the internet for food safe glue (to stick the 3D printed pieces) and varnish (to apply on the PLA), but I was not satisfied enough. I also contacted many shops (for craft and tinkering) but none said they have food safe glue and varnish. I store my food in these jars for now anyway, but if you know an interesting food safe glue/varnish I could use, please drop a comment below and start a discussion :)\nYou might also be interested in some of my other 'ibles!

I found the following video, which is quite interesting and proposes 5 different ways to cut glass bottles.\nI tried 3 methods:\nWith a glass cutter.\nWith a rope.\nWith a bottle cutter (highly recommended).\nBe aware that if you use the glass cutter and the bottle cutter, a light score is enough to cut the bottle. During my first tries, I made the mistake to score multiple time at the same place, and I think it damaged both the cutting wheels and the bottle. Check the last gif of this step to see the kind of score you want to make.\nAnd honestly, the bottle cutter is the best technique. It makes smooth and straight scores on the bottle, and the cut is perfect.\nStarting from this step, I advise using gloves, sleeves, and safety goggles because you could get hurt with the glass. There is usually no problem, but if something goes wrong, it is better to be protected.\n#1 With a glass cutter\nFirst, I tried to cut the bottle manually with a bottle cutter as follow:\nI scored a line with the cutter all around the bottle.\nI placed the bottle in cold water.\nThen in hot water.\nAnd I repeated these 2 last steps until the glass broke.\nBut the first step was really difficult and I had to try several times until I made a straight line all around the bottle. And the cut was not straight.\n#2 With a rope\nThen I tried with a rope as explained in the video above.\nStuff I used:\nZip ties.\nTape (to stick the zip ties to the bottle).\nA rope.\nHot water.\nCold water.\nHow I proceeded:\nI used 2 zip ties to delimitate where I wanted to cut the bottle.\nI used tape to fix the zip ties to the bottle so they do not move.\nI scored a line with the glass cutter between the zip ties (about 1 cm long).\nI wrapped the rope around the bottle 3 times.\nAnd I moved the rope to create friction on the bottle.\nAfter less than 2 minutes the bottle breaks between the zip ties. In fact, during this process, the friction of the rope increases the temperature of the bottle which breaks. If it does not break after friction, place the bottle in cold water, and the change of temperature will help to cut the bottle.\n#3 With a bottle cutter (my favorite method)\nFor this method you need the following:\nA bottle cutter (obviously).\nA candle.\nIce cubes.\nHow to proceed:\nAdjust the length of the bottle cutter, so the line is scored where you want.\nPress the bottle and rotate.\nThen place it above a candle to heat the score.\nAnd place an ice cube on the same line.\nOn the following gif, you can see how I made the score.\nAnd on the following gif, you can see how I cut the bottle. As you can see it has been really quick (about 2 minutes starting from the scoring until the glass break), the cut was really neat and the top of the bottle detached quite easily. If it does not detach, repeat the steps with the candle and the ice cube.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FB1/LUFA/JJZN5JYD/FB1LUFAJJZN5JYD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCX/D5BH/JJZN5JYK/FCXD5BHJJZN5JYK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYI/HF1S/JKIKD603/FYIHF1SJKIKD603.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0N/RT3U/JJLKZXNW/F0NRT3UJJLKZXNW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Cut the Bottle"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Once the bottles are cut, the edges are quite sharp.

I used the simple joints and added hinges.\nScrews.

I wanted to save the existing pantry and solve my problems rather than do any major demo and remodel work. Mounting them on french cleats gave me adjustability and a practical and simple install. Splitting the shelves in to 3 segments gave me additional flexibility.

The recess in the center was to make items easy to reach, but the shelves were full depth on the edges to make the most use of the space covered by the wall and door trim. Make sure to take detailed measurements at multiple heights and depths - it's rare that closets and pantries are square. I learned the hard way.\nEverything was designed in Fusion 360 and my files are attached. Note that the full laid out file has some spare parts, and is split into 3 foot, 3 foot and 2 foot sections. I don't have a truck, so I have to design around the largest section of plywood I can fit in my car.\nCutting was interesting. For the first time we pushed our CNC Router Parts Pro 4x8 machine hard to see what it could do, and we were very impressed with the results. We ran a feed rate of 200 inches per minute, with a maximum cut depth of .375 for the rabbets I cut (one pass) and .35 for the rest (3 passes). The whole sheet was cut in about 40 minutes. Two full sheets were cut.\nYou are responsible for your own design and cam work. Know the limits of your machine and design for the equipment you have. This would not be practical on a smaller CNC, but may be doable with some design changes.\nA CNC router is not the only way to do this!

The first tool you\u2019ll need is a jack. Every vehicle has its own dedicated jack, but if for whatever reason yours is missing, I suggest using this type of jack. Get one that is more than able to support the weight or your vehicle. I\u2018m no \u201csafety sally\u201d but getting squashed under a car is something no one wishes for. Most sedans and light trucks nowadays weight in at around 4000lbs or 1800 kilos and seeing 1 ton is equal to 2200lb or 1000 kilos, you\u2019ll be needing a minimum of 2 tons.\nYou\u2019ll be needing some jack stands as well. Without these you\u2019d be relying only on your jack which isn\u2019t really safe, that\u2019s why you\u2019ll wanna have at least 1 handy. Also, have some wheel chucks handy, you'll be needing them.\nNext up is are the different tools that could be used to remove and reinstall your wheel.\nIf you want to keep things on a budget, I suggest using a long breaker bar. You could get these on special for 25$ Canadian and they do the job just fine but require a little elbow grease compared to the next tool, the air impact gun. The pneumatic impact gun is what\u2019s typically used in a home installation since air compressors are readily available to any homeowner. This method is quick, effortless and inexpensive. A good air gun/compressor combo could set you back around 200$ if you buying used so this could be a good choice. And finally, my favorite of them all, the cordless impact. These guns pack a punch and have no wire, they run off of batteries but cost close to 500$ so go ahead and choose what\u2019s best for you.\nAnd the last tool is a torque wrench. A torque wrench is important seeing you want your nuts and bolts torqued to spec. If you aren\u2019t sure about your vehicle\u2019s torque specs, check your owner\u2019s manual, they often list the more common ones such as wheels, brakes etc...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F43/R28O/JK8KCDU7/F43R28OJK8KCDU7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F01/2LOA/JK8KCDUC/F012LOAJK8KCDUC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYC/UM2R/JK8KCDUE/FYCUM2RJK8KCDUE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4T/EA97/JK8KCDV2/F4TEA97JK8KCDV2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ6/VQ44/JK8KCDUF/FQ6VQ44JK8KCDUF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJU/HM5C/JK8KCDUI/FJUHM5CJK8KCDUI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F19/4HWE/JK8KCDUJ/F194HWEJK8KCDUJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9O/VOJY/JK8KCDUT/F9OVOJYJK8KCDUT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4Y/OTVB/JK8KCDUM/F4YOTVBJK8KCDUM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F74/RYKP/JK8KCDUS/F74RYKPJK8KCDUS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR4/2CPS/JK8KCDUU/FR42CPSJK8KCDUU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK5/TNNO/JK8KCDUV/FK5TNNOJK8KCDUV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAC/PPKJ/JK8KCDUY/FACPPKJJK8KCDUY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: TOOLS/MATERIALS FOR THE PROJECT"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The first thing you\u2019ll wanna do is chuck the 2 wheels you won\u2019t be working on.

Once you're comfortable with the soldering process, grab your electrical wire and strip the plastic envelope to expose all the wires.

Make sure to overlap the wire about \u00bc\u201d of an inch on both sides to make sure you cover the damaged portion correctly.\nOnce the hole is covered, join both ends of the wire and twist it just like this to make sure it doesn\u2019t come undone while soldering.\nYou\u2019re now ready to solder, add some flux on the wire and start heating everything up. You\u2019ll wanna use a low flame for this or else you\u2019ll just burn off the flux.
