There are a lot of substitutions you can make for tools, but each tool makes the job easier!\n+ Ruler/straightedge - there's no substitute for a good ruler and straightedge. I like mine to be clear, so I can get the most precise cuts I can.\n+ Knife - I use an X-Acto knife, and sometimes just a single sided razor blade. The X-Acto does a great all-around job.\n+ Pricking irons - this tool makes the holes that the stitching will join. An awl and ruler can substitute, but the even spacing in the pricking irons makes it much easier to get consistent spacing.\n+ Groover - this makes grooves to tell me where to put the stitch holes. Can be substituted with a pencil and ruler, but the groover makes it so much easier!\n+ Contact cement - this acts as glue to hold to leather together during stitching, but also prevents the edges from separating during normal use. Not necessary, but helps things look nice.\n+ Needles and thread - I use between 2 and 4 needles, and waxed polyester thread. Definitely necessary!\n+ Beeswax and burnishing tool - Edge burnishing essentially polishes the edges of the wallet, and makes it look refined. Beeswax keeps it together and looks even more shiny!\n+ Mallet - I use the mallet to hammer the pricking irons through the leather.\n+ Leather - This is Chestnut Buttero leather from Conceria Walpier in Italy.

The needles are threaded through the hole, and then that needle pierces the thread about an inch from the end. This holds the thread on the needle during stitching without a knot.\nTo begin, I pull one needle through my first hole, and make sure the thread length on either side is equal (pics 2, 3).

I hope you are excited to get started with weaving!\nToday, you're gonna learn a technique called coiling technique. One of the four main basketry waving techniques. Also known as African weaving style.\nI am Ana and I'm the person behind this instruction. I am very excited to introduce you to this technique!\nCoiling technique is an easy technique to follow, especially if it is done in one color. By following it, we are going to make a continuous spiral that is going to be the basic form of our brooch.\nTo get started with weaving this brooch you're going to need very few materials and approximately 2.5 hours. You don't need a loop!\nMATERIAL:\nsynthetic rope,\nraffia,\na needle,\na lighter\nbrooch needle,\nand beads of any kind you like.\nA ROPE: The brooch is not supposed to be very big, that's why the rope shouldn't be very thick. The thickness I suggest is 6-7 mm so we can form 3.5 rounds of a circle, ending with the with of a spiral of 5 cm. Sometimes the end of a rope can be very messy. Before starting, cut the end of the rope and heat it with a lighter around the edge. The heat is going to melt the long threads and make the end a bit harder and less messy.\nA NEEDLE: The needle you are going to need is any needle with a big eye but if you are not so careful generally, please, avoid needles with a sharp ending and instead use a needle without it.", "title": "Brooch Weaving", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Brooch-Weaving/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "To start a spiral take the rope and place it on the table. It is good to sit at the table while you're weaving in order for your hands to have more space and can move freely backward and forward.\nTake a piece of raffia and put its end 2-3cm inside the rope, opposite of the end of the rope. Now, start wrapping the rope with raffia going from you and to the front until you wrap 5-6 cm and can form a small spiral. The spiral should be big enough so you can easily hold it. Pay attention as the shorter spiral has a tendency to unroll and is very difficult to hold. In the beginning, you are going to feel tension and spasm in your fingers but be patient, after you secure your spiral it is going to be much easier to maneuver it.

For securing a spiral you need a little bit of patience in the start.\nHold the spiral with your left hand ( if left handed), the raffia should be hanging down from the outside edge of the spiral.\nPut raffia string, from underneath, in between the first, outer circle, and the middle one. Now raffia is in between two circles of the spiral. Go over the middle circle to the middle hole of the spiral. Then, from underneath, go with the needle up, again in between these two circles. After you go up and over the outer circle you are going to appear in the same position as when you started securing the spiral. Now, from underneath go with your needle up, in between the circles. You have formed number 8 around the ropes. This is going to be our security stitch. If you feel that the secured point is not enough strong repeat the 8 stitch. If you are satisfied, just go over the rope out from your body and you will appear in the same position as when you started securing the spiral.\nNow, we will continue the 8 stitch as many times as possible, not in the same spot but going from the outside in the center and from the center towards you and back. Repeat this many times and you are slowly going to see the difference in how strong the spiral became.\nOnce when you are satisfied with the result, go to our starting position from this step, and continue wrapping the coil. You will probably need to wrap 6-7 times. Then it will be the time for another 8 stitch to secure your spiral.\nAfter every 6-7 wraps, you will do the 8 stitch.\nTIPS:\n-when you start making your spiral maybe the rope is going to be seen in the middle.

Depending of the thickness of the yarn, I use between 2 and 6 threads. The ideal amount in my opinion is 3 strands of DK (like DROPS Karisma). I needed to feel in my hands what quantity worked well, and I tried to get that feeling for warp and weft of each square. Then, my only concern was about colors.\nI dived into my stash of old school, ugly, lablelless balls of yarn, and made boxes by color. I had only one rule when weaving for this project : use only one color for the group of thread composing the warp/weft, or not too contrasting colors.\nWeaving those squares is a great memory for me. First, I chose the colors for warp and weft, with a little universe in my mind. I then warped the loom with the first color, and finally I looked the colors mixing together while weaving. It is comtemplative and very concrete at the same time, the perfect combo for me. One square is done in half an hour after a bit of training. Finished squares carry all the vibrations I felt when thinking of my universe of colors. It is very difficult for me to stop touching them, watching them, comparing the choices I made for this or that square... I find it irresistibly fascinating.\nIn the beginning, I was weaving only for colors.

You have now 6 rows (or 3 ridges) of garter stitch, with right side facing you. Take the square to join and place it ahead of your work, wrong side facing you. In other word, the two squares are right sides together. Insert your right needle into the first bound off stitch from the square to join, then into the first stitch on your left needle. Knit one stitch through the two stitches, the one from your knitting then the one from the square to join. You got one stitch on your right needle.\nRepeat : *Insert your right needle into the next bound off stitch from the square to join, then into the first stitch on your left needle. Knitone stitch through the two stitches. There are 2 stitches on your right needle. Pass the first stitch over the stitch you just worked. There is one stitch on right needle*.\nRepeat from * to * until there is only one stitch remaining on the right needle. Cut the yarn, pass the end into the loop and pull to secure.\nJoin the twelve square of one stripe into a long stripe, do it for the twelve stripes. Then, do the same to join the stripes together. Pick up 21 stitches per square and 3 per garter stitch border (one stitch per ridge), which makes 285 stitches to pick up along one stripe.\nI also added a border of 6 ridges of garter stitch (12 rows) around the whole blanket.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMR/YDB5/JTCSOUH0/FMRYDB5JTCSOUH0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA6/JI1E/JTCSOU5A/FA6JI1EJTCSOU5A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUX/79E1/JTCSOXV7/FUX79E1JTCSOXV7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Joining the Blanket Together"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Because this project wasn't enormous enough, I decided to line it with some white polar fleece.

And, there is the select group of projects I simply know I am going to make, no matter how much time goes over actually getting to it.\nFour years ago, I saw this wonderful instructable. It lead to me getting a few amazing pieces of wood, and following the project to make a pendant. I knew I wanted to use the other pieces to turn into my own version.\nNow, that is where it got a bit tricky. I wanted to use wirework, but everything I thought of felt like a mismatch to the material. Again and again I came back to the original project, rereading the introduction. Most important for me was to be able to come up with a design that fit the original thought behind it, yet also putting my own style into it.\nSeeing the remix contest pass by sparked the concept again in my head. Out of nowhere, I knew what to make of it - two circles, of which the inner one could spin around. Yeah. So, I sawed out a rough shape, took a piece of sanding paper, and went outside to enjoy the weather while sanding the outer ring. While walking, I realised how interesting the slight curve of the material was, and a new concept was born - using it in a bracelet rather than a pendant, fitting against my arm, some macrame for the bracelet.

Take one folded piece with opening at top and fold towards yourself.\n4. Take second strip, open the crease to make a loop with end of strip to the right.\n5. Slide first strip into second to make a T shape.\n6. Take third strip with end towards yourself and open crease and slide second strip through it.\n7. Take last strip with end to the left md open the crease sliding the third strip through.\n8. Take the fourth strip ends and slide both through your first strip of paper opening at crease.\n9. Slide and the pieces towards center.\nBOOM- you should have a little woven box\n10. Take the top left strip and fold down over square and crease.\n11.
