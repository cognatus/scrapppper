However, I\u2019m most happy to write about the Asparagus densiflorus \u201cMeyersii\u201d, for those of you who geek out on botanic names, anytime because it makes me happy. It\u2019s easy on the eyes and requires almost zero attention from me \u2013 a winning combo in my horticultural book. Plus, as it ages, the fronds (stems) gets a bizarrely delightful, twisting form and it reminds me of Medusa\u2019s serpent filled head.", "title": "An Easy Care & Fun Fern: Myers or Foxtail Fern", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/An-Easy-Care-Fun-Fern-Myers-or-Foxtail-Fern/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I learned this plant as Myers Fern.

However, the soil in my back yard is not on the acidic side & my Myers Fern is doing just fine. Plants can be that way, sometimes they stretch the limits. Fertilizer I\u2019d skip the fertilizer & just use a nice, rich organic compost. Size Mine is now 3\u2032 x 4\u2032 tall so be sure to give it room to grow. The root system is not for the faint of heart, & you can read about it in \u201cpropagation\u201d below.\nPruning\nMy Felcos aren\u2019t well acquainted with this plant because it rarely needs pruning, maybe once a year. As it\u2019s grown I\u2019ve had to trim a few fronds (stems) off the walkway but that\u2019s about it. The Myers Fern grows so densely that the older growth will sometimes crowd out & smother the younger growth which eventually turns brown. I leave it because it\u2019s so insignificant \u2013 I have so many plants growing year round that I can\u2019t be that picky in the garden!\nPropagation\nYou can propagate this fern from seed which comes from the red berries it produces but division is by far the easiest way to do it. I had planted 1 in a mixed container planting for a client & noticed after a few years that the Impatiens I planted that season weren\u2019t doing well at all. It turns out that the Myers fern\u2019s extensive root system, with all it\u2019s tubers attached, had completely taken over the pot & was actually wrapping around itself. The fern looked fine but the Impatiens with their finer, much less competitive roots were loosing the battle.\nWhat I did will give you an idea as to how tough this plant is. I wanted to save my client\u2019s pot so it was a bit of a struggle to get the fern out. Even after I completely pried it away from the sides, the bottom wasn\u2019t budging at all. I finally got it out & ended up sawing it into thirds. My client now has 3 Myers Ferns growing in her garden which were all doing fine & growing like crazy last time I saw them.

As you go inland, partial shade is best so be sure to keep them out of the strong afternoon sun.\nWatering\nMyers Ferns aren\u2019t considered to be drought tolerant but neither do they require huge amounts of water. They have a tuberous root system which stores water so be sure not to keep them too wet. They prefer to be slightly moist, not dripping wet & the top few inches of soil can actually dry out between waterings. USDA Hardiness Zone They grow best in zones 9-11 & will show damage if the temps go below 20 \u2013 25 degrees F.\nFlowers\nMine blooms in late winter into spring. The flowers, which are tiny & white, are followed by green berries which eventually red towards fall.\nPests\nMine has never gotten any. The Myers Fern is not known to be prone to any pests or diseases which makes me give it another star. Uses In garden beds, rock gardens, containers, hanging baskets (its close relative the Sprengeri or Asparagus Fern is used more for this) & indoors as houseplants. I\u2019ve never grow 1 as a houseplant but I imagine it would appreciate being outdoors in the warmer months.

If you use more than that you may need more food coloring than I used.\nFor the initial dying, I dropped in 10 - 15 drops of food coloring. I think closer to 10 is better as you should get a better speckled look. Drip in a little vinegar at this time if you are going to use it but don't let the rice get too watery.\nOnce you use the rice, the color is going to come off. I found I could add about 5 more drops of food coloring in between eggs and it would work perfectly. (As you can see, I only did a few eggs so I think this is accurate but if you are worried, put your egg in the bag (or cup) see how well it covers and if it isn't very good, take the egg out and put a few more drops in the rice, mix it up, and try putting the egg in again.)\nAlways add dye to the rice when the egg is NOT in it. You don't want to get the dye right on the egg.\nRemember to put the eggs in the fridge when you are done (unless you don't want to, then do what you want).\nI thought I would be covered in dye after doing this but I wasn't. The only time I really got dye on me was when I brushed against the bag or the cup when they had dye on them. I didn't really get any dye on me when I touched the eggs, but plastic gloves are nice if you have them. (Also, if you touch the eggs with wet hands, the dye could come off, try to only touch them with dry hands.)\nBe careful of using the gloves as you can transfer dye onto the eggs from them.

Set up your circuit board securely on the bed of the router using double sided tape (make sure there are no wrinkles) be sure the circet board is level and firm with the point of the drill bit. Using a 1/64 milling bit, mill the circuit paths with the circet file copied from above (the mostly black .png with white lines). Then, after chaning to a 1/32 milling bit drill round the edge with the border file. You need to define the type of cut whether it is milling or cut out under the the defaults option. Remember to note down the routers coordinates so you can use the border png file to then cut out the circuit with a drilling bit. It is important that it is set correctly otherwise some of your circet may be cut by the cutout file.\nStep 2. Clean your board. A lot of issues you will have can be solved\nnow by making sure there are no stray fibers of copper on your board, go ver it with a small piece of steel where needed and gently rub off any sharp parts being VERY carful not to pull the copper off the board when doing so.\nStep 3. Collect all the electronic parts and solder them onto the circuit board, using the circuit diagram (above) as a guide. it is important to take your time during this process, over heating components with the soldering iron may result in the parts failure.\nStep 4. Attach the 6 pin set to the top 6 platforms using solder, be gentle, use tweesers and do not over heat the board as it will lift the copper off the board (this is because of the amout of solder you will be using)\nStep 5. Check your board. Make sure no lines are being bridgeed with solder that are not ment to be, to know what lines are ment to be connected and which ones are not refire to the Eagle file (attached to this step).\nAlso, make sure all you the lines and connections work using a multimeter, you want to make sure you have no dry joins (solder joins which do not actually bridge the gap) you want to check the pins on this too.\nStep 6. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the min board files, This board only has a mosfit and a 5v regulator attached to it, with the for pin holes facing up solder the mosfit on the left and the regulator on the right with wach foot on one of the squares milled into the circet board.\nStep 7. You need to program the a chip by attaching the USB from the AVR programmer to your computer and then attaching the other side to the board. You do this by inserting the 6 male heads of the 'Male to female wires' into the AVR plug and the female ends into the 1x8 pins of the Arduino (use the image above for the plug configuration matching labels) Attach to the USB port on the computer. Step 5. Attach The AV programmer USB to TTL serial cable to the top 6x1 Pins. -Green and black on the right hand side. (to orrientate the board the dot on the ATMEGA should be at the top left)\nStep 8. To program the chip you can use Arduino which is a free downloadable software. After installing this software follow the instructions in setupguide (above) you will need the files in atmega master (above)\nStep 9. Using the Ardunio software load orbit lamp script (above) and in the drop down menus above set the chip to 16 Mega hrts, the correct board type (ATMEGA 382P) and the select BURN BOOT LOADER.\nAfter this is complete with the code still up press upload.\nNB: You only need to do this the first time you upload to your chip. If it comes up with an error, recheck all your connections on the circuit board. Download the code file for Arduino, verify the code and upload it.

This meant less paint was used and hence each addition of the 2 oz of orange probably had less effect of the overall paint ratio as the initial stair transitions, but hard to notice.

A Moby wrap for example, is 5.5m long, but this is just a guide.\n\nThe wrap needs to be approximately between 60-70cm wide so most lengths of fabrics will be able to make at least two wraps.\n\nTo get away with the \"no sew\" option, you want something that will roll up on itself when cut, otherwise you will have to overlock the outer edges.\n\nOnce you have washed and dried you fabric, your ready to go.\n\nFor more about fabric options for DIY solutions see this flow chart - http://wp.me/p6RKSX-1H", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDM/NT6N/IKOCVNIB/FDMNT6NIKOCVNIB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTY/IJ46/IKRNIFRV/FTYIJ46IKRNIFRV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Choosing Your Fabric"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "This grey material is approximately 1.3m wide so I am going to make two wraps out of it.

The dinosaur piece measures 32cm by 35cm. The monster stripes measures 27cm by 45cm. And the white sketch panel measures 30cm by 40cm.

Painting the mouldings may have added some thickness that could make them a little more difficult to replace. You can scrape excess paint off the back and sides of the moulding with a utility knife.\nTo replace the mouldings, place a shorter piece in first, then a long piece at a 90 degree angle. Then, butt up the corners of the other short and long piece and work them in from the corner where they meet. (Tip: the long piece is a little flexible, if you need to pull it inward slightly as you push the corner down, it will help you fit it. Just don't bend it too much or you may break it!). You can also use a small piece of wood to help work it in. If you need to do this set the wood over the corner where the mouldings meet, lightly tap down with mallet. You have to ensure that the corners have started to move down into place before tapping down with mallet or the mouldings will be damaged. This technique can also be used to tap down the mouldings that haven't gone all the way in.\nOnce you have all mouldings back in place, use a hammer or a nail gun to nail the mouldings in position, applying two nails to each or nailing close to the old nail holes. Use a nail set to set the nails and apply a little putty over the head. Once the putty is dry. Touch up any areas with paint including the nail heads and let dry.\nNow your door is ready to hang! Also, don't forget your door handle! We picked up a vintage cast iron door handle and back plate from a local salvage shop. The salvage shops are also a great place to buy a vintage door if you don't already have one!\nWe won't go into detail about how to hang a door in this Instructable.

Tape the ends of the rope to prevent it from unraveling or tape several feet up from the end and untwist the 2 or all three of the strands.

While I have the rope in my vice I place the free end into my cordless drill, set your drill rotate in the opposite direction of the rope's strand twist. Run the drill till the rope coils on itself. Release the rope from the drill chuck, be careful when you release it from the drill chuck as their is quite a bit of stored energy in the rope.

Fearing the process, I used to do the most basic of free online filings and get back pretty minimal returns. As my career as a creative professional grew, not only did I start to deal with a lot more confusing forms (multiple W2s, 1099s from freelance work), I also realized I was missing out on a lot of career specific write offs that I didn't know how to incorporate into cookie cutter online forms. Changing the way I approached my taxes has resulted in significantly larger returns and a feeling of confidence and command in my finances. Hooray for grown up stuff! And what could be more grown up than camping out on the couch in your pajama pants with some hot cocoa on a rainy day and getting those taxes taken care of!\nThis Ible will explore tax prep tips for geared toward creative professionals operating the in U.S. Most of these tips will be based on examples involving visual arts, since that is where I'm coming from, but many apply to those working in music, writing, and other forms of entertainment too. While I can't guarantee any specific jump in your tax return, I do think you'll find that being prepared will yield better results, plus you'll feel more confident having an active hand in your tax destiny.", "title": "Tax Prep for Creative Professionals", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Tax-Prep-for-Creative-Professionals/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "While this title can mean many different things, I feel a safe generalization is that you might want to look into handling your taxes as a \"creative professional\" if 50% or more of your income can be attributed to creative business(es).\nFor example, you might work in a graphic design firm, a photography studio, a post production house, as an in-house writer for a social media outlet or website, or in a specific division of product design (like painting faces on dolls at a toy company). Even if you are a full time employee and can say you have a 'regular\" job, creative fields like these often extend beyond office hours and into your home life. We'll talk more about this in the write offs section.\nIf you are primarily a freelancer for creative industries, working project to project, I HIGHLY encourage you to approach your taxes in the manner explained in this Ible. Your livelihood and life are often very intertwined and this will mean you're probably able to write off things you didn't realize you could. Examples might be a career as a wedding photographer, if you own your own bakery, furniture shop, or jewelry studio, or voice actors who read for commercials and audio books.\nIf you earn a significant income from your Etsy (or other web based\nshop), whether or not you have a \"regular\" job as well, you might want to consider this. The fees you pay for ads on websites, your business cards, booth fees for events and conferences, and other deductions are within your reach as an independent craftsperson.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFF/J2IH/IKFPYRR5/FFFJ2IHIKFPYRR5.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Who Is a Creative Professional?"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I can not recommend this enough. Online or general tax services (like\nTurbo Tax or H&R Block) are all well and good for most people, but after dealing with an industry specific tax guy I would never go back! Someone acquainted with the terminology and rhythms of creative business will be easier to communicate with and will have insights about business related write-offs that you may not have thought of before.\nThis is especially handy if you do a lot of freelance or independent contractor work.\nA tax person accustomed to creative/ entertainment clients will know exactly what to do with a pile of 1099s. A general tax consultant may know what to do technically speaking, but may not understand that this is your \"normal\". I recall one such person looking at my 1099s and then asking me if I was planning to get a \"real job\" for next year. Wrong response!\nHow to Find One\nSimple --ask around! Ask your creative colleagues if they have anyone they would recommend. Have a union? See if anyone there has a tax wizard. Chances are at least one of your peers or co-workers has a tax person they trust and endorse. Referrals also give you an edge as many tax firms are more likely to make time within a busy schedule to see a friend of a current client than they are a total cold call.\nConsulting colleagues means you can also gather information and compare options from an insider's perspective.\nHow much does an appointment typically cost with this person? Does their calender fill up fast? Are they easy to work with? Do they offer appointments by mail or phone if your schedule is packed? After hearing about several animation specific tax people from co-workers, I went with one guy whose rate was fair and whose correspondence made me feel most at ease.\nOk...so what if you're an Etsy seller in the middle of Wyoming and you don't have workplace colleagues to ask?\nConnect with other creatives through web forums to build that colleague\nbase! Post where you spend most of your time and suspect other creative individuals will be hanging out too. Seek out folks in your area. Whether or not they have the answer to your tax query, you'll be glad you made some personal connections.\nCost\nTrue, an industry specific tax person may seem daunting at first because they will likely charge more than what you're used to. If stuff like Turbo tax is somewhere between free and $50, expect private, industry specific tax folks to be at least $100. Nothing to sneeze at, but consider what you gain:\n--Most of these tax guys establish friendly relationships with their clients and are happy to answer your questions prior to tax time via phone or email. Not sure whether something is a write off? Ask. Trying to make sense of a form you got from your bank? Ask. The last thing they want is for you to show up to your actual appointment unprepared, so giving tidbits of support in advance helps you help them help you. You may not be able to count on that support from a general tax service, especially one who does not know your history. Feeling confused while trying to click through an online tax form is THE WORST!\n--Larger return. Again, I can't guarantee what type of boost you'll see, but I'm almost certain you'll notice a positive difference. Understanding how to document and submit appropriate write offs can really add up. It can potentially bring your tax return up hundreds of dollars. That suddenly makes your difference in appointment cost well worth it. If you started too late to nail it this year, you know what to do for next time!\n--Trustworthy connection for future financial endeavors. Finding a great tax person can pay off at more than just tax time. Many of these professionals are also financial advisors and can provide insights or recommendations on other subjects such as investing or home buying. They'll also have your financial information on record and easy to access, so in the event you have to bring copies of your last two tax returns in for a loan pre-approval, you'll know exactly where you can get these with zero digging. Again, we creative people are not always the best number crunchers and having someone trustworthy to break down this stuff for us can take a lot of the stress out of big acquisitions. General tax institutions and banks can also offer suggestions, but may be more interested in selling the products they partner with than finding what is best for you personally.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: Find an Industry Specific Tax Professional"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Essentially, any expenditure you have made to legitimately support or further your creative business/ career is a potential write off. My tax professional provided me with this spreadsheet and said to tally my receipts and documents for as many categories as possible. Math-phobic folks often just take the standard tax deduction because this process of itemizing write offs sounds like a lot of work, but it really doesn't have to be and it can pay off (literally) when it comes to your return.\nNote that everyone is allowed to write off thing like medical expenses, your annual vehicle registration fee, and donations to charitable organizations. This is not specific to creative professionals, but I felt it was worth mentioning here for anyone approaching their own taxes for the first time. At first I felt like this was somehow cheating the system but my tax professional assured me this was all legitimate and well within reason. As long as you save your physical documentation of the totals you submit, should you ever have to prove something in an audit, you're good to go. Such documents might include receipts, online billing statements, or sections of invoices to clients.\nBusiness Write Off Examples. These examples pertain to visual arts and entertainment, but reading them may help those of you in other creative industries better understand what types of documents you might want to start saving, or what you might ask your own tax professional about.\nBusiness Meals -- Any meal over which business was discussed is technically a \"business meal\".\nDid you meet a potential client for coffee? Maybe you grabbed lunch with a former co-worker and discussed job opportunities where he is now. Perhaps you attended a union mixer at a local restaurant/ bar and got something to nibble on while networking. All of these receipts can be saved and written off. Just know where to draw the line and be honest with yourself. Going out and drinking beer until 2 a.m. with people who just happen to be co-workers is not a \"business meal\". Just picture yourself in front of an auditor. If you would have trouble holding up this receipt for 12 beers and keeping a straight face, just don't try it. That one is on you.\nTravel--Hotel and airfare to events where you network and keep abreast of the latest industry trends are legitimate write offs. For me, this includes things like Comic Con and Wonder Con. Consider the festivals, conferences, and trade fairs you attend throughout the year (Maker Faire, CHA, etc). If you have to pay for parking while you attend said events, that can also be logged as an expense. As long as you're spending significant amounts of time making new connections and talking trade (not just lounging by the pool), save those receipts!\nHome Office --If you're an independent contractor, freelancer, or take a lot of work home with you on nights and weekends, you likely qualify for two different types of home office related write offs\nEquipment, Tools, and Supplies-- If I buy a new computerupon which I will be doing design freelance, that's a write off. New webcam for filming reference videos? Write off. So, if you're a voice actor and you want to make your own in-home record booth to use for your professional gigs/ demos, you can write off things like your computer, microphone, recording software, and the sound buffering foam you line the room with. These items are all contributing to your ability to do quality work from your home office setting. Again, try to stay honest with yourself about what you write off. Unless there's a true professional reason that you need a 42 inch flat screen in your recording booth, don't try to slide that on the tab too.\nHome Office Space-- If you work from home consistently, your tax professional may even suggest writing off a portion of your home utilities and rent under business use. My tax guy asks me for my total utility and rent costs during the months I worked from home, then uses the square footage of my actual home office area vs. total home square footage to determine a percentage that can be written off. If your \"office\" is more of a garage/ workshop setting, ask your tax professional whether this formula can apply and whether you would have to provide any different or additional documentation.\nPromotional Materials --Expenditures related to promoting yourself/ your business are definitely good write offs. The money you pay to print business cards, buy a banner to hang above your craft fair booth, or run promoted ads on sites like Etsy all qualify. Print your e-receipts soon after purchase so you don't forget about these costs at tax time.\nPhone or Internet Expense -- If your work involves a lot of calling or web research from home, you may be able to write off a percentage of those bills as business related. My tax guy has a standard percentage he applies each year, based on an average. Some tax professionals may try to nail down a more specific amount if your work is very phone or research oriented.\nProfessional Expenses --This is a broad category that can include any other creative industry expenses you might have. If you are in a union, you can tally up your quarterly dues for the year. Subscriptions to trade magazines keeping you up to date on industry news is another one. In the film/ entertainment industry, there's a category called \"research and reference\" that can include movie or museum tickets, and even your Netflix subscription fee. While these last ones are undoubtedly part leisure, they do help you stay in the know about what's being made and who is making it. Think about what you as a composer, prop maker, seamstress, logo designer, baker, camera operator, or blogger might be paying for that could be considered a professional expense.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLO/10A3/IKFPYWCH/FLO10A3IKFPYWCH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ0/H8SE/IKFPYWDO/FZ0H8SEIKFPYWDO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Write Offs"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Among the reasons I've heard people give for why it's \"too hard\" to keep track of receipts for itemization is the assumption that it's going to be a big mess to sort through at tax time. Well, if you're just throwing everything into a shoebox, then yeah. If you establish a simple, clean filing system from the beginning (and remember to use it), it all falls right into place when you go to do your write off tallies.\nDesignated Filing Location -- I highly recommend getting a folio with multiple tabs. This way you can divide the folio into simple categories for your main document types (Example: W2s, 1099s, Interest Income, Write Offs, etc).\nKeep this folio in a spot that is easy to access (i.e. NOT the top shelf of the closet behind the wrapping paper) so that you can make a habit of filing your documents/ receipts on a regular basis. Remove receipts from your wallet or purse weekly and take 5 minutes to put them in their proper envelopes. It really beats sorting through a giant heap of little papers at the last minute.\nSubcategories-- To create subcategories within one of these folders --let's say \"write offs\"-- I like to use labeled envelopes. So, within the \"Write Offs\" section of my folio, I might have different envelopes for Business Meals, Travel, Medical, Pro Expenses, Auto, etc. These envelopes can be recycled from your mail since they don't need to be pretty --their only purpose is to contain and divide. If one of your envelopes becomes full before the end of the year, simply start a second and label it \"Business Meals 2\", or whatever the case may be.\nStreamlining with Statements -- Still daunted by the notion of having to keep track of so many little receipts? You might consider streamlining your documentation process by always using a particular credit card for a designated category of write offs. For example, I have one credit card that I use exclusively for all my \"Business Meals\", since that is one of my biggest categories. By always using the same card, I can simply total up my 12 monthly credit card statements rather than having to save dozens upon dozens of receipts and punch them in individually.\nBy keeping your documents and receipts categorized and organized all year, calculating totals for your tax professional is simply a matter of sitting with a calculator for 30 min or so and recording your results. The \"work\" of sorting has already been done for you, so you can even take care of this while you watch something on t.v. You'll be surprised how much you actually spent over the year, and how keeping record of that can help you get some back.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FN8/W7L7/IKFPYRNX/FN8W7L7IKFPYRNX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT6/IBRL/IKFPYRLS/FT6IBRLIKFPYRLS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWD/95LK/IKFPYWEG/FWD95LKIKFPYWEG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX3/Z5MN/IKFPYWGI/FX3Z5MNIKFPYWGI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBI/P0UU/IKFPYWIU/FBIP0UUIKFPYWIU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Starting Organized and Staying Organized"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Laws vary by location, but chances are if you operate a freelance or independent creative business you have to have a registered Business Tax License with your city/ state.

In case you're wondering what the average depth of a plaster and lathe wall is, the correct answer is \"AAAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\"\n2. I'm not going to go out and buy extra long drill bits for this project.\nSo here is the solution I came up with. I measured the depth of the shortest drill bit that I would use, then DOUBLED that distance, then SUBTRACTED a tiny bit. Thats how I decided how long I should cut my sucker rod. In my case, I figured out that I could drill a hole that was 3 5/8 inches deep. So I cut my sucker rod to 7 inch lengths. make sense? 3 1/2 PLUS 3 1/2.\nWell, I say I CUT my sucker rod.

Boil to re-use.\n\nA nice rainy-day project that has a bit of science behind it but will also be popular with kids in the winter is making re-usable hand-warmers.\nThere are a group of girls from my daughter's class who come over a few times a year to do a day's science or technology project with me. We try to illustrate some scientific or technical feature and use that as the basis of making something to take home and use/play with. We aim to use tools and methods that might not normally be encountered by little girls (they were 7-8 years old) and always make sure there is something to decorate!\n\nOne autumn we made re-usable hand warmers. They are not hard to make and illustrate many scientific concepts. At a basic level, there is the idea of states of matter; solids, liquids and gasses, and phase changes due to heating/cooling. At a deeper level, there is crystals and crystallisation, seeding crystalisation and super-saturation and at a relatively high level there is latent heat of fusion (enthalpy of fusion) and conservation of energy. You could pitch this project anywhere from age around 6 up to maybe 13-14 depending upon how deeply you analyse what's happening.

I\u2019m so happy that I\u2019m able to grow a variety of these pineapple relatives in my garden here in Santa Barbara. Bromeliads are tough, interesting and don\u2019t need any fussing over which is my kind of plant to have in a climate where gardening is a year round activity. They\u2019re a very popular houseplant so I want to share with what I\u2019ve learned over the years about caring for them indoors. By the way, this post is about growing them indoors for the long haul, not just as a short term blooming/color plant.\nI started out my post college horticultural career as an interior plant technician, which is a fancy name for someone who runs all over the place and takes care of plants in offices, lobbies, malls, hotels and even airports. Granted these aren\u2019t the most welcoming environments for plants which are native to the sub tropics and tropics, but in all cases, the Bromeliads certainly held their own. Tough I tell you! They were sold as \u201ccolor plants\u201d and certainly were a lot more long lasting and much more forgiving than begonias, azaleas, mums and the like.", "title": "Caring for Bromeliads: What You Need to Know to Grow Them Indoors", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Caring-for-Bromeliads-What-You-Need-to-Know-to-Gro/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I\u2019ve not only cared for and placed 100\u2019s of Bromeliads on commercial accounts but I\u2019ve also grown them as houseplants too. I\u2019m happy to share what I\u2019ve learned with you:\nLight : Like many other tropical plants brought indoors, Bromeliads like nice, bright light but no prolonged periods of direct, hot sun. In nature they grow under the canopies of other plants where it\u2019s bright but direct sun is limited. They\u2019ll survive for a while in lower light conditions but need a fair amount of it to bring out the color and initiate flowering and pupping (their process of making babies \u2013 see Propagation below).\nIt\u2019s a bit vague without getting into foot candle measurements but you want your Bromeliad to be somewhere near but not in a window or windows with a west or south exposure. During the darker months you may have to move it to a spot that gets more light. In commercial accounts they were rotated out on a monthly basis so the exposure wasn\u2019t as big a deal.\nWatering: I\u2019ve found that Bromeliads like a good watering every month. Water the soil thoroughly & then let it all drain out of the pot. The majority of Bromeliads are epiphytes (meaning they grow on other plants, rocks, logs, etc & not in the soil) so never keep them soggy or let them sit directly in water. Keep the cup, which is center part aka the tank or reservoir, 1/2 full of water. Be sure to flush out the cup every month or 2 as bacteria can collect in the dirty water.\nIn the cooler, darker months back off on the watering, to maybe every 2 months, & keep the cup 1/4 full. You don\u2019t want your Bromeliad to rot. Bromeliads with a cup (like Aechmeas & Neorgelias) are susceptible to salt damage which occurs because of the water quality or over fertilizing. Although most tap water is just fine, yours could possibly have high amounts of salts & mineral, so in that case use rain or distilled water.\nSoil / Repotting:Bromeliads love rich, organic matter in their soil but they must have excellent drainage. If you have Cymbidium orchid mix, then you can use this for potting up your Bromeliads too. I use a mixture of succulent & cactus mix, orchid bark, worm castings, & compost. Another good additive is coco coir, which is a more environmentally friendly alternative to peat moss.\nBromeliads have a small root system so you don\u2019t have to worry about repotting them too often. Every 4-5 years is probably just fine & you only need to go up 1 or 2 pot sizes. And, it\u2019s best to not repot them in the cooler months when the roots are resting.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSQ/O7S0/IKECN6LB/FSQO7S0IKECN6LB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1:"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: You Can Get All the Info in the Video Also!"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Fertilizing: Bromeliads aren\u2019t fussy & don\u2019t need much if any fertilizing. If you feel the need to feed them, then use a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted at 1/2 strength in the spring or summer. There are fertilizers which are specially formulated for Bromeliads but whichever you decide to use, don\u2019t over fertilize them!\nTemperature / Humidity : Temperature isn\u2019t too important as Bromeliads tolerate a wide range of temps. Mine grow outdoors & our winter months can get into the 40\u2019s & into the 80\u2019s/90\u2019s in the summer/fall.\nHumidity is more important as these plants are native to the subtropics & the tropics. If your home is really dry, then mist them a couple of times a week or grow them over a tray filled with water & pebbles to up the ante on the humidity.\nPropagation: The easiest way to propagate Bromeliads is by removing the pups (the little babies that appear off the base of the mother plant) & replanting them. If you\u2019re new to this, you might want to wait until the pups are a fairly good size so roots have formed. I\u2019ve also removed pups when they\u2019re smaller & planted them with success. Growers also propagate them by seed but it\u2019s a much, much more tedious process.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8D/MUOS/IKECN6OI/F8DMUOSIKECN6OI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3:"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Pruning: These plants require very little pruning which makes me very happy. A bottom leaf will occasionally die \u2013 simply remove it. If your Bromeliad has a flower stalk, like an Aechmea or Guzmania, then prune off it off after it has died. At some point the mother plant will die (but don\u2019t be sad \u2013 remember, I said new babies will appear) & you\u2019ll need to cut that off after it completely goes.\nFlowers : Yes, Bromeliads have them in a variety of colors. Some have a stalk with a large showy flower atop it while others have small flowers which appear deep inside the cup.\nPests: Mine have never gotten any pests whether they were growing indoors or out. They\u2019re most susceptible to mealy bugs & scale. You can wipe the mealy bug off with alcohol & a cotton swab. Scale can be removed with your fingernail or a dull knife. Don\u2019t use an oil spray (like horticultural or neem oils) on your Bromeliads as they can smother the plant.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJU/6B9C/IKECN6MG/FJU6B9CIKECN6MG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4:"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Here\u2019s a head\u2019s up if you have kitties: they love to chew on those crunchy leaves but the good news is that these plants are considered non-toxic.

For the early training of my standard schnauzer Isabel I used a hand-held hula hoop, but the day came when I needed a more realistic apparatus. To make a regulation-sized hoop for the tire jump, I needed 98 inches of drain pipe. I had enough left over after using a 100-foot roll to outfit the downspouts on two houses. In the process, I learned that this stuff is thin-walled and somewhat fragile. It would be very difficult to cut it perfectly all the way around. Hence, I cut it roughly four inches too long, then used scissors to carefully cut it down to the ideal size.\nOdds are the pipe will have some curvature to it, but the hoop needed is much more tightly curved. I increased the curvature of the pipe and made it the right shape by forcibly bending it around my knees repeatedly along its length. Finally, I bought an adapter to join the two ends together.

I think this one was used to ship a heat pump that was installed at my workplace. I scavenged it before it was thrown in the dumpster. It had to be an extra long pallet in order to provide adequate jump height.\nI removed all the 1 x 8\" boards from the pallet except the outer two. I used a hammer and pry bar. If you are slow and careful, you might leave the remaining boards in a nice smooth condition. I wasn't slow and careful, and only one of the boards I removed survived (to be seen later). A handy removal technique is described here.\nA pair of two-by-fours remained in the middle of my frame-to-be, and I had to remove them from the more fragile one-by-eights. After some cogitation, I cut them across the center with a reciprocating saw. I laid the pallet down on the driveway, put my feet on the one-by-eight and grabbed the two-by-four by its freshly cut end, pulling up so that it served as its own lever. This method worked masterfully the first time, as the nails were pulled out of it without difficulty. On the second attempt, the one-by-eight cracked a bit. The crack wasn't severe, so I continued. I switched to knocking the two-by-four from side to side with a crow bar to make some space between the boards, then using the same crow bar to pry the two-by-four off.

As it was already the proper length, I simply fit the board to the top of the frame, predrilled holes and drove a pair of 2\" deck screws into each end.\nTo make the feet of the frame I had planned to use a two-by-four from this pallet (removed in the last step), but they were pretty ranked out, so I grabbed one I had left from a different pallet. The board was 44 inches long. I marked it in the center, then marked it 4\" away from center on opposite sides and marked a diagonal line between these last two points. I made a line with the same slope at each end of the board to create the pattern for the two feet. I marked the feet in the center and the two-by-fours at the bottom of the frame at their centers, matched them up, predrilled holes, and drove in three 3 1/2\" deck screws to attach the feet to the frame.

This computes into 66 bottles which is approximately the number of bottles that we used. Of course this number may vary, but you can get an estimation of how many bottles you may use.\nThe soil however occupies a circular area, that means that the bigger the diameter the soil you should add increases quadratically!

Fix one end to the center and then draw and mark the circle with the other extreme of the string.\nUse the shovel to get rid of the grass inside the circle, dig a little , something like 10cm beneath the rest of the terrain. This will help water to be collected at the base.\nPut the rocks in the perimeter of the circle. This will create a barrier that prevents grass to grow back into the circle\nBuild your circles!\nMeasure 22cm from the outer circle and start placing the bottles into the inner circle, a quick way to do this was laying down the bottle (whose length is 22cm), and then pushing the neck until the body was half underneath the ground. Repeat until a circle is completed. Stomp with your foot next to the bottles, make sure the ground is compact. Fill the inner of the new circle with soil until it reaches the top of the bottles, then stomp the newly added soil, apply some water to compact the terrain. With the steel wire tie the circle of bottles from its outermost side, the pliers will be useful to tighten up the wire and to cut it.\nRepeat the process with a new inner circle of bottles, place them, stomp a little, fill with soil and tighten up.\nReach the desired height, in this case we used 3 circles.\nNow in order to make the spiral you should remove one third of the circular section and rearrange it to touch the outer circle, see the diagram. Add soil to keep the bottles in place. If you are concerned in how steep the slopes should be, just look at the inclination of the mountains in your area, your spiral now resemble a little mountain, the erosion in your place shouldn't make the soil slip, the whole construction should be sturdy, if not it will crumble, but don't worry too much, roots of the herbs will help to hold the soil in place", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F20/5C9R/IKBFMR04/F205C9RIKBFMR04.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF3/4KAR/IKBFMR02/FF34KARIKBFMR02.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU2/W1LB/IKBFMTZ1/FU2W1LBIKBFMTZ1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP8/TEYN/IKBFMQZV/FP8TEYNIKBFMQZV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Build the Concentric Circles"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Once your spiral is done you may water it, this will help the soil to compact, will test if your construction can endure the additional weight of the water, and will make it easier to plant the herbs later.\nLet it dry for 10 minutes or so, take a break, from this point rain shouldn't destroy your construction and you should feel happy..! Think of the actual plants that you wish to put in and how do you want to arrange it, most of the spirals there have herbs, they are small and won't grow a big root system, but there are other plants that could be planted as well like broccoli, onions, small tomatoes, strawbeerries, yerbabuena, oregano, cabbage, etc. Take the plants you want and transplant them into the spiral, this is better done at sunrise or sunset, the reason is that sunlight might be too stressful for the root, avoid to expose the roots to the light.

The only problem is that our new bedroom has no closets. We had some time on our hands and a shop where we could work in temporarily, so we decided to build furniture that would help us out. What we came up with for our bedroom is \u201cThe Dresser Bed.\u201d\nThe theory is pretty simple. Two low, long dressers under the bed, with bookshelves at the end for further storage. Also, we planned an area under the bed between the dressers that we could make long-term storage.\nI had never built dressers from scratch before, and I have to say it was more difficult than I had anticipated. It takes a lot of wood and a lot of work, but the result is attractive, functional furniture that we will use for years.\nMaterials for Project\n\u00b7 3 sheets \u00be\u201c plywood (all sheets were 4\u2019 by 8\u2019)\n\u00b7 1 sheet \u00bd\u201c plywood\n\u00b7 2.5 sheets \u00bc\u201c plywood\n\u00b7 1 2x4\n\u00b7 Titebond III wood glue\n\u00b7 Kreg Jig with associated screws/clamps\n\u00b7 Sandpaper\n\u00b7 Wood putty\n\u00b7 Paint/Primer\n\u00b7 Plastic drawer runner replacement kit (6 kits of 2 each)\nTools used\n\u00b7 Table saw\n\u00b7 Jig Saw\n\u00b7 Miter Saw\n\u00b7 Router\n\u00b7 Framing square", "title": "Dresser Platform Bed From Scratch", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Dresser-Platform-Bed-From-Scratch/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Based on your desired bed size, you need to first calculate the dimensions of your dressers. We received a hand-me-down full sized mattress, so we decided to make a flexible design that would work with either a full or queen sized mattress. We settled on a 65\u201dx20\u201d dresser top, which we would set 18\u201d apart. Then bookshelves on the end would make it long enough for a mattress. Before cutting any wood, I used a free google sketch up program to design a front and back panel to use for reference dimensions. On the back panel of the frame I had two 3\u201d vertical boards for securing the runners, and I recessed the frame \u00bc\u201d into the dresser so that \u00bc\u201d backing would sit flush. Another important forethought on the back panel was 1-1/4\u201d deep, \u00be\u201d wide grooves along the top edge. These grooves allow cross pieces to span the 18\u201d gap between the dressers to hold slats which will support the mattress. I made three equally spaced grooves, but if I were doing it again, I would make four grooves and have the outside ones at each end of the dresser, for added mattress support.\nI measured all of the pieces off the google sketch up model, planned the most efficient use of our \u00be\u201d plywood sheets, and cut out our pieces. While we were using the table saw and cutting \u00be\u201d pieces, we also cut out our two dresser tops and set them aside. After cutting out all of the frame/side pieces and laying them out, we marked where we would use the kreg jig at each joint including holes for attaching the dresser top. We used the kreg jig to drill pocket holes where we marked and glued/screwed the front frame and back frame. Getting the front panel to be square and in plane is very important. One thing that helped us was making a piece of \u00be\u201d plywood that was the exact height our drawer spaces would be, so when we were screwing them together we used the spacer to make them all the correct height.\nAfter giving the front/back frames time to dry, we assembled the basic rectangular shape of the dressers by drilling counter-sunk pilot holes and screwing them together with the addition of wood glue.\nFor reference, the pieces between the drawers vertically are 1\u201d wide, and piece between the two columns is 1-3/4\u201d. We left a 2-1/2\u201d border on the top and 3\u201d on the bottom.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FP8/MU05/IK7BZ6EL/FP8MU05IK7BZ6EL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXP/R5F3/IK7BZ6EM/FXPR5F3IK7BZ6EM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUG/U5E6/IK7BZ6ER/FUGU5E6IK7BZ6ER.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKF/ALXP/IK7BZ6EZ/FKFALXPIK7BZ6EZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM8/ZRIE/IK7BZ6F0/FM8ZRIEIK7BZ6F0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4G/BBTE/IK7BZ6F1/F4GBBTEIK7BZ6F1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZA/8C29/IK7BZ6FG/FZA8C29IK7BZ6FG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZF/4RHZ/IK7BZ6F4/FZF4RHZIK7BZ6F4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXU/BKAV/IK7BZ6F5/FXUBKAVIK7BZ6F5.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Dresser Frame"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Drawers were a little daunting at first, but after figuring out the design and style we wanted, I had a lot of fun making them. The face and sides of our drawer are cut out of \u00be\u201d plywood. The backs are \u00bd\u201d and the bottoms are \u00bc\u201d. After determining the dimensions of all of our pieces, we cut them all to size using the table saw.\nFaces: 28-3/8\u201d by 7-3/8\u201d\nSides: 6-5/8\u201d by 15-3/4\u201d\nBack: 6-5/8\u201d by 27-3/8\u201d\nWe designed it so that there would be 1/8\u201d gap on each side of the drawer when it goes into the drawer space. The face overhangs the drawer opening by \u00bc\u201d on the top and the bottom and 3/8\u201d on the sides.\nWe used a dado blade on the table saw set to 1/4 \u201c width to cut a \u00bc \u201c deep groove 11/16\u201d above the bottom edge of our drawer sides and back. On the face piece, we cut the groove 1\u201d from the bottom, so that the face would be centered over the frame opening when the drawers are closed. If you don\u2019t have a dado blade, you can do the same thing with multiple cuts on the table saw blade. To accommodate the drawer slides that we will talk more about in the next step, we cut a 2 \u201c gap centered on our back pieces that extended up to the cut groove. Next we used the router to round all the edges of our drawer faces.\nTo assemble the drawers, we cut a spacer to the exact dimension of the inside of our drawers and cut 2 small \u00bd\u201d spacers, which is how much the face of our drawers overhang the drawer sides. We used a nail gun with 1.5\u201d brad nails and wood glue at all the surfaces to hold the drawers together. To assemble each drawer, we laid the face of a drawer down on the table, put the sides into position, slid the bottom piece into the grooves, and put the long spacer between the sides and the short spacers on the outside of the sides. Then we used a long clamp to hold the whole assembly onto the face of the drawer. This centered our side pieces in relation to the face and the groove for the bottom aligned the pieces vertically. Since the clamp held the pieces together, we laid the drawer backwards and used a nail gun to nail through the face of the drawer into the side pieces. Then we laid the drawer back on the face, removed the clamp and used glue and nails to attach the back piece in place. After constructing all of our drawers, we gave the glue time to set.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FK7/JFP8/IK7BZ6HI/FK7JFP8IK7BZ6HI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL5/ULB1/IK7BZ6HM/FL5ULB1IK7BZ6HM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUS/IIHT/IK7BZ6JY/FUSIIHTIK7BZ6JY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3U/21O7/IK7BZ6IN/F3U21O7IK7BZ6IN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU4/8362/IK7BZ6K8/FU48362IK7BZ6K8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYT/DFF9/IK7BZ6KJ/FYTDFF9IK7BZ6KJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW0/GRA3/IK7BZ6LS/FW0GRA3IK7BZ6LS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTR/7ARL/IK7BZ6LT/FTR7ARLIK7BZ6LT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Drawers"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "We bought plastic drawer runner replacement kits for 12 drawers from Lowes.

Using the dado blade, we put \u00bc\u201d grooves into each piece to create a t-shaped runner. After cutting each wood runner, we slid the plastic drawer runner piece over it to make sure it was a smooth fit. We screwed our plastic pieces onto the backs of all of our drawers and then installed our wood runners into our dresser frame. To install the runners, we re-trimmed each piece to fit exactly in the desired position. After marking the center of the drawer space, we put glue on the front and back end, centered the piece and used a nail gun to attach the front end. Then I moved to the back to hold up the runner, while my wife put in the drawer and leveled it. We adjusted the back of the runner so that the front of the drawer was flush against the frame. When we thought the drawer looked level and flush, I nailed in the back piece. As we went, we left each drawer in place to make sure the faces were parallel.

Then we clamped the top down and screwed it into place using the existing pocket holes we made using the kreg jig earlier.\nWe didn\u2019t buy any trim for this project, so we made our own with some old wood laying around.

As you can see in the photo, all I had to do in each drawer was line up the side pieces with the sides of the drawer and clamp it in place, then I could drill the holes in the same place on every drawer.

Since our total bed platform width was 58\u201d, we decided to make two 29\u201d wide bookshelves. That way, we can slide one out of the way to get into the long-term storage, and they are easier to transport. We decided we wanted them to be 15\u201d deep, which would make the whole assembly long enough for a queen size mattress. We didn\u2019t mind that the full size mattress we have would leave a ledge on the top of the bookshelves.\nBoard sizes \u2013 We cut out two sets of the following, from \u00be\u201d plywood:\nTop = 28.75\u201dx15\u201d (1)\nSides=28\u201dx15\u201d (2)\nShelves = 27.75\u201d x 15\u201d (2)\nAnd a 28.75x28.75 piece of \u00bc plywood for backing.\nWe chose our shelf height based on some big tin cans that we were going to use for storage on the bottom shelf, but you could make the shelf at any level. We found the dado blade to be very useful, because we just cut \u00be\u201d wide grooves \u00bc\u201d deep at the bottom and at the shelf height. That made the assembly very easy.\nWe assembled the shelf dry (without glue) face down on the workbench, then glued and screwed the top onto the sides (remembering the countersunk pilot hole to avoid splitting).

For the purposes of this Instructable, it's sufficient to say that I needed a semi-permanent way to make our kitchen walls look better, as the existing knotty pine is a good fit for a Tahoe cabin but not a mid-century modern. I decided to use joint compound (aka \"mud\") that is normally used for covering the gaps between sheets of sheetrock to fill the gaps between the knotty pine boards, and then paint the walls.\n\"But I've used Spackle before to cover holes. Can't I just use that?\"\nNo. The existing Sheetrocked wall in the kitchen is new; it was put up when we converted our laundry room and the old eat-in area of the kitchen into a third bedroom. There was a gap about 1/2\" wide and an inch deep between the new sheetrock and the old knotty pine in the corner. I didn't want to mud it as the mud would have taken ages to dry and I would have had to do endless coats so I Spackled just that area. Spackle is designed for easy filling of small nail holes, not large expanses that need to look really smooth. I couldn't get the Spackle to properly adhere to the Sheetrock, or get it completely flat, and you can't put a skim coat (top coat) on it to even things out - I guess it's like caulk, which doesn't stick to itself once one layer is dry (yup - learned that one the hard way on a previous project).\nUse Spackle to fill small holes in Sheetrock. Use mud to fill gaps between knotty pine boards.", "title": "How to Make Knotty Pine Look Like Sheetrock", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-Knotty-Pine-Look-Like-Sheetrock/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Tools needed\n1.

Sanding wood is moderately dusty; sanding drywall is awful. And use a face mask; you don't want to breathe this junk. Remove trim - we had some baseboard that had been installed as a 'backsplash,' and I also removed the outlet covers.\nSand the whole surface. Don't even try doing this by hand; I used my trusty Makita belt sander. Sanding overhead (on a vertical surface) isn't nearly as hard as you might think, as the action of the belt helps the sander 'climb' the wall. Controlling it at the bottom of the wall (when it wants to disappear into the countertop) is much more difficult. I used a pretty rough grit; about 50, I think - but use whatever rough grit paper you have.\nWipe down the walls to get all the sanding dust off. Don't skip this; dust mixed with mud = uneven surface.\n(No photos of this step because I didn't want to get the camera covered in dust, and my husband was keeping our toddler busy well away from the nastiness.)", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: Step 1: Prepare Surfaces"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "1. Get your joint compound. I had some of a massive bucket of pre-mixed mud left over from the laundry room project, so that's what I used. It is possible to get powdered compound that you mix with water yourself (not recommended for beginners; too hard to get the consistency right) and also quick-set compound (also not recommended for beginners, as it can start to set up before you've finished getting it on the walls). The regular stuff stakes 24 hours to fully dry, especially in the deep channels between the boards of our project.\n2. If you haven't drywalled before, watch this video to see how to use the tools involved. We will not use tape; drywall has dents at the edges to accommodate the thickness of the tape and mud that are used to bridge the gaps between drywall sheets. Knotty pine doesn't have this, and I didn't want to create 'mounds' of tape and mud to cover the tape edges. The most helpful parts of the video are:\n2:14; loading up the tray with mud;\n3:10; applying the mud to the wall (notice how flat the putty knife is against the wall);\n5:15; ignoring the tape, and starting at the top of the wall because you don't have to worry about bubbles in the tape, see how to hold the knife firmly at a 45 degree angle to take off the excess mud both on the channel itself and around the edges, creating a smooth transition between mud and wall.\n3. Follow these basic steps from the video to apply and smooth your mud. Your boards will likely not be flat (as mine were not), so use mud to 'build up' the surface of the lower board. Use the narrow putty knife to get the mud on the wall (much easier to manage) and use the wide knife to create the flat surface as you remove the excess mud. Clean your knife between each sweep when you're using the wide knife as any debris (dried mud, sanding dust) that gets caught under the knife will drag across and mar your finished surface. No big deal if it does; just apply more mud and do it again, but better to save yourself the trouble.\n4. I was careful to avoid getting any mud on the ceiling, to the point of leaving the very tops of the joints unfilled. We will eventually tear this wall down and I don't want to spend days scraping mud and paint off the ceiling when that happens.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHN/PYES/IJYV3Q30/FHNPYESIJYV3Q30.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F88/SS6A/IJYV3Q3V/F88SS6AIJYV3Q3V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW3/6V8M/IJYV3Q4D/FW36V8MIJYV3Q4D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3L/O7GE/IJYV3Q4G/F3LO7GEIJYV3Q4G.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Step 2: Mudding"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "1. Wait 24 hours, and maybe a bit more. You'll know the mud is dry when it's an even white in color; taupe-colored mud is still wet. Mud shrinks and cracks as it dries when it's applied too thickly, so expect to see cracks down your bead lines. Don't panic (yet), but if you put the second coat on before the first coat is dry the first coat will continue to shrink and crack causing your second coat to shrink and crack as well.\n2. Sand off any major imperfections by hand (with your rubber sanding block) using 100 grit sandpaper. Remove any blobs of mud, and anything else sticking up from the surface of the mud. Dry mud sands very easily without much elbow grease, but don't forget your mask.\n3. Apply the second coat of mud, getting the mud as smooth as you possibly can both down the channel and also across the surface of the wall (where your boards might not be laid flat). Also put mud on any knots that have cracks in them - press on the mud and then sweep it off with the knife at a 45 degree angle. The mud should fill the crack but leave the rest of the knot's surface clear.\n4. Allow to dry.\n5. Evaluate whether you need a third coat. If you still see cracking or shrinkage, sand and apply a third coat in the same way.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYR/CMGX/IJYV3Q32/FYRCMGXIJYV3Q32.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Step 3: Wait, Reapply, Evaluate"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "1. Once all coats are up and dry, use 120 grit sandpaper to do a finish sand. Basically you want the mud to feel completely smooth under your fingers. Feather the edges of the mud so you see the boards through the mud and the mud just fills the scratches left by the first sanding. Try to eliminate any rough or raised spots along the channels between the boards. This is tough to do if you don't have a ton of experience (as I don't) but you can get it reasonably good. Remember that paint will not hide imperfections.\n2. Prime. Do not skip this step. The knots in knotty pine contain resin that bleeds through regular paint (ask me how I know this).\nI had half a can of Kilz primer left over from another project so I started with that, although I was quite surprised to see how much the boards showed through even after two coats. The primer looked white when it was wet, but the yellow showed through once it was dry. When the Kilz ran out I switched to Zinsser Smart Prime that my husband Alvin had picked up, which stayed more white after each coat was dry. I wanted the walls to be evenly colored before I started to paint as I only had a third of a can of leftover colored paint so I didn't want to have to do a lot of coats with that. I ended up putting four coats of primer on the big wall and five on the window wall, as I had to brush rather than roller on the window wall and it was hard to get the paint on thick enough.\n3. Paint. I had to put three coats on the big wall and four on the window wall before all the primer was covered and we could see the true paint color. After the first coat the walls looked lurid as the white primer was still showing through quite a lot.

Once you see the holes, typically, the top hole will be a little larger since it was made larger by the screw pulling out. The chopstick will be used to fill the hole.\nStart by placing the tip of the chopstick into the targeted hole. You are trying to achieve a fairly tight fit with the tapered end of the chopstick. To do this, start cutting the tip of the chopstick 1-2mm at a time and fit it into the hole. The cuts can be done with the fine-cut saw or pruners. You want to achieve a pretty tight fit with about 5mm of chopstick sticking into the hole. Once you achieve this tight fit, place a mark on the chopstick 2mm from the end of the hole. This step is the most important since you need to make sure the chopstick tip will be tight enough to secure the screw.\nCut the chopstick tip at the mark.\nPlace the chopstick tip into the hole. Ensure the tapered end goes in first.\nUse a hammer or back end of screwdriver, tap the chopstick tip into the hole until it is flush with the cabinet wall.\nUsing the hinge holes as a template, make a mark in the center and redrill the screw hole with an appropriate sized drill bit. The drill should be the size of the screw body.\nReinstall the hinge and check that the hinge is secure.

The part that piqued my interest was the information about the benefits of the papaya seeds and how a university study was done on apes for a natural male contraceptive. Papaya seeds are used as a pepper replacement, meat tenderizer,used to treat parasites, inflamed joints, and an aide for the digest system and a liver cleanse to name a few.\nSome people experience a skin rash when they touch the skins of the fruit or ingest the seeds. It is recommended to slowly add the seeds to your diet to help your body adjust. They have been known to cause a stomach ache with people who are sensitive to certain foods. The seeds can be added to smoothies and blended in a blender for a nutritional drink. The seeds can be dried and eaten but they do have a slight bitter taste. I have not tried them for seasoning a steak or food yet. I tried them in a smoothie and could not taste them but that don't mean you won't be able to. I only added 1/8 teaspoon because I did not know if it would give me a stomach ache or not. I have not had any problems nor has my husband. I dried them for my neighbor because she wanted them for a liver cleanse. I plan to dry more seeds and fruit for our use. It is well worth the health benefits to give them a try though.\nIn this instructable I will show you how to dry and store the seeds to use; for which purpose that interest you. If you are interested in using them for a male contraceptive, you could do an online search and get tested to be sure that it works for you, before you assume that it does! I received a comment from someone who got pregnant using the seeds as a contraceptive . There has been a university study, using them on some kind of ape and the results were amazing.There were no side effects except it lowered the sperm count in the apes but after weaning the apes from the seeds, over a period of time, the apes sperm count was normal. Not many studies have been done using the papaya seeds for a natural contraceptive because it is not profitable and if I recall the article mentioned plants can't be patented.

I use this cut begin most projects and it can be used with other cuts for a number of effects.\nThe edge cut uses the curve of the knife and is done by basically digging into the wood, the angle at which you dig in will determine the depth of the cut. this one is good for removing a lot of wood and is also used with other cuts for specific effects.\nThe round cut uses the flat of the blade and is used mostly to round corners, you can use the curve of the blade to do this in tight spaces but the flat gives you better control. This cut is also good for removing a lot of wood.\nThe hole cut is the least used for most projects and is basically only used for making holes. it uses the point and you simply stab the point into the wood and twist it around until you have the hole depth and width you want.\nUsing a pocket knife for the first time is awkward, which is one reason working with scrap 2x4's is so nice, it's soft and often free.

Choose a 2x4 that doesn't have knots or is misshapen, or find a way to incorporate these blemishes into your work. Mine had a knot that looked like an eye so I planed that into my design. Some projects can be totally free spirited, but most will require some measuring. I wanted to display a treasured blue marlin sword that was given to me, so I started out by what length I thought would look good (ok, so I used a skill saw to get the length but other than that it was all pocket knife) and measuring how thick the groove would have to be for the sword to fit into it.\nThen I drew out the design I wanted; you can use pen or pencil, or won't matter since it's going to be carved off anyway. I cut the groove for the sword with the deepest line cuts I could manage and some pretty steep angled edge cuts. Then, using the line cut, I went over the entire design and began cutting it out to the desired depth with the edge cut on the outside and the hole cut and the edge cut in between the loops. once it was to the depth I wanted, I smoothed it out using the round cut, except for the face which I left with shaper edges.\nAt this point it just needs sanding, if you want you can use a dremel but that's kind of cheating or you could use sandpaper. But if you want you can use your knife to do it too, which I guess that means there is a fifth technique.

They have a great explanation of the science in this project. In it, you have four separate transparent sheets, and when you combine them and hold them up to a light, it becomes a recognizable image. Watching the colors combine is absolutely magical.

I first started with making the decorations (shown in the first picture):\nFrom your sheet of wood, cut a 13 x 13 cm piece.\nNext, we need to resaw this piece into thin slices; we only need two of them. Mine were about 2 mm thick. (Shown in the second picture. You'll need a bandsaw for this step. An alternative would be to directly buy a sheet of wood veneer, or to use a different material like a thin sheet of plastic.)\nOn a piece of paper, print or draw whatever decorative shape you'd like to cut out from the two slices. I chose a picture of a paw, but e.g. a silhouette of your pet would be nice too :)\nTo make sure the cutout looks the same in both slices, we need to temporarily stick them together. I used thin strips of double-sided tape for this (shown in the third picture).\nPut the paper with your shape on top of the two slices, and carefully cut out the shape from the paper with a utility knife (fourth picture). The goal here is to carve the shape directly onto the wood.\nOnce the shape is carved onto the wood, trace over the shape again with a pencil so you can see it a lot better (fifth picture).\nDrill a few starter holes into the parts that need to be cut out. Be sure to provide enough support underneath the wood to avoid breaking it while drilling.\nUse a scroll saw or coping saw to cut the shape out of the wood (sixth picture).\nCarefully pry apart your two slices again and remove the double-sided tape.\nFinally, use sandpaper and/or some small wood files to clean up the edges. Optionally, you can also use the sandpaper to add a subtle rounding effect to the edges.\nNotes:\nIt's best to use quite thin slices of wood to make these decorations: The thicker the wood, the more weight you add to the flap and the more force your pet will need to open it.

To add clamping force while the glue is drying, stack a few books, boxes, .. on top.\nNow glue the acrylic flap into the groove of the bottom hinge part. You can just let it dry by itself if you already have a snug fit; no clamps needed.\nWe still need something to connect the top and bottom hinge parts. I used a hacksaw to cut two 5 cm-long cylinders from a metal rod that I scavenged from an old scanner (fifth picture). You may need to clean up your cuts with some sandpaper or files.\nInsert the two cylinders and test whether your hinge works smoothly, and whether the flap is level relative to the top hinge part. If not, you can use some small wood files (or your drill) to carefully make small adjustments to the holes you've drilled.\nNotes:\nIt's okay that the hinge's cylinders can still slide/fall out at this point. Once the pet flap is installed in the door, they won't be able to get out.\nKeep in mind the diameter of the two cylinders that join the top and bottom hinge parts. (Mine have a 3 mm diameter.) The smaller the diameter, the more room the two hinge parts will have to rotate, but the bigger the gap will be between the two hinge parts. You'll want to keep this gap small; otherwise the pet flap won't work very well as thermal insulation.\nIf needed, you can use a small chisel to chip away a little more room in the notches of the top hinge part, so the hinge can rotate freely.\nTo make sure the decorations are positioned correctly, I made a quick L-shape on the bandsaw to help out (fourth picture).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHT/MTUP/IJKABPYR/FHTMTUPIJKABPYR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOA/8ANQ/IJKABVGV/FOA8ANQIJKABVGV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS3/O237/IJKABQNW/FS3O237IJKABQNW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP4/LPQ1/IJKABQ7W/FP4LPQ1IJKABQ7W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMM/WD0I/IJKABUJT/FMMWD0IIJKABUJT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Assembling the Pet Flap"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "We now have our pet flap, but we still need to attach it to the door. If you have a solid wooden door, you can just cut your hole in the door, and directly attach the pet flap to it. If you have a hollow core door (filled with a cardboard pattern inside), we'll first need to make a door frame (first picture):\nCutting a hole:\nIt's not really necessary, but I first removed the door from its hinges and laid it flat on my workbench. It's a bit more convenient to work with like this.\nUsing a pencil, ruler and try square, mark the rectangle you want to cut out of the door. This rectangle should be 20 x 17.2 cm, which is the size of the entire assembly, including the door frame. Note that the bottom side of the rectangle should roughly correspond to the height of your pet's belly, measured from the floor (when standing in a neutral position). This should give your critter easy access when walking through the flap.\nInside each corner of the rectangle, drill a starter hole. From these starter holes, use a jigsaw to cut the rectangle out of the door (third picture). It's okay if the cut looks a little rough; it will be covered up by the door frame anyway.\nInner part of the door frame: (measurements shown in the fourth picture)\nCut two 19 x 0.5 x D cm pieces of wood, and two 17.2 x 0.5 x D cm pieces (where D is the thickness of the door).\nUse wood glue to make a 20 x 17.2 cm rectangular shape out of the four pieces, as shown in the fifth picture. Be sure to test that the corners are square when the glue dries.\nSlide the rectangular shape into the door's hole. If the hole isn't quite big enough, use a rasp to make small adjustments until you get a snug fit.\nIf the shape sticks out of the door a bit too much, you can make adjustments with a chisel (sixth picture).\nOuter parts of the door frame: (measurements shown in the seventh picture)\nThe outer parts of the door frame essentially look like two picture frames that cover both sides of the door, and will prevent the inner part from moving around. To make these picture frames, first cut four 22 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm pieces, each with 45\u00b0 cuts on both ends. (If you're cutting these by hand, you can use a mitrebox to make the 45\u00b0 angled cuts.)\nLikewise, cut four 19.2 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm pieces, again with 45\u00b0 cuts on both ends.\nUsing wood glue, attach the pieces to make two 22 x 19.2 cm picture frames (eighth picture). Be sure to test that the corners are square while the glue dries. I also added some weights on top of the corners just to have a little bit of clamping force.\nOnce the glue has dried, and with the inner part of the door frame still in place, the picture frames can be attached to the door with a few small nails (first picture). Because these picture frames are rather thin, they're also very fragile when hammering in nails. If you have a teeny-tiny drill bit laying around, it's a good idea to pre-drill the holes before hammering in the nails.\nNotes:\nThe outer parts of the door frame are only 0.3 cm thin purely because I like how it looks; you can make'em thicker just as well :)\nFor additional strength, you can glue (one of) the picture frames to the door frame's inner part. Likewise you can also glue the picture frames to the door, in addition to the nails. I haven't done any of this so I can still easily take the entire pet flap apart in case I ever need to make any repairs. (The pet flap is holding out fine without the glue so far.)\nThe inner part of the door frame could also be made stronger by creating e.g. a box joint between the pieces. Then again, this inner part is already supported on all four sides by the door itself, so it's not really necessary.\nNote that the door frame's measurements provide 1 mm of slack between the pet flap and the door frame, to make sure the flap can move freely.\nWhen attaching the outer parts of the door frame with nails, it's best to stay away from any knots in the wood grain! I managed to break my picture frames twice when attempting to hammer a nail near them. I ended up glueing the pieces back together, hiding the holes I made with some saw dust + wood glue, then adding the nails elsewhere, avoiding any knots.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FO7/A6IL/IJKABVO8/FO7A6ILIJKABVO8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIO/N8VM/IJKABVRV/FION8VMIJKABVRV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHH/4RS4/IJKABWGT/FHH4RS4IJKABWGT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQL/4KBR/IJNM4HNW/FQL4KBRIJNM4HNW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE6/X2L1/IJNM4FNZ/FE6X2L1IJNM4FNZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR1/A7IA/IJKABW57/FR1A7IAIJKABW57.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUG/2E37/IJKABVVI/FUG2E37IJKABVVI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZA/KTRH/IJKABVW8/FZAKTRHIJKABVW8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Making a Door Frame"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Almost there!

(If possible, drill some pilot holes in the door frame as well.)\nReconnect the top and bottom hinge part and reinsert the two cylinders.\nFinally, using a screwdriver, screw the pet flap onto the door frame (fourth picture).\nAll done; the pet flap is ready for action! If all is well, the pet flap can move freely without touching the door frame. Time to put your flap to the ultimate test and see what your pet thinks of your handiwork :)\nNotes:\nIn case the flap is scraping against the door frame, you can still take it apart and file/sand down the acrylic flap until it can move freely.\nIf needed, you can always add some sort of bolt lock to be able to lock the pet flap in one or both directions.\nNote that I haven't added any wood finish to this project.

Are you an audiophile who has a fair amount of gear but no good place to mount it? There's nothing that adequately stacks your gear and allows you to maximize the space that you have, right? Well fret no more! I have a solution that may work as well for you as it did for me. Allow me to introduce my IKEA Kvissle Letter Tray Mini Rackable Shelf System. The entire cost of this very handy DIY is just under $25 (not including drill bits and tools). If properly configuring and placing your gear has been bothering you for quite some time, then read on friends!\nNOTE: I tried to build a second version today using what I learned from the first attempt. However, I quickly realized that my drill was not built to handle the bit I needed. Therefore, instead of delaying this instructable any further, I'd rather get it out to you guys using the photos I have from the first and second attempts combined and fill in the gaps with content. Where appropriate, I will note where issues arose so that you can avoid the pitfalls I ran into. As soon as I get a proper drill and bit, I'll finish the second version and upload the missing photos.\nItems You Will Need\nIKEA Kvissle Letter Tray: I've tried using others including the Dokument series (which by the way, offers a lot of air flow if your devices run hot) and something from Target which didn't offer any airflow, but the Kvissle has been the best one going for me. One of the best things about the Kvissle is that it fits nicely in a 12\" x 12\" space, which seems to be a very common theme amongst IKEA products.\nAssorted Grommets: Depending upon the size of the holes that you require, you might want to get a set of assorted grommets. This way you can cover your bases for whatever your needs may be. For those of you who are not intimately familiar with the layout of a Lowe's or HomeDepot, these grommets tend to be scattered throughout the store. Typically they are found either in the plumbing or the electrical department. If you can find these online, you're probably better off buying them there.\nAT LEAST a 3/4-inch Drill Bit: I say \"at least\" because this is one of those pitfalls I mentioned above. I started with this exact drill bit for the 3/4-inch grommet not taking into account the thickness of the rim of the grommet itself. Make sure to get a drill bit slightly larger than the inner diameter. For example, if you're planning on using the 3/4-inch grommet, you'll need a 1-inch drill bit AND most likely a 1/2-inch drill.\n#2 Pencil: Yep.

Before you screw the wheels in place make sure that they are properly aligned.\nNow get the cutting tool between the L shaped metal bars, lock it in place with the screw and bolt. (my cutting tool came with a handle attached, to remove the handle just pull the metal part away from the handle, this is good! you can put the piece back again if you need to cut flat glass). Place this arrangement in the wood plank and, with the help of a bottle, position it; the importance of this resides in the fact that the cutting tool should be perpendicular to the surface of the bottle, so make sure it has a perfect 90 degree angle before you lock it in place.\nFinally, put a small wood plank at the top so the bottle won't go back and forward when you spin it.

With your other hand spin the bottle. Try to get the most straight line possible, a nice and sharp cut will be continuous and get to the same place where you started, if you have to make a second pass, it will probably end up in bad results. Check the cut itself, it should be a non-interrupted straight line, this is crucial for the next step.\nLight up the candle and spin the bottle's cut 1cm above it. The idea here is to evenly distribute the heat in the line of cut. Make this for around 2 to 3 minutes, then dip the bottle into the water (some people use cold water, ambient temperature water works as well). You should hear a cracking sound. Carefully rise the bottle, at this point it may break if you apply some force, or hit it gently with another bottle. Be careful and don't cut yourself. If the bottle doesn't divide try the candle step again.\nOnce you have the two pieces you may want to check there is not any crack in the surface (if there is, it will break sooner or later). If the borders are too irregular you can use the pliers to take out some small pieces. Place your sandpapers in a flat surface and then pour some water on them (water helps in the grinding process and prevents glass dust to spread all over the place). Spin the borders of the bottle in the 80 grit sandpaper, also tilt it 45 degrees to sand the outer part of the border. Repeat the process with the 240 sandpaper, grab a piece of it to sand the inner wall of the border.

Carefully fold on the dotted lines as this will help ensure a good fit later on. Time to actually begin!\nSteps:\n1. Cut your 36 inch 2x4 into one 14 inch and 22 inch piece. Make sure your ends are square. If your sizes are a bit smaller or larger that is okay too.\n2. You\u2019ll want to first do the three 35 degree cuts. If you have a miter saw you can use that instead of the templates. Place the templates so your 14 inch piece (the base) are parallel with each other.\n3. Make one 35 degree cut into the 22 inch top piece. Your product should now look like image three.\n4. Place and trace the bottom template as to have the narrow portion facing FWD. You\u2019ll be cutting out the center of this piece. Note: 2x4 wood generally has rounded edges so you might not be able to align your template without some visual adjustment.\n5.

You have to angle the saw blade as to follow all three sides of the wood. It can be a little tricky the first time you do this but go slow and let the blade do the cutting.\nTo cut out the center section you can use your Coping saw to quickly remove it without having to chisel extensively. Remember to follow your marks on both sides! It\u2019s okay to leave a little extra and chisel it out. Your Base of the coffee maker is now all done!\nSteps Top Cut-out:\nCut-out the sides following all three lines for each of the four cuts you\u2019ll make.\nCheck the fit with the base. It should be slightly snug but easy enough to put and take apart with ease. If not, adjust either the top or base accordingly.\nTop Funnel Construction:\nAssemble both pieces and set it on a flat level surface. You should notice that your assembly will tip forward. Don\u2019t worry! It\u2019s a good thing because you precisely tune the balance. Remove 0.5 inch to 1 inch of material at a time until it balances on it\u2019s own. Mine would tip forward at 21.5 inch in length but not at 20.5 inches. It should be around 20 inches if the construction all went to plan.\nWith the maker assembled, place pressure on the top at various point to figure out where the most stable far right point is. This is where you\u2019ll want to place your pilot hole for your funnel. It should be a point just to the right of the angled base leaving you sufficient space for your coffee mug. Mine was 10 inches from the left hand angle.\nUsing whatever method you prefer, carve out a funnel shape into the wood. I didn\u2019t have proper tools to make a smooth funnel but carving it out with the coping saw might be a good option.\nOptionally, you can coat your 2x4 coffee maker with butcher block conditioner / oil for a nicer finish and prevent coffee stains.\nCongratulations!

Video #2, buildcult, is the long educational 20 minute version. I'd recommend watching the short version first, before reading this instructable, so that you have a visual reference. I did my best to make it worth 7 minutes of your life. I conceived this project for the Brave the Elements contest, which you can vote in here, hint hint.\nThe goal is to build a kiln from natural materials in order to burn and slake lime for seashells. Lime is immensely valuable! If lime disappeared tomorrow, civilization would fall hard! It is the main ingredient in cement and can be used to make mortar and plaster. It can also be used in the arts for limewash and fresco, in soap making, mixed with casein (milk protein) to make pre-industrial waterproof glue and paint, for smelting and refining metal, and to remove hair and prepare skins for rawhide, hide glue or tanning. Ever read the ingredients on your tortillas or tortilla chips and seen \u201ctraces of lime\u201d? That\u2019s because lime is used in processing corn kernels to make tortillas, hominy and grits, which is easy to do at home. Not only does it make corn more nutritious and digestible, but it also lends to the unique flavor of those products. Beet sugar is processed with lime too. Lime is also used to potentiate certain drug substances such as betel nut and coca leaves, a small bit of lime being chewed with the plant material to activate it. So, yeah, wow, lime is one of the most useful substances ever!\nA WORD ON SAFETY: A lot of people think that lime is some deadly scary chemical that will burn you face off. It\u2019s not\u2026 not really... well, maybe. Quick lime is dangerous, but that is a brief transient state. During slaking, the quicklime will give off heat and boil vigorously, so that is dangerous since the stuff can splatter around and is not only hot, but also highly alkaline. So, yeah, okay, maybe doing a face plant in a boiling tub of quicklime may burn your face off. Don\u2019t do that! Otherwise, the stuff is not that horrible, and people have been making tortillas, mixing mortar, plastering walls and tanning leather without goggles and hazmat suits for a very long time. It is also non-toxic. You definitely don\u2019t want your pets drinking lime water or your kids playing with lime, but that is due to it\u2019s concentration mostly, and not to inherent toxicity. When diluted, it becomes less and less caustic and is at some point completely harmless. Once converted to calcium carbonate by drying, it\u2019s just like egg shells, sea shells or stone, not only non-toxic, but actually used as a calcium supplement. So, don\u2019t get it in your eyes, keep it away from children and pets, be careful when slaking and use common sense and everything will be fine. It will temporarily dry skin though skin though, so be aware of that.\nBefore we get to the fun stuff, let me explain how this works. Don\u2019t be intimidated by the chemistry terms, they aren\u2019t important. The changes lime goes through have a name, The Lime Cycle. By heating stone or shells red hot, about 900 Celcius (called calcining), we can change lime from it\u2019s stable inert form, calcium carbonate, into Calcium oxide. Calcium oxide, aka Qucklime, is the most unstable and highly reactive form of lime. Quicklime reacts violently with water, giving off tremendous heat and boiling vigorously. This reaction with water makes it into Calcium Hydroxide, which is similar to lye, but not as strong. This is the form that is used the most in the arts and industries mentioned above. If the lime is kept under a layer of water, it will not only keep forever, but it improves with age! This stuff is called lime putty. You may be more familiar with the dry lime you can buy in a bag, which is dry calcium hydroxide. This bagged powdered hydrated lime is widely available, but inferior to wet slaked lime putty. You can hardly buy lime putty, and it is very expensive, but you can make it! For more on the forms of lime see my article, Understanding Lime.\nBasically, lime putty is like liquid rocks. Once it is allowed to dry with exposure to air, it absorbs carbon from the atmosphere and turns back into a hard rock (or shell, which is pretty much the same thing). Think about that for a second. That is awesome!\nAnd thus the lime cycle is completed from rock or shell, to quicklime, to lime putty, and back to rock/shell.\nIn my book, it doesn't get much funner than burning and slaking lime, so lets get this party started!", "title": "Burn Seashell Lime in a Primitive Straw/Clay Kiln!", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Burn-Seashell-Lime-in-a-Primitive-StrawClay-Kiln/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The pet straw/clay kiln is so simple you could do it with almost no real tools, except maybe something to carry water, it would just take longer. A wheelbarrow is nice to mix in, but you could also just use a bucket or tub. A shovel is good for digging clay. Maybe some tools to cut and split wood.\nSTRAW: You need a type of straw that is flexible enough to curve around the kiln body. I prefer my wild straw, but bale straw from the feed store works fine too. Don't use hay. You want the hollow stems of the straws, not the flat grass blades which compose much of a bale of hay.\nCLAY: Clay or high clay soil is need to make clay slip for the kiln. Try to dig down at least past the top 6 inches of the soil. In many clay soil areas, there will be heavier clay about 1 foot down. Mix the clay with water. If dry, try to soak it for at least a day or two if possible. Mix by hand, squishing the clay between your fingers, or use a paint mixer shaft in an electric drill. Use less water than you think you\u2019ll need. You can always add more! Make the slip thick, like a thin batter. When dipped, a lot of clay should stick to the grass leaving a good coating on each straw. Lumps, bumps and sand are no problem as long as the consistency is right.\nFUEL: I have used all different kinds of scrappy wood for firing lime kilns. Use anything that is dry and not soggy or so rotten that it is very light in weight. pine cones, dead bark, nut shells, twigs, sticks and of course just plain old firewood are fine. You do want a proportion of small stuff in there as well as enough big stuff to keep the fire hot for a while.\nWe are dealing with two basic factors here-\nTemperature: the shells or stone must reach a certain temperature to calcine.\nDwell time: The temperature must be maintained long enough to thoroughly penetrate and finish the job.\nHaving enough fuel and enough air flow will give you adequate temperature and having a large enough mass of wood, with some of it in larger pieces, will give you dwell time. (BTW, it is hard to drive the temperature of wood too high, certainly not without forced air.)\nI don't use wood much over 2 inches in diameter in these small kilns. Use some around 2 inches, some small stuff to spread the fire and keep it moving, and a bunch in between. There's no need to over think it.\nYou can also use already prepared charcoal. Using charcoal will almost eliminate smoke, making this process accessible to backyard pyros who live in populated areas.\nFeedstock can be either limestone or shells.\nSHELLS: As far as I know, any shells will work. With shells, you know what you are getting, very high calcium lime, known as FAT LIME.\nLIMESTONE: Limestone varies in composition and may contain either useful or un-useful impurities. High magnesium is common in limestone, but it has similar properties and magnesium limes can be used in building. I guess it either works or it doesn't. Just burn whatcha got and see if it works. I don\u2019t have a lot of experience with limestone, because it is rare in these parts. The thicker the stone is, the more dwell time it requires, so break limestone up into smaller pieces. I try not to use any stone much over about 2 inches thick and I think smaller is probably better in a small kiln.\nCHALK, CORAL AND MARBLE: Are other materials that are sometimes burned to make lime.\nFOR SLAKING: After burning, the lime is slaked in water. You'll need a ceramic, galvanized metal or wooden vessel. A galvanized tub is good. A stainless stock pot will work for small amounts. The slaking lime gets very hot, so don't use plastic. You also need boiling water and a long stick to stir with so you can stay well back from the boiling splattering lime.\nSTORING: The finished lime should be stored in a container with a tight lid to keep it wet. A five gallon bucket with a lid is perfect.\nCAMERA: You need a camera so you can take pictures or videos to show me later!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOF/TWEN/IJQ0C9MI/FOFTWENIJQ0C9MI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSX/LI88/IJQ0CPS2/FSXLI88IJQ0CPS2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFG/KMWX/IJQ0C9RT/FFGKMWXIJQ0C9RT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKB/SPQ7/IJQ0C9FG/FKBSPQ7IJQ0C9FG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCD/M4C9/IJQ0C9Q2/FCDM4C9IJQ0C9Q2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCB/QBL6/IJQ0C9G1/FCBQBL6IJQ0C9G1.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: TOOLS AND MATERIALS"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The kiln of straw and clay we'll be using has been given the name \u201cThe Pet\u201d by my friend Yoshi because it\u2019s shoooo cuuutte and fuzzy looking! awwwwwwww! It was inspired by a clay/straw wattle system innovated by my friend Michael Smith, author natural builder and author of The Hand Sculpted House. It turns out that he was inspired by a system used to build granaries in Mexico, similar to what I\u2019m doing with the pet kiln. The granaries are structures of coiled bundles of straw mixed with clay. My concept was to create some insulation by using a lot of straw. There is a large proportion of straw in the kiln, which may seem foolhardy. I know, I was skeptical that my own idea would even work till I tried it. It is not idiotic, I swear, it just has to be considered in context. This is a temporary kiln. I believe the one I used the most lasted for 8 burns. The one I built for this has done three burns and looks like it could do a lot more. The clay protects the fibers to an extent and when heated cooks into something like pottery. Each burn erodes the kiln wall a little until holes appear and it\u2019s time to build another one. The kiln may be dead, but the kiln fragments make a valuable soil amendment along with the ashes, lime fragments and any charcoal that is left. Burnt clay has a long history of use in soils. My last pet is buried in my saffron flower bed. I\u2019ve found roots growing through the holes in the fragments, so apparently they like it!\nPerhaps Using a larger proportion of clay may make a more durable kiln.\nHaving used a metal drum a lot to burn lime, I found that any shell near or touching the metal would not calcine completely, thus creating a large percentage of waste. The pet has insulation and mass, or at least conducts heat more slowly, resulting in a higher ratio of burned to un-burned shells. The mass absorbs heat and once up to temperature, should theoretically moderate the environment within the kiln by reflecting heat back into the interior creating a more even and probably higher all around, temperatures. A thin metal drum radiates heat rapidly outward and cools very fast, losing half of it's energy to the outside air. You often have to stand back from the red hot drum, while I can put my hand on the outside of the pet, even when it\u2019s in full inferno mode.\nTo summarize, the pet is temporary, but it is fast and simple to build with materials that are commonly available, it does it's job well and the burned out shell of the kiln is a good soil amendment. And it's adorable! You can do the same burn in a thin metal drum with the top and bottom removed, or similar structure, but expect 15% or more of under-burned shells.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKO/W9A4/IJQ0C9RB/FKOW9A4IJQ0C9RB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKQ/P387/IJQ0C9KN/FKQP387IJQ0C9KN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL3/R39W/IJQ0C9H0/FL3R39WIJQ0C9H0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGS/UB0V/IJQ0DNBT/FGSUB0VIJQ0DNBT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: ABOUT THE PET KILN"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Remember, keep the slip like a thin batter and add water or clay as necessary.\nYou need air vents. For this pet, I used half rounds of dried bark that supported the arch while it dried, but still allowed airflow. Another option is to dig a trench and cover it with a small board. Build the kiln over the board and it will leave a way for air to get under and into the kiln. By the time the bark or board burns up, the kiln will be dry enough to be self supporting.\nI like to make the kilns with a belly, like a long pear shape. My fire intuition tells me that this shape will hold heat better and reflect more heat off of the curved walls and back into the center of the kiln. Also, the venturi effect may come into play when air moves from the large interior, through the narrow neck, and out into the large space of the open again causing an acceleration. That is all theoretical, but it looks cooler than a straight sided kiln anyway. It is also a pretty common shape for kilns off all sorts.\nFire intuition also tells me that the kiln should have a minimum height to width ratio. I\u2019m not sure what the ideal is, but it should be taller than it is wide. Even taller is fine I believe, just not too short and wide.\nThe thicker the walls are, the longer the kiln will last. You can build them surprisingly thin if care is taken, but less so if the kiln walls curve outward. Don\u2019t wring the clay out of the straw. You can squeeze it lightly, but the idea is to have the straw completely coated without any big air spaces in the body of the kiln. You should see clay both sticking to the individual straws after dipping, and also being held like water in a sponge between the straws. If the slip is very thin, the straws will barely be coated and the slip will all run right out of the straw \"sponge\" instead of adhering.\nHave fun!

Definitely not more than 30% shells. I would recommend erring on the side of more wood at first, and then experiment with skimping to see what you can get away with. I usually use a mix of wood sizes, and rarely anything much over about 2 inches in diameter. Using some small stuff mixed in gets each wood layer off to a fast start, while the larger pieces give you a longer burn time to make sure the material is heated all the way through.\nYou can either load the kiln and light it, or light a fire and then add layers gradually.\nWhether loading gradually or all at once, the wood must be stacked loosely enough to allow air to travel up through the kiln. A criss cross pattern is good, with space between each piece of wood. You want to fit in a lot of wood, but if you pack it in tightly, the burn will be sluggish.\nIf loading the kiln gradually, start a fire in the bottom and get it going very well before adding shells. Use quite a bit of wood so that the shells will be left resting on a large coal bed. Add a layer of shells or limestone, but not too thick The limestone or shells may very well start exploding right away, so be careful. Immediately add a layer of wood. If you stick around to manage the fire, adding one layer at a time as each previous layer begins to burn cleanly, you can lessen the amount of smoke, but not by that much. I usually set the kiln up and light it, then add a few more layers as the kiln burns down.\nTo load all at once, put a layer in the bottom that is neatly stacked and designed to light quickly and spread the fire rapidly. Use a log cabin criss cross design with lots of small splinters and twigs worked in. Other good additions are the fluff from cattail reed seed heads, shredded bark, dry grass and pitch saturated wood from conifer trees. Around and on top of this put a good layer of wood, enough to form a nice coal bed on the bottom, and then add a layer of shells. Add another layer of wood with some large and some small fuel, then more shells. Continue layering, maintaining your 1:3 proportion of shells to wood until within about 6 inches of the top, Cap off with a nice layer of wood. The last wood layer can be mounded over the top of the kiln in such a way that it will fall in as the contents burn and sink. If you prepared your base fire well, it should be easy to light the fire, but you may have to make some kind of little torch or something to shove into one of the vent holes. If it is hesitant to light, insert a glob of burning pine pitch.\nYou can keep adding alternate layers of shells/limestone and wood until you start running out of room. Just be sure to put a hefty layer of wood on each layer, including the final one. When you are done, simply allow the kiln to burn out. If rain is an issue, cover the kiln.

Smoke is basically fuel, it just needs the right conditions to burn off.\nOnce the contents settle down, you can begin adding more layers of shells and wood. Start each layer with some new wood, followed by shells and a cap of wood. Adding one layer at a time will reduce smoking a little bit. You can just keep adding shells and wood as long as there is room, but always leave each layer with a good cap of wood.\nAllow the kiln to die and go out.

When it comes to shells, it is fairly obvious what is and is not burned thoroughly. You don't absolutely have to sort burned shells, but I prefer to. Shells are sometimes hesitant to slake and having a proportion of under-burned shells, while it may or may not hurt very much, certainly won't help. Also, for most uses, you'll probably want to sift off dirt, ashes and fragments of the kiln wall anyway, so it's easy enough to toss aside under-burned shells while you're already sifting through the remains.\nUnder-burned shells will have a grayish cast to them, or may be gray or black inside. Sometimes you can break off well burned parts for your good pile. No need to obsess. No matter what, there will be plenty of little bits of un-slaked stuff, but we'll screen all that out later, so just pull out the obvious ones.\nGet a container for the well calcined shells and a container to put everything else in. All of the other stuff, charcoal, burned clay, ashes and chips of shell or limestone are valuable first rate fertilizers or soil amendments! If you already have highly alkaline soil, you may want to avoid lime and ashes, but those soils are the exception rather than the rule.

Hot things are dangerous! Not only that, but it is a caustic substance, so that's doubly bad. Absolutely, do not get this stuff in your eyes! Keep children and pets away. Once slaked, lime is less dangerous, but still better keep kids out of it since, frankly, the stuff looks good enough to eat.\nIf slaking shells, heat some water. Stone seems to do okay with cold water, but shells are hesitant to slake and need a jump start. Once they get going, the reaction will usually create plenty of heat and you can start to add cold water. If you add too much cold water, you can stall the process. You can also stall the process by not adding enough water, because the water is the catalyst. For your first time, I'd have a large quantity of hot water to make sure you keep the ball rolling. The quicklime will use up a lot of water, so be ready with several times the quantity of water as you have shells to slake.\nIf the lime is well burned and fresh, it may start to hiss and react immediately. Other times it may take a little while to get going. After it really begins to react, be sure to keep adding water as it is used up. If the water level gets low the slaking will slow down. Keep stirring the lime as it slakes, to insure expose of all areas to adequate water.\nEventually, the slaking will really slow down. Make sure it is pretty wet and you can leave it for 30 minutes or so to finish up.\nDry hydrated lime is made by wetting quicklime in the open air. The quicklime will swell and crumble to a powder.

The hardest part of this project was cutting a hole in the wall, as it had a layer of plastic coated foam inside the wall which would melt when cut with a jigsaw and clog up the blade.\nAfter a lot of cursing in the 40 degree heat the hole was finally cut and the cooler unit was lift onto the IBC container. The 12 volt pump was dropped into the bottom of the IBC and the hose connected to the piping that send water to the pads. The drain from unit was connected next an it goes back into the IBC tank\nThe speed controller wiring and switch were hooked up and connected to the 12volt battery bank. The system was turned on and it was soon blowing cool air inside. One of the problems with 12 volts is the voltage drop over distance, so the fan was only getting around 7 volts due the battery bank been about 12 meters away. So the fan wasn't moving as much air as expected, so I gave the resident the option of either use heavy wiring, or putting a battery close to the cooler unit and connecting a solar panel to it.\nHe choose to run heaver wiring, and as he's always strapped for cash we run 2 extension cords(1 for +and 1 for -) from the battery bank to the cooler, not perfect but much better than the other crappy wiring he had. We ended up with 11 volts at the fan, not perfect but Ok for what i had to work with.\nI like to leave projects like this a little unfinished so the resident, can take so ownership and help them selves a bit. His imagination is quite good and after toying with the idea of a toilet seat.... he came up with a plastic drum lid to blank of the air con when not in use and to tidy up the hole in the wall. He also had the task of sealing the gap between the fan and the wall which he did with some old foam rubber.\nIn conclusion\nIf you live of grid in an area with low humidity this project is well worth the time effort, both coolers use about 100 watts of power running flat out, but the amount of water they use is quite significant.The performance of both coolers is very good in fact almost the same as a cooler running on 240 volts.\nThe tread mill motor version is slightly better as it defiantly moves more air for the same amount of power and is quieter, so if you can find a dead treadmill that would be the version I would advise you to make.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ2/NYGG/IJBTY2R3/FQ2NYGGIJBTY2R3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG6/YLVS/IJBTY2PR/FG6YLVSIJBTY2PR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRO/DJCH/IJBTY2NQ/FRODJCHIJBTY2NQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1N/6J8N/IJ1RQ33K/F1N6J8NIJ1RQ33K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F73/UGGH/IJ1RQ371/F73UGGHIJ1RQ371.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF0/UFIK/IJBTY2M9/FF0UFIKIJBTY2M9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYX/JSS6/IJAEJV0U/FYXJSS6IJAEJV0U.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: The Installation"}], "channel": "Homesteading"}, {"category": "Home", "description": "Turn your favorite photo into a fun piece of Andy Warhol inspired pop art!", "title": "Let's Make Warhol Art!", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Lets-Make-Warhol-Art/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Watch the Quick Tutorial Here!"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Your image printed out on transparent paper (Acetate)\n*I use PicMonkey to alter my images\nAmericana Acrylics\nSmall canvases\nAllure Dimensional Design Adhesive Paint\nE-6000 Spray Adhesive\nPaintbrushes", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F14/4GX8/IJQ0D3U1/F144GX8IJQ0D3U1.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Stuff You'll Need"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "1.

The device can be installed inside or outside of a shower stall or bathtub. The main components are a pump, sand and activated carbon filters and a UV-lamp. The system weighs around 20kg and is made from transparent acrylic, steel or plastic pipe connectors and copper, plastic or rubber tubing.\nThe total cost of the most simple version has cost me around 600\u20ac (~$655 US) depending on availability and pricing of local materials and the components used.\nThe filters can last as long as two years (but more like 1 year) with daily use but depends on the behaviour and general dirtiness of the user/s. The sand filter can be washed, the activated carbon or AC can be regenerated but only at high temperatures > 500 degrees C or composted and the UV lamp should last for thousands of hours but can be recycled and replaced like any other CFL.\nThe basic build of Showerloop is incredibly modular in terms of placement, materials selection and aesthetics. The only constraints come from the ideal filter dimensions and the power output of the UV lamp both of which are explored in the bachelor thesis ShowerMagic : A Hygienic and Eco-Efficient Real Time Greywater Reuse System for Showers found here: https://www.theseus.fi/handle/10024/76148\n\nIf you will build, built or are manufacturing Showerloop's or something based on this document please help us to continue working on it by donating to us, buying the KIT or parts or otherwise partnering with us. Without your support we will work our butts off to help you save the world!\n\nBecause the water should always be cleaned 100% or as close as possible the table NTU Reduction (%) above should be consulted if using different dimensions for the filter. NTU stands for Nephelometric Turbidity Units. It is a unit of measurement for the amount of particles floating in water. Drinking water has a value under 10 NTU, generally around 4 and visibly dirty water has an NTU over 15-20. NTU is measured chemically or optically. We have some design ideas for an open-source sensor, or several and would like some making them.\nAlthough technically a 10W UV lamp can be sufficient for the removal of E.coli which is used as an indicator of water quality, other bacteria and viruses are much more potent and so we chose to use very high concentrations of UV light in order to create a safety buffer. According to our research the powerful lamp is more than sufficient in removal of bacteria even when the filters fail which means that even if the water looks, feels or tastes funny there shouldn\u2019t be adverse health effects due to microbial action. If it does though, then it\u2019s time to check, maintain or replace the filters. Using multiple UV lamps might be a good way to both ensure that the water is always bacteria free and all excess heat goes into maintaining water temperature.", "title": "Showerloop", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Showerloop/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "PARTS\nSee poc21 component list above\n\nSKILLS\nlaser cutting, CNC or manual routing\npipe working skills or handling rubber tubing\nbasic proficiency in building and assembling things\nbasic understanding of how water flows\npatience and determination\n\nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS\none or two people\na working shower\nseveral square meters of workspace\nbasic power tools, hand tools and the ability to use them\ntowels (there will be water everywhere in the beginning!)\n\nDIFFICULTY LEVEL\nMEDIUM - HIGH : Anyone with a DIY mentality can do it\nTIME\n10+ hours finding materials\n1-3 hours laser cutting\n1-3 hours pipe bending\n2 hours assembling filters\n2 hours connecting piping\n2 hours for mounting\n2 hours for electronics assembly\n20 hours for everything we forgot... fixing leaks and other stuff\ntotal = 22-42+ hours, with the kit 4-12 hours (and way less hassle)\n\nCOST\nMaterial costs= ~600 +- 300 Euros (~$655 US)\nTools if you don\u2019t have them ~200 - 300 Euros (~$275 US)\ngeneral costs for material\ncosts for special services such as Laser cutter or CNC.

Here are two different ways of setting it up. The first one is the most simple build (simply called 'Simple'). The only down side is that the filters quite wide with a 20mm tube with compression disks and lids also made to fit this. For this instructable I'll be going through the 'Showerloop POC21' version because it was designed and built at the POC21 innovation camp (poc21.cc for more information) in France. I had an amazing experience and met awesome people that have really contributed to the project and making this Instructable possible. The photos shown, are from there.

Generally red / hairlines (0.001mm) is for cutting and black is for engraving.\n!If you don\u2019t have access to a laser cutter or CNC machine, a manual router can be used to cut out the groove in the filter and the whole shape if need be. To cut a perfect circle with a router a special tool may need to be made (look for circle jig on youtube).\nThe lids and mounting plates can also be a single piece if you are using thick material. Four 10cm diameter x 50cm filters are required to have an appropriate flow rate of 10l/min. With 6.6l/min two filters are sufficient and 1 filter for 3.3l/min. The surface area is more important than the length of the filter because that determines the flow rate through the filter and thus reaction times. I use 10mm thick acrylic sheets for the lid and compression disks but I have used 4-5mm acrylic sheets in previous prototypes and glued them together with decent results.\n\nA CNC machine is preferable and much, much faster.\nAbout laser cutting: People usually only think of laser cutters being able only to etch text or a picture or to cut through a material, but playing around (carefully that is) with the settings on the laser cutter you can basically mill into a material with millimetre precision. Be warned etching deep into acrylic is probably the slowest thing you can do and making a lid can take up to two hours or more once you have figured out the ideal settings. >> Settings for Aalto FABLAB EPILOG LEGEND EXT - 60 Watts: VECTOR: POWER= 100%, SPEED= 2%, FREQUENCY= 5000 Hz, ENGRAVE= POWER=100%, SPEED=8% (etch away around 4mm), FREQUENCY= 5000 Hz ! Be careful and minimize the flame size (there shouldn\u2019t be any).\n\nPARTS to CUT:\nLids for filter\nThere are 2 lids per filter, the top lid and bottom lid - duh.\nA hex nut is used to fasten the hose nipple (facing away from the filter) to the filter lid. The dimensions of hex nuts and/or hose nipples may vary regionally so it's best to get them first,check the measurements and modify the file if needed. In the picture of the lid only a circle was etched/milled into the acrylic lid to fit the hex nut but the design was later revised to have the shape of the hex nut itself, thereby fastening it to the lid so that it could no longer rotate (and prevent fastening) when adding the hose nipple on the outer side of the lid.\n\nCompression disks\nThere are 3 compression disks per filter. Two on both ends for squeezing in the sand and activated carbon and one in between the sand and activated carbon! The compression disk in the file is nested inside the void of the mounting plate to save materials!\n\nFabrics\n3 per filter. Width should be 10-15% larger than the inner width of the filter housing, in this case it's 115 mm. Lasercut (low power) or scissor cut the fabric membrane.\n\nLids for flow regulator\n\nThe flow regulators are just like the filters but with a single input and multiple outputs for the bottom flow regulator and vice versa for the top one.\nCaps for UV lamp\nThe cap is on the far right. A dip is etched into it to fit the hexnut/lock nut in the same way as in the filter lid. The Male-male brass union fastened to the UV cap is what allows the water tight connection between the UV lamp and piping. Special care should be taken with this UV cap because Acrylic will still let UV light through, while not included in the following picture sets the outer side of the cap should be coated in white paint (with titanium dioxide) or otherwise taped up so that you don't get exposed to the light directly.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FG1/RFWW/IGTYC7UI/FG1RFWWIGTYC7UI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCM/NIM4/IGTYCJ3H/FCMNIM4IGTYCJ3H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSX/KMZC/IGTYCJBM/FSXKMZCIGTYCJBM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRI/6Q29/IGTYCJI1/FRI6Q29IGTYCJI1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEN/PPKA/IIXFD993/FENPPKAIIXFD993.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: MAKE Components"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Cut the transparent acryclic pipe with a band saw if available or with a hand saw.\nThe filter housings should be 55 cm long and the flow regulator pipe should be around 10 cm long but shorter bits may work just as well and therefore require less water. The flow regulators can be left out of the build completely but there's something great about being able to see dirty water in the lower one get cleaned up by the filters and to get visual feedback in the top one which should be around eye height.\nTo get a straight cut the following videos are pretty helpful. The gist is to use lined up tape to get a perfect straight line around the pipe and cut around them. With a band saw you can use the leveller (aligning tool) to keep the cut straight. Because acrylic works a lot like wood you can level or adjust the cutting with sandpaper.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 5: Cut the Filter Housing Pipe"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "* This step can be skipped by milling a gasket out of silicone sheets with the same depth as the 'trough' in the lid. I don\u2019t have much advice on material selection (rubber or silicone) but there are specialist stores that could provide solid advice. I use silicone sheets. The material is best laser cut to the dimensions of the trough mentioned above. The .ai file can be found above (Gasket.pdf) Using a \u2018silicone gun\u2019 fill the circular trough with silicone up to the surface level. Use a plastic card such as a membership card you don\u2019t mind getting a bit dirty, and with force, slide the flat surface across and over the silicone. It\u2019s ok if it goes over or gets dirty as it can be cleaned later. Make sure that there are no bubbles or distortions in the silicone. The surface of the lid can now be cleaned toilet paper but avoid areas near the trough until it has hardened ~24 hours later. The silicone is easier to rub off once it\u2019s dry.\nUse a gasket or silicone in a similar fashion as mentioned above to connect the lower lids to the tubes. Fill the trough as mentioned in the steps above but instead of letting the material dry, press the cylinder into the lid, clamp together and then leave to dry (24 hours ideally). The silicone can be smoothed out with a gloved finger. This also reduces the surface area for bacteria or dirt to attach too. The water pressure is highest at the bottom of the filter, and so fusing the tube together with the lower lid is a good idea since it makes the seal extra strong.\nSo the top lids for the filters and flow regulators are the removable ones that are allowed to dry, but the lower lids can be sealed together. If you use a milled gasket the filters will hold up on their own without the need for any silicone, but assembly is easier when one side is attached. It's also possible to use acryclic glue and chemically bond the materials together, but usually costs a lot more than silicone.

This flow regulator is only connecting to two outputs. This whole step could be replaced by a simple 3-way t-connector, but seeing the dirty water enter the bottom flow regulator and clean water enter the top one is cool.\nThe tube is much shorter with 10 cm length and is glued with silicone to the lid. Filter connectors on the left, pump connector on the right. As pressure is higher on the input end, if you use silicone (instead of gaskets) it's best to glue the input side.\nThe lids and the mounting plates would probably survive being a single piece.

If the filter housing leaks when pumping water through the filter; the nuts need to be tightened more. If it still leaks check the alignment of the lids and the gaskets.

This mishap allowed for access to the back which is not very common and so modifications will be required for this step.\nBend copper pipes or just connect the hose\nBasics - heat up your copper pipe with a blowtorch. Focus the flame on the areas above and below where you will do the bending so that part doesn\u2019t get hotter and thus weaker than the rest of the steel. Once the copper turns blackish and starts making a cool psychedelic rainbow effect you know the copper is warm enough to begin bending. Turn off the flame and wait a moment. Once the pipe has cooled a little use the pipe bending tool so make an appropriate bend. This is more craft than technical skill and you just have to observe and see how the metal flexes. Don\u2019t put too much pressure on one spot, this may result in a distorted pipe. You want to keep the diameter of the inner pipe as even as possible. Use a pipe bending tool.\n+ hose connector Using rubber hose [or PEX] it is much easier than copper but perhaps it won\u2019t look as cool. Transparent tube isn\u2019t too bad but the most common material is PVC (which is kind of nasty). The best and perhaps easiest option is to use drinking water hose (16mm?). The hose connection is simple, use a hose nipple instead of the threaded connector and fasten the hose with a ring clamp. Make sure it\u2019s really right. For really easy access you can you quick release/ quick connectors that allow you to connect and disconnect individual components without twisting the tubes around. These are usually used with garden hoses and are available as plastic or metal pieces. There's a diagram of how to do this with hose earlier on.\nLay out all the filter components onto a surface. Using common sense and a ruler you can centre everything perfectly.\nOnce you're happy with the positions bend the pipe accordingly.\nTo help cut the pipe you can use a pipe cutting tool but the cheap ones get dull really quickly.\nFinally ready to test the filters by attaching a shower hose to the input and output of the flow regulators.\nThere's a short stop motion I'm having trouble embedding linked here: https://www.facebook.com/showerloop/videos/1703777059842454/\nThe placement of the filters was drawn onto a waterproof material and holes cut where the mount plates go through.\nThe mount plates can be bent by 90 degrees which would allow for the filters to be hung directly into the wall. To bend acrylic you need a special device that's basically a heated up wire that weakend specifically the bend point. Once it's warm enough you can just bend it by hand and into the shape you want (it's good to have a template that you can push up against). Let it cool and it will harden into shape. It may be prudent to space the holes in such a way that they screw in between tiles as drilling into tiles without cracking them can be tricky. If you have a basic cement wall you are good to go. Alternatively the threaded rod can be extended all the way from the ground to the roof and fastened with tension (pushing up and down) or simple legs or L-bends can be made so that they can be screwed into the roof and or floor.

Ideally some kind of glue would make the most sense.\nInsert the mount plates through the wall and using bolts or cut threaded rod, washers and nuts fasten the mount plate/filter or regulator to the wall. The holes where a bit too far out for the mount plates so there was too big of a gap to just use nuts to hold everything tightly together, so some 20mm plywood was cut and holes attached (in the same positions as the mount plates) to get a tight fit between the mount plate, plywood and wall.\nHere's a picture of Timm and the back wall in it's entirety. The black semi-circles are something that came with the UV-lamp which let's us mount it easily. Normally this would be on the inside of the shower but this version was so big it couldn't fit inside the shower horizontally. While smaller UV lamps of 20W should be sufficient for 10l/min the numbers seem to vary from supplier to supplier and I would lean on the side of caution. A cool set up could be to have a small UV pre filter and after the filter whereby the pre filter UV may be good enough to reduce or stop bacterial growth inside the filter all together which does occur even in drinking water filters, but the type of bacteria isn't harmful.

It can be seen in the picture on the right, next to the lock nut and brass union.\n! the cap should actually be made from something that's UVC resistant as Acrylic will allow for the transmission of harmful UV rays. PTFE is one option and the same material that the teflon tape is made from as is PVC (but you shouldn't vaporize it/laser cut it because it's harmful to your health to breathe and so don't let it into the environment either). A very simple solution would just be to coat it in several layers of white paint containing titanium dioxide which is basically where the pigment comes from. Do this for both the inner and out layer to ensure good protection. Machining this component into rustproof steel like alumnium or die casting may be the best solution in the long run. Remember the UVC is on a non visible spectrum so be practical whenever dealing with UV light.\nMore information and links on the bottom of the page.\nPlace the lock nut inside the UV cap. Use teflon tape or hemp fibre with some mineral oil and place it inside the UV cap.\nPlace the brass union inside while holding in the lock nut.

While many pure plastics cannot absorb UV radiation, the presence of catalyst residues and other impurities will often act as receptors, causing degradation. Only a very small amount of impurity may be needed for the degradation to occur, e.g. trace parts per billion values of sodium in polycarbonate will initiate color instability. In the presence of oxygen the free radicals form oxygen hydroperoxides that can break the double bonds of the backbone chain leading to a brittle structure. This process is often called photo-oxidation. However, in the absence of oxygen there will still be degradation due to the cross-linking process which is the effect for plastics used for the Hubble Space Telescope and International Space Station.\nUnmodified types of plastics that are regarded as having unacceptable resistance to UV are POM (Acetal), PC, ABS and PA6/6. Other plastics such as PET, PP, HDPE, PA12, PA11, PA6, PES, PPO, PBT and PPO are regarded as fair. Note that a PC/ABS alloy is also graded as fair. Good resistance to ultraviolet rays can be achieved from polymers extruded by Zeus such as PTFE, PVDF, FEP, and PEEKTM. The only plastics found with excellent resistance are the imides, Polyimide (PI) as used in the Hubble Space Telescope and Polyetherimide (PEI).\nPTFE has particularly good UV resistance because of its very strong carbon-fluorine (C-F) bond [almost 30% higher than the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond], which is the common side bond that surrounds the carbon (C-C) backbone in a helix and protects it. Most fluoropolymers also do not have the light absorbing chromophore impurities in their structure that can act as an initiator for photo-oxidation.\nOne useful interaction of UV and plastics is with fluorescent whitening agents (FWA). In natural light many polymer products can appear to have a yellow appearance. But by adding a FWA the UV light absorbed is then emitted in the blue region of visible light (400-500nm wavelength), instead of the yellow region. Compared to other additives FWAs only need to be added at small levels, typically 0.01 \u2014 0.05 % by weight.\nHow to Avoid UV Degradation\nThere are several ways of avoiding UV degradation in plastics \u2014 by using stabilizers, absorbers or blockers. For many outdoor applications, the simple addition of carbon black at around a 2% level will provide the protection for the structure by the blocking process. Other pigments such as titanium dioxide can also be effective. Organic compounds such as benzophenones and benzotriazoles are typical absorbers which selectively absorb the UV and re-emit at a less harmful wavelength, mainly as heat. The benzotriazole type is good, as it has a low color and can be used at low dose rates below 0.5%.\nThe other main mechanism for protection is to add a stabilizer, the most common being a HALS (Hindered Amine Light Stabilizer). These absorb the excited groups and prevent the chemical reaction of the radicals.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLD/ATAK/IGTYCPKU/FLDATAKIGTYCPKU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD2/N463/IGTYCPKZ/FD2N463IGTYCPKZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFD/B7TI/IGTYCPN3/FFDB7TIIGTYCPN3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHL/B06B/IGTYCPPH/FHLB06BIGTYCPPH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGI/N551/IGTYCPQN/FGIN551IGTYCPQN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1J/1W53/IGTYCPU4/F1J1W53IGTYCPU4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR7/BMCP/IGTYCPWJ/FR7BMCPIGTYCPWJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWY/6PTD/IGTYCPXG/FWY6PTDIGTYCPXG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUW/O1TZ/IGTYCPZU/FUWO1TZIGTYCPZU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAW/0EWR/IGTYCQ32/FAW0EWRIGTYCQ32.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5V/MMIC/IGTYCQ6H/F5VMMICIGTYCQ6H.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 11: Assemble the UV"}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "So this is the part where I run out of photos. You still need to attach the drain and the pump together. This part will vary depending on the drain. There are three ways to do this: 1) take over the drain pipe with some connectors and attach something similar to the UV cap to connect a large PVC pipe to a thinner hose.\nAttach the drain hose to the pump with female hose connectors. Some pumps come with different types of connectors - with threads or without and sometimes you don't always get what you ordered so you have to spend some time in the plumbing section of the hardware store for this. Ring clamps are your friends.\nNow this part is super essential and obvious component if you want to build Showerloop. It needs to have a 3-way valve by the drain which allows you to either pump the water through the filters or let the water go down the drain - or water storage tank/toilet/etc. So if you can fit it in you can add the three - way valve. Alternatively I made a special basin with two drain plugs whereby one goes into the Showerloop filter and the other one goes into the drain drain. I'm also working on a 2-in-1 solution, which I hope to release in the next Instructable.\nReheating the water: Just use tap water for now, we will add a tutorial on how to use an electrical resistor to heat up the water.\nWire the electricals safely out of the way: This is super important and for sure something that you've already thought about. Basically the pump and UV that I use are all rated to be water proof / water resistant. It's a good idea to house everything in a water proof container. I'm still working on this part and the ones mentioned above and will release a new Instructable showing how I combined it with an existing shower in the coming weeks/months.\nTest the shower:\nThis part is simple. Just turn it on and see if it leaks. This is common for me in the beginning, usually something is just a bit too loose and some monkey wrench action will fix it all up.\nTry out the shower:\nThe first time using it I would maybe have someone on standby to make sure everything is ok. Have it running on it's own for an 10 minutes without 'recycling' to clear the activated carbon and sand of dust (which will happen when you compress it the first time). Then have the system to run on it's own for up to an hour in recycling mode just to watch it do it's thing. After this it should be good enough to try on it's own.\nComing next:\nsolenoid valves, some drain hacks, using a different kind of pump, and adding buttons and and more control.\nI'm hoping to make a living out of developing, building and helping others build Showerloop to fit to their own needs. If you want to support me you can join the R&D group we are setting up, donate to my cause or even buy our Showerloop KIT, more info at Showerloop.org. Also more relevant info is posted on our facebook page facebook.com/showerloop .\nWe are solving some of the bits and pieces mentioned above, but many of them have already been solved. This Instructable is a bit behind on the developments that I've made since POC21 which is why I'll be making a new update very soon. The filters, pump, UV and connections are all the same in our KIT, it simply incorporates some of the solutions mentioned above so I wouldn't discourage anyone from following this Instructable if they feel able to solve the last steps on their own.

It takes around 10 to 15 minutes to dry . One important thing about the chalky paint is that , don't overload the brush with paint. The paint is already heavy and so if you overload the brush it leaves strong brush marks. I read somewhere that dipping the brush in water after loading the paint helps to reduce the brush strokes but that doesn't works in dark colors. I did try that technique which resulted in lighter shade of the black(Carbon) streaks and was spoiling the look. So, take a little amount of paint at a time and work your way.

With indoor production facilities, such as our re-purposed shipping containers, keeping the indoor temperature at a level ideal for plant growth can be a challenge, especially in winter months.\nIn central Ohio, where the hapi project was created, we have 4 distinct seasons. Our winters last from December through February, during which outside air temperatures average around 20\u00b0F with a record low of -28\u00b0F. Sub-zero colds snaps are not uncommon. Some season extension techniques, such as hoop houses and cold frames, can allow for growing cold-weather crops late into the winter. Similarly these technologies can effectively move spring a few weeks sooner. However, a cold snap can quickly stunt winter growing activities for all except heated greenhouses.\nA key goal for all of our products is to evolve urban agriculture technologies along multiple, separate but interrelated axis'. First and foremost of these is energy. While it is certainly feasible to burn fossil fuels to heat a grow container, it goes against our commitment to make food production carbon neutral. Solar thermal is not a new technology. It is often employed to heat water (solar water heaters) and, less commonly/commercially, air. In either case, the units function as follows (example is with air).\nA heat absorber is placed in a box with a transparent top/face. The box has an inlet at its lower end and an outlet at its upper end. When sunlight strikes the absorber, the air that is in contact with it warms. This warm air rises and exits through the outlet. This upward air movement creates a convection current. Cooler air moves into the unit from the inlet. This air is in turn warmed and the process continues while sunlight remains.\nOur needs and constraints are a bit different from most of what we found online. We needed to mount the unit on the end of a corrugated box made of thick steel, with insulation on the inside. The unit is mounted completely vertical and must help us exceed our daily operational needs during the winter, in order to make up for the short days of January.\nTo learn more about this and other projects, visit us at hapihq.com.", "title": "Solar Thermal Air Heater (on a Shipping Container)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Solar-Thermal-Air-Heater-on-a-Shipping-Container/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "We started with a sheet of 11/32\" plywood, standard size 4' x 8'.

I chose to re-purpose the headboard because it was made of solid mahogany. Mahogany is a hardwood that is very rich in color when a clear finish is applied. The vibrant and deep tones of the mahogany contrasted well with the lighter birch veneer on the plywood. You could use any type of wood for this step however I would recommend it be a hardwood as it will stand up better to abuse over time. The dimensions of the trim will vary based on the plywood that you select for this project. The plywood I chose was slightly under 3/4\" thick. I began by cleaning up the faces of the mahogany on the thickness planer. This could also be done with a hand smoothing plane but since I had quite a bit of grime to clean off, the planer was a much more efficient method. Once all my faces were clean and still of sufficient thickness (3/4\"), I then began ripping up both my rails and edging strips. For these cabinets I wanted to add both a top and bottom rail to make a more sophisticated looking unit. The bottom rail was sized at 2\" wide. This provides a nice lift off the floor where they would be installed. For the top rail I went with 1 1/2\" in width. I cross-cut these rails to length on the table saw with a cross-cut sled using as stop block. The outside end panels will get an edge trim on both the front and top edges of the plywood. The top and bottom shelves will get just the front trim applied to the front edge of the plywood. I ripped strips for the edging that were slightly wider than the thickness of the plywood. I cut mine to 7/8\" wide as I would be gluing them onto the plywood and trimming them with a flush trim bit in my router later. If you don't own a router you'll want to go ahead and rip these to a dimension just ever so slightly wider than your plywood is thick and once glued on the edge a few quick passes with a sander and you can have them flush with the surface of the plywood. You'll need to cut a lot of strips for this step depending on the number of units you build. The vertical dividers of the smaller unit will have edging cut to fit in a later step while the tiered units can have it applied sooner. I recommend cutting the trim to longer lengths now, applying to the plywood and cutting panels down to final dimensions later.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDJ/4B5R/IJKA9KK9/FDJ4B5RIJKA9KK9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9H/1JCU/IJKA9KKM/F9H1JCUIJKA9KKM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Cutting Down Your Trim"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Before cross-cutting the panels down to final dimension, you'll want to go ahead and glue the edge strips and rails onto the plywood first. That way, the edging gets cut to final dimension along with the panel at the same time. This can be a tedious part of this project and the number of clamps you have will determine how long this step will take.\nThere are several different techniques that can be utilized when gluing on the edging. I tried a couple methods. One involves gluing a wider strip between two panels and ripping them apart on the table saw. This can be tricky if the panels are larger as in the photo I included. The other method involves gluing a single strip on each individual panel, one at a time. I ended up using this method for the majority of this project and it worked well for me.\nFor the exterior end panels, the top and front edges get an edge trim. For the nicest look, you'll want to miter the front top corners of the edging before gluing them onto the panel. For the smaller units, the center vertical dividers will not get edging glued on just yet because of the top rail. These will get measured and cut to fit after dry-assembly.

You could also cut them on a radial arm saw or sliding compound miter saw if you have enough depth of cut. Because the panels are over 16\" wide with the trim attached I chose the table saw using my cross-cut sled. This method is good for a number of reasons such as zero-clearance cuts providing a clean cut across the trim and with a fine-toothed blade you can get a fairly clean cut on the plywood as well.

Ultimately this is up to you depending on how much slop you want to give yourself. I recommend about 1/8\" more width than the lip as this should be sufficient to prevent binding when sliding the bins in place. The edging was glued on ahead of time so that the dados could be cut through the edging as well. When cutting, be sure to use a sacrificial fence on your miter gauge to prevent blow out on the back side of the dado. If you do not own a dado stack or table saw, you could also use a router with and edge guide to cut the dados. There are bits that are sized for standard and typical plywood thicknesses though this method requires multiple passes to obtain the depth you desire. I cut a 3/8\" deep dado on the outside panels and about 1/4\" on the internal vertical dividers. You may need to adjust these depths depending how tight the fit is. I recommend a test cut or two to determine how deep your dados need to be. If you do not own a router you could also utilize some matching hardwood cleats for the lips of the bins to ride on.

For these two reasons I wanted to utilize a joinery method that would provide added strength so I chose to use dominos. If you're unfamiliar with dominos, they are essentially floating tenons that are similar to biscuits only they extend further into the work pieces and provide a stronger glue joint. Whatever method you choose, be sure to apply a liberal amount of glue to the joint for a strong bond.

Now is also a good time to measure and cut to fit the edges of the two middle vertical dividers on the smaller units.

A less obvious reason for sanding is to prepare the surface to accept your finish. This is particularly important when using a water-based finish like I did.

Any shortcuts taken on either of these steps will mean a less than desirable outcome. I chose to sand with a really fine grit sandpaper (about 400 grit) between coats and I applied a total of three coats to each piece.

Also, the more travel we have in the slide, the longer we can make the mounting plate, so the higher the TV will be when deployed.\nWhy face down? We could also have the TV face up, and have it tilt up when the drawer is fully open, but that would mean that we couldn't close the drawer when the TV was deployed.\nSo we have to be careful when we choose our drawer slides, and when we choose the dimension of the drawer. My TV is only 12.75\" tall, but I chose slides with 22\" of travel to allow it to hinge upwards while still being high enough.\nI looked at a lot of other support hardware before deciding on the spring supports: locking cabinet hinges, folding lid supports, sliding lid supports, and gas springs.\nI wanted to use gas springs, but after some trial and error, I decided against it. They are the most suitable hardware for that purpose, but I just couldn't make them fit in the space I had allocated. And they are more expensive. Instead I used some chest lid supports that use a wire spring. These come in three levels for different weights, and were easy to install.\nAbout my approach\nWith the general idea in mind, I mostly figured out the details as I went along. I didn't make a sketch with everything in it, and I didn't know every dimension starting out - most things were measured \"in place\", and locations transferred directly from the hardware being used. If you want to use a CNC service to produce the mounting plate, you will have to plan ahead more than I did.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQH/J73W/IJKAD21B/FQHJ73WIJKAD21B.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: About the Design"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I already had a small Samsung HDTV, measuring 21.5\" diagonally.

I say 'event' as it tends to happen mostly in the month of May in the UK. Last year, 2015, we caught 9 such swarms and increased our own hive number from 5 to 12. Many of the swarms came from one or two of our own hives that we had dedicated to the actual production of natural swarms.\nThe boxes needed to actually catch swarms are quite different in design to normal hives and need to be lightweight and easily secured for transportation. Plywood is the ideal material to use. Quite often, these boxes need to be moved to another site 3 miles away or more and it's absolutely vital that the bees don't escape into the car. The boxes are also used for creating an artificial 'Nucleus' colony.\nDuring the peak of the swarm season I will check the hedgerows for swarms maybe four times a day. Once, I was working out in a field and I could hear a swarm approaching - it passed by overhead, went past the neighbour's open bathroom window and 'landed' on the branch of a small apple tree, with me running in hot pursuit! Another time I was approaching the apiary and a swarm of bees was congregating above it. Once the correct bees were out of the hive, they all set off at high speed across the fields and out of sight to cluster again in a more remote location.\nAllowing some our bees to swarm and trying to catch them again is one of the most natural ways of 'Making increase', or in other words, increasing the number of colonies in the apiary. Another way is to sub divide by with an artificial split and create what is called a 'Nucleus' which is basically frames taken from another colony with an abundance of healthy brood, eggs, stores and actual bees, except the queen. A new queen will be produced by the nurse worker bees from eggs on the frames. The natural swarm is however better and the bees have an amazing knack for selecting exactly the right number of foraging bees, nurse bees, drones and queens to go with them on their intrepid flight into the unknown.\nThis is a perfect project for the dark Winter months and whatever we want to do - an artificial split or collect natural swarms - these boxes are the business!", "title": "Plywood Honey Bee Swarm Bait Catch Hive and Nucleus Box - Dual Purpose How to DIY Plans", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Plywood-Honey-Bee-Swarm-Bait-Catch-Hive-and-Nucleu/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "There is only one thing for sure about beekeeping - no two beekeepers will ever agree on any one thing. There's an old saying: \"Ask two beekeepers the same question and you'll get three different answers\".\nThere is always a lot of debate about which materials are suitable for making bee hives, nucleus boxes and catch hives. Some long respected professional beekeepers in my local beekeeping association have been quite happily using plywood painted with oil based paints for decades, although they do prefer western red cedar given the choice. I build all our own plywood boxes in the Winter, which gives a good 4 months for the paint to dry and any residual fumes to be completely gone. One of our most productive colonies is housed in a big plywood box painted with an oil based paint and is now designated as our main producer of swarms.\nThe great thing about plywood is that it is cheap and easy to work with and, due to it's inherent strength, hives can be made out of very thin sections, using much less weight of wood. A strong hive can be made with 5mm plywood compared with 16mm western red cedar, which is the 'traditional' material. The important thing with plywood is to protect it from the rain, either with really good paint or even polythene film or sheet. 5mm plywood does, however, have poor insulation properties so all our hives are protected with 'Bee Cosies' during the Winter, which also protect them against the rain.\nAt the end of the day, especially with catch hives, if the bees don't like it, they won't choose it as a home.\nAnother thing that would be really great is if all the parts could be laser cut and some engraving burnt out on the side panels. Oh for a laser cutter, or someone who has got one big enough in the UK? Actually, the H-Series 20x12 laser cutter would be perfect for this job - just the right size.

Here, we have the original strain of the British black bee which dates back hundreds, if not thousands of years into history. Since then, the rest of Britain and the world at large has been infiltrated by Italian bees and other sub species and for a long time it was thought that the native British bee was lost altogether into the dark hole of extinction.\nSince the island is actually in Wales, the bees here have been renamed the 'Welsh Black Bee' and given their own latin name: Apis melifera melifera, which, in the scientific world, is a bit like being given a knighthood by the queen.\nAlso, in some part due to the 'effectiveness' of our local beekeeping association, we have very little disease here as beekeepers are strongly dissuaded from bringing bees to the island from the Outside. All in all, it's a perfect place for breeding bees and protecting and proliferating the native species.\nApart from the emotional reasons, why should we protect these bees? There are a number of very good reasons, including:\nThe bees are 'locally adapted', which, in genetic terms, means they are adapted to the climate. For example, it rains here quite a lot and these bees can fly in the rain!\nBees and other pollinators are, in general, under threat from the increasingly cheap and powerful insecticides being used.

In technical beekeeper's language this is called 'Bee-space'.\nWhen the box is built, the frames sit on a solid looking ledge, as seen in the photo above. It is important not to leave this feature out as it stops the bees from expanding their comb construction towards the two ends of the box. Just resting the frames on wooden lugs will result in disaster as the frames will then be stuck in place. We need to be able to remove the frames so that they can be relocated in bigger hives at a later stage.\nThe 'solid' ledge is actually hollow and so a piece of plastic tube is inserted into the hole to prevent bees from entering the hollow space. Do not leave out this feature, as the queen, and other bees, might hide in there and be lost to the beekeeper.\nIt is important that the boxes have 'feet' as this stops them from getting wet and mouldy when positioned on their stands later in the year.\nThe boxes have what are called 'Open Mesh Floors' which provide ventilation and help reduce infestations of varroa mites.

Instead, seeds that had been in the soil I used started to grow (see picture 2). This set me back some time, as I had to remove these bad herbs and plant new seeds. This time I made furrows and planted 2-3 seeds at the same place, and then spread out the seeds in lines in the soil. As you can see from picture 3 this gave the result I wanted.

When testing the pump later I found that the flow of water was around 1 liter / minute, while the specifications of the pump say it can pump 7,5 liter / minute. This means that I can get choose how much water I want to get out of the pump by adjusting the time of the timer.\nTo make it easy to refill the container with water and also attach the pump to the container I cut out an opening on top of the container just big enough to fit my hand through it (picture 2 and 3).

I then found that the Sugru makes for a good flat surface on the pump that keeps it better in place against the container side.\nI chose to use zip ties to attach the pump, with the zip ties attached permanently to the container but not the pump. In this way the pump can be removed for servicing or replacement if it should fail in the future. While holding the pump in place I made some marks to remember where to place the zip ties. I cut out some holes just big enough for the zip ties and fed them through the holes. I glued one end of the zip ties against the container side with a hot melt glue gun, then put the water pump inside the container and tightened the zip ties with the other end.

The reason for that was that I had not taken into consideration the siphon effect. When the water tank was filled with water and standing on the floor next to the garden boxes the water would flow through the tube into the garden box by itself until the water in the tank and garden box had the same level. This happened outside of the programmed watering time, but luckily I only had 2-3 liters of water in the tank otherwise the garden box would have overflowed onto the floor. So I realised the garden boxes had to be higher than the water tank to avoid this effect.\nSo for this I built a simple bench using one 4,5 x 2,5 cm piece of pinewood. I tried to keep it simple so I only used this plank of wood for the whole bench. I don't have more instructions for this bench than the photos, but it should be relatively simple to make. I first glued and screwed together the frame using four pieces of wood, then added the legs and finally the angled reinforcement pieces. This bench also has the added benefits of simplifying cleaning around the garden boxes, getting a better work height and it gets the garden boxes up to window height.

We opted for a polycarbonate greenhouse, as it was easy to assemble, UV treated, and economical. Add to this we live in a very high wind area, and we have dogs.... so we were worried how a glass one would fair up.\nOnce assembled, build your garden beds. We opted for slightly raised beds, so that we could really improve the soil on what used to be a wasteful piece of lawn. Fill your beds with compost and dig it all through with the soil. If your soil is too tight, add a wee bit of sand. I also threw in water retaining granules just to help with watering in my new zone... but with a good watering, this isn't really necessary.\nYou will also need a thermometer. When our greenhouse reaches 35 degrees celcius, the doors get opened as everything inside gets too warm.\nWe put in a stone path to help warm the greenhouse, and maintain warmth overnight.\nWe put in a seed raising table, on which we grow plants from seeds.... on the table. This is aluminum so it will not rust.\nThe latest addition (not pictured as it is ugly) is a 40 litre bright pink bucket of water. As the greenhouse warms up, the water starts to evaporate, and the air remains a nice humidity for the plants (though somewhat hellish for me).", "title": "Inground Greenhouse Growing (including Recipes)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Inground-Greenhouse-Growing-including-Recipes/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Know first of all where your sun comes from, and what grows well there....\nWe have one side that gets sun in the morning, and during lunch. The other side gets the evening sun. On the morning sun side we grow tomatoes as they love it. The cucumbers prefer the longer light rather than the heat, so they grow on the other side.\nThe tomatoes all have cages, which I use a gardeners best friend to support the toms. ZIP-TIES! Keep a supply handy for training your tomatoes and holding them safely to the stakes. Do not tighten these all the way.\nThe cucumbers grow long and straight when they can grow vertically. Hang a strip of plastic trellis from the roof.... attached to the frames with ZIP TIES! I seriously use these for everything. The cucumbers may need encouragement to grow, so carefully zip tie the vines to the trellis. Soon you will have tomatoes and cucumbers reaching the ceiling of your greenhouse. NOT EVEN KIDDING.\nDo remember that your greenhouse needs extra work. Growing inground means you do need to do weeding, so you don't get to miss this. You will also want to do this in the morning, or you will be gardening in a sauna. You also need to add fertiliser and compost more frequently than in the regular garden. We use an organic compost at the start of every season, and a liquid fertilizer every 4 or so weeks during the growing season to keep up nutrient levels. Our local garden centre does free soil testing, so we do this to see what we need to do. We also have chickens who love to provide extra manure... and the other bonus.... chickens as tractors.... at the end of the season my 2 chooks will clear and dig over the garden in the greenhouse in a few hours, removing all greenery, weeds, seeds, and dig the tough soil. Total gems.

Here is my awesome recipe for a sauce that can be used so many ways (saving on meal prep and everything). This recipe is best scaled for how many tomatoes you have.... it can be bottled for use later, or refrigerated for use for the following week.\nFirst, de-skin the tomatoes. Do this by cutting a wee X in the bottom of each one. Submerge in boiling water until the skin starts to split. Drop them into a bowl of ice water. The skins now are easy to remove (and will be happily eaten by those awesome chooks.... the beagles don't have as many functions).\nSauce:\n- Skinless tomatoes (for each 5-6 reasonable sized toms)\n- sliced onion\n- handful of chopped basil\n- dried oregano\n- salt\n- pepper\nSweat your onions in a little olive oil. When they are clear, add your tomatoes. You can chop these roughly. When they start to soften, season with the oregano, salt and pepper.\nThrow in your basil leaves, and then blitz with a stick blender until smooth-ish. You do want some chunky bits (or no-one knows its homemade).\nTo use as a pizza sauce:\nMARGARITA PIZZA\nMix up your pizza dough.\nRoll out the dough for the pizza and heat on a pizza stone in the oven\nWhen slightly risen and browned, add the sauce. Cook for 5 minutes.\nAdd the cheese.\nWhen cheese is gloriously melted, remove from the heat and sprinkle basil leaves.\nSlice and enjoy. Star Trek pizza cutter optional.\nAs a pasta sauce:\nSPAGHETTI\nCook spaghetti\nStir through hot sauce\nGrate Parmesan cheese on top. DONE. Decorate with basil leaves if trying to impress. Remember to state you grew the sauce yourself. Smugness is optional.\nOR\nCook pasta. Cover with meatballs. Pour sauce on top. Grate Parmesan cheese on top.\nPerfect as a take to work lunch.\n\nIn a pull-apart pie\nSpread a circle of puff pastry with sauce and a little grated cheese.\nCover with another circle of pastry.\nPlace a glass in the centre.\nCut lines out from the edge of the glass to the edge of the pastry in segments like pizza (attached in the middle)\nTwist each segment twice in the same direction, and attach down to the cooking sheet.\nBake for 30 minutes at 180 degrees Celsius (or until pastry is cooked)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FM4/XKBV/IJIZ4U4B/FM4XKBVIJIZ4U4B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOK/4L6U/IJIZ4U4D/FOK4L6UIJIZ4U4D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F25/66G6/IJIZ4U5T/F2566G6IJIZ4U5T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE8/E6DV/IJIZ4U89/FE8E6DVIJIZ4U89.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5N/NEA2/IJIZ4U9N/F5NNEA2IJIZ4U9N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F35/HP08/IJIZ4UA4/F35HP08IJIZ4UA4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7H/UF3R/IJIZ4UE3/F7HUF3RIJIZ4UE3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHB/7ACZ/IJIZ4UF4/FHB7ACZIJIZ4UF4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6H/F5XB/IJIZ4UE6/F6HF5XBIJIZ4UE6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL4/BC73/IJIZ4UFL/FL4BC73IJIZ4UFL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0U/1S8E/IJIZ4UFM/F0U1S8EIJIZ4UFM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3J/B710/IJIZ4UGK/F3JB710IJIZ4UGK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZV/N8HR/IJIZ4UGR/FZVN8HRIJIZ4UGR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFY/09D8/IJIZ4UIN/FFY09D8IJIZ4UIN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHR/9YS3/IJIZ4UJ5/FHR9YS3IJIZ4UJ5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUM/LQ2O/IJIZ4UJO/FUMLQ2OIJIZ4UJO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCN/C7M1/IJIZ4UK6/FCNC7M1IJIZ4UK6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO8/SEU7/IJIZ4UL6/FO8SEU7IJIZ4UL6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F24/BCTJ/IJIZ4UMC/F24BCTJIJIZ4UMC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Dealing With All That Extra Growth -

So I decided to have a go at designing my own, the instructions for which follow. It will take some work, gathering materials, putting it together. And I estimate will cost around \u00a350.

Try www.lamps&lights.co.uk for electrical items. The books came from a local book shop - selecting books on a subject that's of particular interest will add another twist, personalising the finished product. I found the oak dowel at www.railwaysleeper.co.uk. The base and finishing piece to go on the dowel can be sourced from any decent timber merchant who should offer a service to cut to size and shape sides of the base as you wish. Alternatively you can do it yourself. Stain the oak (wood) in the desired colour....my preference would be for a darker stain as shown in the photo to give an antique ambience.\nWhile using the instructions which follow, study the design illustration at Step 2.\nInstructions\n1. In the book that will be positioned at the bottom of the pile of books and stuck to the base, cut a 2 cms channel for the lamp wire as shown in the attached illustration. This will allow the lamp wire to exit at the bottom of the pile of the books once the dowel has been secured into the pile of books.\n2. Gather the books and position them to one end of the base. Mark on the base where the bottom book is to be positioned.\n3. Glue the covers of all the books together to form a single object. Allow to dry.\n4. Once the books are solid and secure, replace onto base and mark on the top book where the oak dowel is to be positioned.\n5. Cut a 2 cms hole in the books - into which the dowel and wire will sit. Repositioning the books onto the base to mark the hole.\n6. Decide on the height of lamp and cut dowel accordingly. I' recommend 30 cms but certainly no more than 40 cms for safety purposes. Then screw the hook brace to the top section of the dowel, and glue the wooden finishing piece to the top of dowel.\n7. Using the marked hole on the base, secure the oak dowel to the base screwing the two brace brackets on opposite sides of the dowel and onto the base so that the dowel ends up in a vertical and right-angled position to the base.\n8. Attach the lamp wire to the hook and dowel by wrapping it around the hook and dowel. Leave around 15 cms of wire at the hook end so that the lamp base can be attached. The remaining wire will be for attaching the on/off switch and plug, so don't cut the wire until you know where the final table lamp is to be positioned interrelation to wall plug socket.\n9. Position the hole in the books over the dowel pushing the books to the base, covering the brace brackets, and glue. Remember that the book with the wire exit channel needs to be at the bottom of the pile of books and glued to base, with the channel positioned at the back.\n10. Cut the wire at the end of the hook to required hanging length for Edison bulb and then attach lamp base to wire. I'd suggest the bulb hangs at least 15 cms above the base and clear of the books by a similar distance.\n11. Attach the on/off switch to the wire about 30 cms from where it exits the books. Then finally add the plug to the end of the wire for connection.

Why you ask, well maybe you read my Floss Window instructable, there is one reason to refill your floss dispenser. Here is another; place more floss in a smaller container, great for traveling or downsizing. This instructable will display the different floss dispensers I had on hand.\nYou may prefer one floss over another, on the other hand you may not. There are many different brands and size containers of floss. Floss comes in different lengths, I have seen from 4 yards up to 122 yards. So would it be cool to refill a 4 yard \"sample\" size floss dispenser with a 55 yard refill? Whoa say what? That is right, I placed a 55 yard floss spool into a 4 yard \"sample\" size dispenser with room to spare. That is a 1,275% increase without making any other changes.\nWhen you add a Floss Window to your refillable floss dispenser you will have a dynamic dual. More floss in a smaller space and know when the dispenser is low before you run out. Read on for more information about floss dispenser sizes.\nSome benefits of this project are:\n1. Better utilization of existing space by placing more floss into a smaller space.\n2. No space is too small to go unnoticed.\n3. By placing more floss into a smaller space you are free to take more floss when you are traveling or bugging out (\u201cwhere space is at a premium\u201d).\n4.

Spruce trees like many other pine trees, needs a forest fire to spread their seeds most of the time.\nThey start to produce cones when they are quite tall, 15 to 20 feet tall, the cone starts off small and green in the spring and grow during the summer turning brown in the fall. The mature cones look much like the skin of an Armadillo. The cones protect the seeds from birds and stay on the tree for a couple years until they open and fall off the tree or a forest fire opens them.\nIn a forest fire the heat from the fire causes the cone to open and after the fire passes the seeds fall to the ground replanting the forest to grow until the next forest fire.

More means your muscles are disappearing along with your fat.\n\n\nWhat to eat\n\nHere, I would like to take the opportunity to tell you, that if you improve your food selection, your results will be much faster and your health and energy levels much better!\n\nWhat not to eat\n\nImprove your food selection, by eliminating all sugars and products containing refined sugar and by reducing salt.\n\nSugar:\n\nis a highly addictive product, sadly as addictive as nicotine and it is high in unnecessary calories that will slow down your progress.\n\nSalt:\n\nReduce Salt in your food.the maximum recommended salt intake is 5 grams (1 teaspoon) per day.. when you consume more, it poisons your body, and the body starts to retain water to reduce the salt density in it in order to prevent itself from being poisonned.\n\nAllergies and sensitivities\n\nMany people including myself, are allergic to diary, and/or Gluten ( a protein found in grains such a wheat ).\n\nIf you get bloated after you consume bread, then you are sensitive to gluten. you will feel much better if you replace it with corn bread for example.\n\nIf you get gas after you consume diary, well you are sensitive to that too..Milk can be replaced with almond milk for example.\n\nWhat to eat\n\nTry to eat whole foods, meaning buy whole ingredients that aren't tampered with nor manufactured from the super market such as a steak, a potato , a fruit , a vegetable etc..\n\nFor more info on this topic, please google Paleo diet food list.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCE/E5A6/IJD9EZLK/FCEE5A6IJD9EZLK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F68/Y03P/IJD9EZLH/F68Y03PIJD9EZLH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSN/9V4R/IJD9EZEV/FSN9V4RIJD9EZEV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPJ/4GOH/IJD9EZEW/FPJ4GOHIJD9EZEW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDT/7X5K/IJD9EZEX/FDT7X5KIJD9EZEX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGP/7NFW/IJD9EZF0/FGP7NFWIJD9EZF0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5X/8KDK/IJD9EZF8/F5X8KDKIJD9EZF8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDS/C85X/IJD9EZF9/FDSC85XIJD9EZF9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMF/CZTP/IJD9EZFE/FMFCZTPIJD9EZFE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVD/N31M/IJD9EZFH/FVDN31MIJD9EZFH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1W/0LMN/IJD9EZFN/F1W0LMNIJD9EZFN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIP/7V31/IJD9EZFT/FIP7V31IJD9EZFT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN4/CIEL/IJD9EZHH/FN4CIELIJD9EZHH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: The Nutrition"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Many intermittent fasters started to see results within 2 weeks..\n\nYOU WILL TOO.\n\nThis lifestyle is very forgiving, do not worry too much about your food selection , but do not exaggerate it either.\n\nWith 2-3 kg (4.5-6.5 pounds) of loss per month, you will lose between 12-18 kilos (26-40 pounds) in a period of 6 month!\n\nThat's an excellent result.\n\nI highly recommend you to do some sport that will involve all your muscles in a one week period like going to the gym for example and taking it easy there, as this will pass the message to your body that your muscles are very dear to you, and that at no circumstances it should use them for energy.\n\nOne important note here\n\nThe result you are actually searching for is not to lose weight..\n\nIt is to lose weight and maintain the new weight as is for years to come..This is what most diets fail to achieve, as people go off their diet after they have reached their goal, only to see their weight go back up after a few month, to where it first was..\n\nBy losing 2-3 kg (4.5-6.5 pounds) per month, you are also adapting your Thyroid gland to your new weight, thus preventing it from taking it back up.\n\nThis gland controls the body weight, when you lose weight really fast, it \"thinks\" that your body is in an environment where there is a lack of food, as a defense mechanism, it slows down your metabolism speed to bring your weight back up, and insure your survival by stocking more fat..", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQD/0W5G/IJD9F1JJ/FQD0W5GIJD9F1JJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: The Results"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "You're fasting, and you love it, but tonight your friends invited you to a night out in a bar and a restaurant.\n\nYou know you 're gonna have to eat and drink there, but you're not that happy about it because you'll be overeating, and that will slow down your weight loss results.. what do you do? here's the answer.\n\nwhen you are \"forced\" to eat for social reasons, you can get \" picky\" in what you are eating there.\n\nApply a strict but smooth food selection protocol by selecting dishes and snacks with high protein and low carbs in them, and by \"not finishing your dish\" and avoiding small bites and snacks if you can.\n\nLoad up on water.\n\nSubstitute alcoholic drinks with ones that have no \"fillers\", by that I mean selecting strong alcohols (40%), like drinking a neat whisky instead of a beer, this way you wont need to drink all the calories in the beer that gets you fat instead of drunk, after all, we drink alcohol for the alcohol effect, not the other stuff that comes in it.\n\nAfter the night out, i usually pull a 24 hour fast to regulate my calorie intake of the night before, that does the job.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the calorie intake for this case :\n\nnight before : 3500 calories IN from alcohol and snacks.\n\nThe day after : a 24 hour fast , then a 600 calorie high protein meal.\n\nResult : 3500+600 = 4100 calories in 2 days, /2 = 2100 calories a day.\n\nThat's a bit under an average man's daily maintenance calorie intake.\n\nSo in a way, you still can party and lose weight.\n\nRemember:\n\nWith alcohol intake, even though the numbers I mentioned are correct in theory, In reality, your body will retain water for a couple of days after the fact, to treat all the alcohol you took in, so on the weight scale, you might go up around 3-4 pounds, but those will go away after 4-5 days, as the body will dump them after the alcohol is fully digested.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F97/O13I/IJNM5JKP/F97O13IIJNM5JKP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Troubleshooting"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "I haven't invented anything i wrote in this instructable,it is all true and verified through scientific research.

This means I am less likely to cut myself removing the small chucks that are still in the metal frame.

So take your time on this step and think about wearing gloves.\nTo remove the glass, I used a small screwdriver in the channel and chiseled away at the glass chucks.

I found that the small 5\" zip ties fit inside the channel and with a little copper wire, I could create a loop for the zip tie weave. I will call this the hook and loop, cause. . . well why not.\n- Begin by cutting off the head and the tail of an 5\" zip tie. This leaves only an even width chuck of plastic flat on one side and ratcheted on the other, that fits inside the metal channel. I used 6 of these total to wrap all the way inside the metal channel of my lid. Each lid will probably be a little different.\n- I also, cut one extra to help wrap the copper wire and leave enough room for the jump rings to fit.\n- Take two of the zip ties that you just cut and place smooth sides together. Wrap the copper wire around the zip ties as shown in the pictures, don't pull this tight, you don't want to be binding the zip ties together. I had no science to the number of wire wraps per zip tie, or how close they should be placed. I went with a gut feeling of about a 3mm to 6mm apart. The jump rings were 7mm wide and I wanted to have 2 loops of the wire to hold each jump ring. This seems to work well.\n-As you come to the end of the first zip tie pull on the top piece of the zip tie sandwich leaving the metal wire and one zip tie behind, do not remove this second zip tie, it will help you continue your looping, only pull it about half way. You should now have a single zip tie with a loosely wrapped wire and room to add another piece of cut zip tie. You can see this in the pictures attached. I used a black and a white zip tie so they are easier to see.\nIf you were not already aware, there is a smooth side of a zip tie and a ratchet side. If you place the 2 ratchet sides together during the steps above, you will not be able to slide one piece forward and you will get frustrated, very frustrated. . . . Start over.\n- You will now need to start pressing the single wire wrapped zip tie into the metal channel. I used a small flat head screw driver to help position the zip tie and push it into the channel. Press about half the length of the zip tie into the channel, then start wrapping the second cut zip tie with wire.\n-After the second tie is wrapped about halfway, push the first zip tie all the way into the channel and the start of the second tie. The trick here is that you want to keep the zip ties butted up against each other in the channel, so it is like one long gasket. And you want to keep the wire wrapped so it isn't too loose. Continue until you have wrapped this all the way around and the channel is now full.\nYour Hook and loop is now created and installed into the metal frame!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOS/0JIH/IJBTXOWL/FOS0JIHIJBTXOWL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3K/CNVL/IJBTXOWK/F3KCNVLIJBTXOWK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMT/XCD2/IJBTXOWP/FMTXCD2IJBTXOWP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHK/2OQ6/IJBTXOWN/FHK2OQ6IJBTXOWN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9D/6D94/IJBTXOWY/F9D6D94IJBTXOWY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOY/VDAZ/IJBTXOX0/FOYVDAZIJBTXOX0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Creating a Hook and Loop Inside the Channel."}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "With the Hook and loop in place I decided to place jump rings on the loops so the zip ties would lay flat. This way, ideally the zip ties would attach to the jump rings and create a pretty flat weave.\nOne thing I learned, use thicker jump rings. The ones I used I found at Joann Fabrics and they work, but they are thin metal and easy to bend, thus in later steps when you are creating the zip tie weave, they flex and can come off the wire. This was very frustrating. Using a stronger square jump ring, would have allowed me to pull on the zip tie without constantly flexing the jump rings.\n- Using a set of needle nosed pliers I opened a jump ring, placed it on two wire loops from the hook and loops we just made and tightened the jump ring back to square.\nSince I didn't pay a lot of attention to the distance on the wire when I created the wire loops and pushed the 5\" zip ties into the frame, each loop is at a distance of its own choosing. I tried to always have at least two loops per jump ring. This way they would assist the zip tie in being flat. Some jump rings were actually attached to 3 loops, others only 1. Just depended on where the spacing was.\nMake sure in the end that you used an even number of jump rings. After all each zip tie needs two points of contact, so two jump rings each, preferably right across from each other, but hey that depends on how picky you are during the building of the hook and loop. Since there were 50 jump rings in a bag I used a complete bag, then counted out a few at a time of the second bag, I used a total of 60 jump rings.

This simple step will help resolve many head aches.\nMake sure to keep the jump rings out of the glue or move them around as the glue dries so they are loose and pliable. Work around the entire channel and glue any spaces where two zip ties connect. In my case I used 6 zip ties, so I had 6 connections to glue.\nNow impatiently wait for glue to dry.

Depending on what design you are going for, you may want to start somewhere else. Take a little string and play with ideas on how you want yours to look, then when you have a plan, start using zip ties.\nHere is how my plan played out:\n- Starting on what looked to be the middle of one side of the longest edge I inserted an 8\" zip tie down through the square jump ring and pulled it through, all the way to the ratchet head.\n- Then I needed to count around the jump rings, to the half way point on the other side. In this case I used 60 jump rings, so half way was 30. I inserted the other end of the same zip tie up into the 30th jump ring. Now the zip tie spans the whole distance. And the ratchet head and open end both face up through the square jump rings.\n- Taking a second 8\" zip tie, connect it to the mounted zip tie, on top of the frame. Don't pull very tight yet, you can work on the shape of the lid in a few, start by just getting a few zip ties mounted.\nA simple note, remember this is a lid, and that the lid must sit on the crock pot, thus these zip tie ratchet heads, must all be on 1 side of the lid (the top side). A the metal ring should rest on the crock pot when you put on the lid. I didn't think about this until after that fact on my lid.\n- Next inserted a zip tie down through the jump ring to left of the one you just attached to the frame, staying vertical on the first zip tie. Insert the end of the zip tie up into the jump ring to the left of the one already mounted. Creating a second vertical line.\n- Attach the second zip tie to the mounted zip tie, on top of the frame that you just pulled through.\n- Now go one zip tie to the right of the first one you attached and install the next vertical line.\n- Continue going one zip tie to the left and then right, until you have completed vertical zip tie lines all the way across the longest side of the lid. There will be a point when the curve is too tight to get the zip ties to lay flat. In my case I found that the smaller 5\" zip ties were long enough to span the distance, and since they are not as wide, I could fit them on the edges. Thus I have 2 lines of the thinner 5\" zip ties on each sides.\n- After the vertical lines have been installed you can tighten the zip ties. Keeping in mind that this is a lid, I let the center of the lid be slightly taller and it curved down as it went out. The bottom lays flat.\nYou should now have something that resembles Shredders mask from Teenage Mutation Ninja Turtles, Well maybe not, but it does look weird.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6V/4GZ7/IJBTXOZG/F6V4GZ7IJBTXOZG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF2/B4ID/IJBTXOZH/FF2B4IDIJBTXOZH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Vertical Zip Tie Lines"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Now for the horizontal lines. Since my lid is not large I don't have many horizontal lines, In fact I could only fit 5.\n- Using a long 11\" zip tie, find the center of the unused square jump rings. I had 13 squares on each side, so center was 7.\n- Insert a long zip tie down through the center square jump ring (my #7) and pulled it partially through.\n- Now weave the end of the zip tie over the first vertical zip tie, and under the next. Continue the up and down weaving through all the zip ties all the way across the lid.\n- When you reach the end, make sure to pull the zip tie up through the square jump ring. Remember that the zip tie ratchet heads, must all be on 1 side of the lid (the top side). Otherwise you lid won't work very well.\n- I chose to weave all the top zip ties before connecting the base zip ties this time. Just so it would be easier to move things as I weaved each zip tie. So, insert the next a long zip tie down through the jump ring to the left of the newly weaved horizontal zip tie. Weave the opposite directions that you did for the last one. Under the first vertical zip tie, and over the next. Continue the up and down weaving through all the vertical zip ties all the way across the lid.\n- When you reach the end, make sure to pull the new horizontal zip tie up through the square jump ring.\n- Continue this process of weaving all the horizontal zip ties until you can no longer weave. There may be a few unused square jump rings, depending on space. I ran out of flexable movement after a few horizontal lines.\n- For the bottom of my lid, I didn't weave the long zip tie, I just pulled it straight through the middle and attached the bottom zip tie to the top.\n- Pull the long zip ties tight enough to keep your shape and secure your design.\nYou should now have something that resembles a weaved Shredder Mask with zip tie tails pointing our in all directions.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8G/IAIB/IJBTXOZJ/F8GIAIBIJBTXOZJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Zip Tie Weave"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "The next step is to cut all the zip tie tails.

You could either paint it, plaster it or use matching wood. I plastered mine.\n- Where do you want the locking system so that it doesn't interfere with the functionality of the drawer? Keep it away from magnetic materials that could effect its motion or devices that could get damaged.\n- Where do you want your railings or sliding mechanism? Usually they are placed on the sides but I decided to attach them to the top. This is because I will not be storing heavy items.

AND a pricey look \u201con the cheap\u201d.\nSo, the task was to increase the length of the thermal panels and add details that would satisfy my snooty \u201ccustom look\u201d requirement.\nInserting a \"band\" of fabric (see what I did there...that's why they're called \"banded window treatments\") onto inexpensive readymade drapes would satisfy two of those backstory goals, and ultimately warm up the bedroom.

I needed a 40 inch wide section, plus one inch per side for side hems, SO\u2026I needed about a 42-inch width of fabric.\nHowever\u2026I chose that width (or selection) by finding the preferred center of the print repeat and measuring out 21 inches on each side to determine the section I will use.\nTHEN, I needed a second piece of fabric with that same selection so that the second panel will match.\nSo, a custom look isn\u2019t usually the most economical use of fabric.

My readymade panels were 84\u201d long.\nI cut the panel 1.5\u201d below the header across the full width, leaving me with a 5.5\u201d piece as the top. (See illustration).\nI knew my insert panel would be 28 inches deep, plus .5\u201d at the top and bottom for seam allowances, so I cut a selection 29 inches long (and about 42 inches wide).\nOf course adding fabric gave me too much length, so I cut away 17 additional inches across the readymade panel, leaving me with a 5.5 inch header + 61.5\u201d remaining inches of the readymade panel, to which I would add/insert the 29 inches of the insert fabric. Subtract the two inches for seam allowances and I should end up with 94\u201d panels. (See illustration.)\nNovice tip:\nWhen you sew two pieces of fabric together, you use something called a \u201cseam allowance.\u201d That\u2019s the distance from the cut edge of the fabric to the stitching line (the seam). Most sewing patterns use a 5/8\u201d seam allowance, but I use 1/2\u201d for simpler math.\nYou need to remember to include the seam allowance in the math above, adding a half inch to each place you will join fabric: For the ready made, I added a half inch at the header and a half inch added to the 61\u201d on the bottom. I also added a full inch to the insert piece. That\u2019s why there is an extra two inches when you total the measurements above.

Just place the lining (right side up) on top of the wrong side of the insert fabric before you sew it (i.e., wrong sides together). Then topstitch a quarter inch from the seam over the seam allowance.\nBut, since I was making up the process as I went, I did it this way, which admittedly was the hard way:\nI placed my lining, right side up, on top of the back of the insert (wrong sides together).

Since I don't have a table saw, the only power tool in the house is a cordless drill/screwdriver combo, I was looking in my garage for another solution. When I saw my box full of old t-shirts of different events I attended I had an idea. Why not make a sort of bag that hangs in a corner of the table?\nThe first method I could find was this awesome Instructable of SewMargaretSew. A bit of googling later I even found a method that didn't require a sewing machine, posted here by MommyPotamus. So the credit for the knotting technique goes to her. If the instructions below are a bit to brief for the knotting, I suggest the long instructions on her website. Anyhow, here is how to make the storage bag:\nTurn the T-shirt inside out.\nCut away the sleeves. Be sure to stay outside the seam, because this seam gives the edge some strength.\nMark and cut the top hole. The opening for a head is a bit to small for our application. I used a large plate for that. In the front I made this hole a bit bigger. This will make it easier to grab the stuff that is in the bag when it is mounted to the table.\nOn the bottom of the T-shirt, cut fringes that are about 1cm wide and 5 cm deep. Making them longer will make the knotting easier, but will reduce the amount of stuff you can ditch in the bag later.

The vibration now feels about like riding a street bike on asphalt.\nI wanted to see if the felt vibration could be further reduced. The fixed connecting points looked like logical places to start to isolate the vibration. Replacing the compression adjustment knob with a spring loaded assembly seemed to be the easiest approach.\nThe spring loaded vibration reduction works, however, within limitations. Vibration has a frequency or frequencies. Changing the compression on the spring can damp a frequency. However, changing speed changes the frequency of the vibration. The compression setting will lose effectiveness with the speed change. The damper needs to be tuned to the riding speed. A light compression where the roller just connects with the flywheel to assure reliable rotation seems to be the best setting for a cadence of 70.\nIn version 2.0, I wanted see if there was an easy way to raise the roller off of the flywheel to prevent creating flat spots. I tried a spring under the unit to provide the lift. While the roller rests lightly on the flywheel, the spring does not overcome the mass of the flywheel. Trying to find the balance of two springs to get the lift and and the vibration reduction wasn\u2019t appealing. The configuration was changed back to the single spring version 1.0 but retained the lower lock nut of version 2.0.\nThe lower lock nut was retained so that the unit could be lifted manually and rested on a slotted insert slipped over the bolt above the nut. This keeps the roller off of the flywheel when not in use and may prevent flat spots..\nNote: Many of the photos are of version 2.0.

Most manufactures are including alloy rims in newer model cars as opposed to steel rims with hub caps. This is an easy way to make a vehicle look more valuable, although it begins to fail when people allow their rims to become covered in brake dust, road dirt, and other grime that accumulates while driving.\nIf your rims haven't had regular cleaning and are quite dirty, you should begin by using a stiff bristled brush as shown in the image above. With a bucket of soapy water, simply scrub the brush in and around the rims, removing the majority of built up grime. Once this step is complete, you can give the rim an even cleaner look by using a bit of Windex and paper towels to clean in the nooks and crannies and give your rims an eye catching shine.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYY/9KR0/IJ8WXNLS/FYY9KR0IJ8WXNLS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSP/I5IA/IJ8WXNIW/FSPI5IAIJ8WXNIW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Exterior - Rims"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "For this step, we will be discussing the lights and windshield of your car. You may be wondering, as with the rims, aren't these things that would be cleaned in a car wash? The answer is yes and no. They will undoubtedly be cleaned, but the large, fast moving brushes used in car washes aren't great at sufficiently hitting these small, key areas. With a little TLC and some elbow grease, you can get these areas shining like they were professionally detailed at the dealership.\nTo begin, grab some Windex and paper towels. When you clean up you headlights and fog lights, not only will they shine and look much better, but you will also have better vision at night. The same thing applies for when you go over your windshield. This is an area that car washes will clean, but upon closer inspection you will notice that there is residual grime on the glass that is only easily removed with some glass cleaner and paper towels.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9F/YHOE/IJ8WXNEP/F9FYHOEIJ8WXNEP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXN/WZI8/IJ8WXNI8/FXNWZI8IJ8WXNI8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Exterior - Lights and Windshield"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The interior of a vehicle is undeniably important to remember for regular cleaning. The interior makes a big impression on people when they get into your vehicle.

Not only will this improve the appearance of the car, but it will also decrease dust and allergens in the air and improve smell.\nIt is also important to use a surface cleaner, preferably Armor All, to go over all the hard surfaces inside your vehicle. This will remove any messes on the surface while also leaving a long lasting shine, making your car look like new.\nFinally, something entirely too many people fail to do, comes decluttering. Removing any trash in your car will make it appear much cleaner and give you a sense of pride in your vehicle. The final image shows the interior of a 2006 Ford Focus.

This leaves two ends which are left open and called the narrowest sides.\nEach small stone height is 8.5 inches, the long side is 3.5 inches, the short sides are 2 3/4 inches and the shortest side is a half an inch.

All lines appear to terminate about 3/4 of an inch from the shortest side on the two short sides.\nIgnoring the inaccuracies and obvious prop changes from 1:52:40 through 1:53:15 the following appears to hold true.\nWind has 6 sine oscillations in the sky at the long side which start from the left going downward then rising upward once before terminating on the right. from 1:55:14 the short sides show up then down sine propagation.

This also makes the room look bigger.\nFunny side story - because using two doors would have been quite pointless I decided to shut the left one permanently.

The LED array is mounted in a space in the top of the unit which has a cut-out to allow only the light to come through. The LED lamp is an array of 5W LEDs of specific types. Please note that not all grow lamps are made equal. I tried cheap ones, expensive ones and even some strange ones but in the end went with the ones below. Use the LED specs below and compare them to the lamp you are buying for success.\nEDIT:\nThe LED's in the 90W UFO are as follows:\n6 x 5w Deep Red leds, 13 x 5w Red leds, 3 x 5w Blue leds, 1 x 5w Orange led, 3 x 5w White leds, 1 x 5w UV led and 1 x IR led at just the right spectrum required for efficient plant growth.\nYou could also use the new style COB (Chip on-Board) style lamps. The 100w lamp consists of:\nDeep Red: 660nm x 28 leds, Orange: 640nm x 16 leds, Violet: 440nm x 8 leds, Blue: 460nm x 4 leds, Light Blue: 470nm x 4 leds, Green: 525nm x 2 leds, Hyper Red: 730nm x 2 leds\nThe light given off by the new style COB lamps as a much deeper purple and as of yet they appear to be just as effective.

Safe to say, there is an air pump mounted in the top section which keeps the water agitated (bubbler system) and I needed to make sure it wasn't too loud as I didn't want to hear it running.\nAfter going through almost a dozen different pumps I ended up using a Hailea ACO-9610, this is a 4 port air pump and I just used some extra small pieces of pipe to shut off the unused outlets. It was placed on small section of anti-vibe foam making sure not to block the air inlet in the pump\nFor the fans, I wanted to make sure all the fans were adjustable individually so a 4 Fan, 3.5\" Bay Panel Fan Adjuster was used. This is powered using the molex in a PC which meant we needed to get molex in there somehow. Back on the internet and I got an external molex power supply. The Fan panel was then plugged in to that and then the fans in to that. That was it, 3 plug sockets were needed in total, one for the lamp, one for the fans and one for the pump.\nAfter trying to keep the fans as small as possible but shifting the right amount of air, 120mm PC fans were used as an inlet and outlet fan. There was also an issue with the top section overheating due to the lamp. This mean a 80mm fan was used in the top section, sucking the hot air out. This worked perfectly. The fans were Arctic F12's and the small one was an Arctic F8. Each one had the temperature sensor removed by me, lovely and quiet and nice and cheap.\nThere were a couple of extra cables used to the get the fans where I wanted them, cheap fan extension cables for PC's were used and cost less than \u00a32 each.\nNow the subject off Hydro feed is a tough one as everyone likes to use their own concoction and brands etc. I used a Hydro Carboload for the tomatoes, Growth Technology for the Grow, Bloom and Silicone. Each feed or make has a different feeding regime but I fed mine once a week (same day every week) whilst doing a water change. When you top up the water throughout the week DO NOT use any feed in the water solution, just top up with pH'd water. The top-up water needs to be pH'd to suit your plants as does all water used in these types of grow set-ups. Ideally too the water should have sat for 2-3 days to allow the chlorine to dissipate.\nYou can use manual or electronic pH meters to pH your solution, I was lucky enough to borrow an electronic one.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFK/NT2O/IJ7WO25V/FFKNT2OIJ7WO25V.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Pumps and Wiring and Feed"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "As you can see from the pictures, the unit worked beautifully.

But since this is not an extremely critical application I decided to buy lenses with a specified angle of 15 degrees.\nThe next choice is the color of the LEDs. Plants essentially only need red and blue light for photosynthesis, but these purple looking plants lights might not be something you want to have in your living room window. Instead white is probably the color of choice, but which white: cold white, warm white, neutral white,...\nI finally placed my order:\n50pcs 15 degree led Lens for 1W 3W High Power LED with screw 20mm Black holder\n50pcs 3W neutral white 4000-4500k LED + 20mm star PCB\n...and the waiting began.

My living room window is 250 cm wide. I knew from previous projects that I could easily get different aluminum profiles in lengths of 100 cm and 200 cm and decided that a total length of 200 cm would enough for this design.\nSo how many of the 50 LEDs would I need? I made sketches with LEDs spaced 7 cm, 8 cm and 10 cm apart. In commercial LED strips and even many LED light bulbs you will find groups of 3 series connected LEDs with an additional dropper resistor giving a system voltage of 12 V.\nSo my options were:\n7 cm spacing: 9 groups of 3 LEDs or 27 LEDs\n8 cm spacing: 8 groups of 3 LEDs or 24 LEDs\n10 cm spacing: 6 groups of 3 LEDs or 18 LEDs\nI decided to go for solution 2 with a total of 24 LEDs.

I have used star-based power LEDs before, but I have never seen them on this kind of framework - directly off the production line. The soldering certainly looked ok, but there was a lot of flux residue and heatsink compound around the chips on the background of the black solder mask on the boards.\nMy first plan was to construct an individual driver circuit for groups of three LEDs in series. But then on the other hand, I wanted to finish this project before the darkest time of the year really set in. Therefore I decided on the much simpler circuit which is also used on the regular type of LED stripes and in many LED bulbs: three LEDs in series, connected to a 12 V power supply with a additional dropper resistor in series.\nThe general idea is that individual variations between LEDs will cancel each other out when connecting a couple of them in series. The dropper resistor will then stabilize the current through the string of the LEDs. However, when you buy your LEDs from an unbranded Chinese supplier, you will not get any reliable data for the LEDs. Even the power rating might be more wishful thinking than reality...\nIn order to properly design the circuit I hooked up three LEDs while these were still connected to the cake of 25 LEDs and with my bench power supply I measured the \"typical\" characteristics of these three LEDs. You can see the current-over-voltage and power-over-voltage curve in the graph above. The LEDs were actually sold at a rated power of 3 W each, however at 3 W the current-voltage-curve already looks as if it was dominated by the internal series resistance of the LED chips.\nAs you can see, with a 2 \u03a9 resistor and connected to 12 V the LEDs would end up at a working point with a current of slightly below 500 mA and a power of 1.8 W per LED. A reasonable value I believe and that's also what I went for.\nWhat about the resistor and its power rating? At 500 mA there will be a voltage drop of 1 V over the resistor and hence it will dissipate 1/2 W.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVY/B45Z/IHZ8WWWT/FVYB45ZIHZ8WWWT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4J/EHLN/II0OCXR6/F4JEHLNII0OCXR6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH8/M68E/II0OD5OW/FH8M68EII0OD5OW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2A/J9M3/IHZ8WWFS/F2AJ9M3IHZ8WWFS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Arrival Day - Measuring!"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Having decided on the electrical design I went to the local hardware store Bauhaus and browsed through their supply of aluminum and plastic profiles.

of my domestic arrangements, I have one small oasis of perfect order. One thing that I can call 'organised' and 'fully functional'. One thing that I can touch and know that it is reliable and ready for action at a moments notice - and that is my wonderful home made Hackable Arduino Prototyping Board.\nThis vaporisation project was initially envisaged to be a simple fumigation machine for beehives, but very quickly got completely out of hand and developed into so much more than that. Indeed, people are now flocking from all four corners of my island to witness the amazingly performance of this machine as it sits in the centre of my living room vaporising all manner of exotic substances, including frankincense and cheese.\nBack to December ...... It is Winter 2015 and Sussex university has just published a report that concludes that vaporising oxalic acid is the best way to treat honey bees for the varroa mite. I must therefore build my vaporising machine immediately. There can be no delay .......... I wonder what else I can vaporise?\nThe varroa is a tiny 'mite' that lives on honey bees and in their brood cells, sucking the bee's blood for nutrition. It is not particularly harmful in itself, but it does carry some very nasty diseases which are very harmful to the bees and can cause complete destruction of the colony if kept unchecked. I must act now to protect my bees.\nThe treatment for varroa must be performed in the coldest part of Winter, when the amount of brood cells in the hive is at it's minimum as the mites can hide in these cells and completely avoid the oxalic acid vapour. The report was only released on the 17th of December and so the pressure is on for me to build my fumigation machine before the bees start to produce more brood in the early spring.\nFortunately, I have a whole load of electronic bits and pieces left over from previous projects, so with a bit of hunting around in my untidy workshop and unsoldering of a few components here and there I was able to build this project in time for the coldest part of Winter to arrive.\nApart from my illustrious hackable prototyping board, this project was very much designed as I went along and I made no drawings or sketches before hand. I drew the main vaporisation chamber in Fusion 360 as this was the most esoteric part of the design. Much of the metal tube and plate was picked up off the workshop floor or found in dirty rat infested boxes leftover from months/years/decades gone by.\nI am so pleased with the end result that the machine now doubles up as a coffee table in my lounge. Occasionally, if I am 'in the mood', I press the 'on' button and vaporise something, sometimes just for fun and sometimes to fill the air with exotic perfumes. Surely, this must be the most ridiculously over engineered air freshener ever built?", "title": "Arduino Controlled Beehive Fumigator / Air Freshener", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Controlled-Air-Freshener-Beehive-Fumigator/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "This Instructable actually has three major parts to it:\nDemonstrating the features of the prototyping board by doing an actual project on it.\nUsing and coding an Arduino to control a potentially hazardous process and produce warning sounds.\nBuilding an electrical heating device to vaporise and inject chemicals into a beehive to kill varroa mites.\nMost likely, specific parts of this projects will be useful to people, like how to use resistance wire to build your own heater and how to control a hazardous process using an Arduino. But most useful of all is the prototyping board and, yes, the files are included for building it yourself - you just send the files to Hong Kong with a few dozens of dollars and they post you back a stack of boards. The boards have even been thoroughly tested and debugged so you know they will be perfect.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Introduction"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The photo above shows a beehive being fumigated with oxalic acid using the traditional electrical heating pan inserted into the beehive entrance. Unless the beekeeper is wearing the proper mask, he will be exposed to very toxic acid fumes.\nThe question everybody will be asking is 'Could we not have a very long cable to the heating pan device?' and 'Why go to all the trouble of making a controller?' also 'Why not just have a battery and a big switch to operate the device?'\nAll of these questions are very worthwhile. Oxalic fumes are toxic to human beings and yes, we could have a long cable, a switch and a battery and hide in an underground bunker whilst operating the device remotely. Or we could use the existing products in the market place, which inevitably expose the beekeeper to nasty oxalic acid fumes.\nAs engineers it is our jobs to ask lots of awkward questions and look at all the potential problems in minute detail. Believe me, this will drive your boss crazy and he will soon start shouting obscenities in your general direction.\nIf we look at this device in particular, we can torment our imaginary boss with the following questions and statements:\n\"Brian, we need to be able prevent the beekeeper from being exposed to the oxalic acid fumes\"\n\"OK Tecwyn, we'll put the device on a long cable with a big switch and hide in a bunker\"\n\"Errrrr ..... Well ..... It's not quite as simple as that. We also need to be able to control the temperature at which we heat the powder\"\nTo which Brian answers: \"You engineers just love to find problems with everything. What's the matter with you guys?\"\n\"Errrrr ..... Yes ...... But that's my job isn't it?\"\n\"No\" says Brian, \"Your job is to make this device as quickly and cheaply as possible.\"\n\"We also need to make sure the device is cold before the beekeeper tries to put more powder in it\" I say, nervously.\nBy this time Brian, my imaginary boss, is reaching for a large bottle of whiskey in his desk draw.\n\"We also need warning lights or sounds to indicate that the device is producing fumes\".\nBrian replies: \"Well you've just succeeded in turning a cheap $50 product into a something ten times as expensive. Are you trying to bankrupt the company?\"\n\"No\" I reply, \"We have to make sure that the device does it's job properly and does not harm the beekeeper\".\nBrian now drinks the whiskey, reaches back in his desk draw for his pump action shotgun and I run out of the building as fast as possible with shots being fired behind me.\nPersonally, I can not give my imaginary boss the satisfaction of seeing me take short cuts and produce a second rate fumigation machine with no proper control system, so I MUST, I simply MUST do it properly or not at all!\nEventually, I calm down and write a short list of all the desirable functions of my controller, wondering if I've still got an imaginary job to go to in the morning:\nIt should warn the beekeeper that fumes are about to be produced so that he can either walk away to a safe distance or put on a suitable mask.\nIt should control the temperature at which the oxalic acid powder is heated to so that it is not 'overcooked' or 'undercooked'.\nIt should tell the beekeeper if the device is still hot so that he does not try to add more powder too soon.\nIt should reassure the beekeeper that everything is working properly, or if there is a fault somewhere.\nThen looking at the device itself:\nIt must have a fan to blow the fumes into the beehive.\nThe heating coil must produce enough heat to vaporise the powder reasonably quickly.\nThe heating coil should have a reasonable life expectancy, so should not be operated at too high a power.\nAll electrical cables must be tightly secured.\nIt must be properly tested to check for short circuits and leaks.\nHopefully Brian will be in a better mood tomorrow.\nAs far as the Arduino goes, the code to warn the beekeeper that the temperature of the pot is too high for refilling straight away would look something like this:\nwhile(heat > 100) {\nheat = thermocouple.readThermocouple(CELSIUS);\nlcd.clear();\nlcd.setCursor(0,0); lcd.print(\"Please wait while\");\nlcd.setCursor(0,1); lcd.print(\"the device cools\");\nlcd.setCursor(0,2); lcd.print(\"to below 100\");lcd.print((char)223);lcd.print(\"C\");\nlcd.setCursor(0,3);lcd.print(\"Probe Temp:\");lcd.print(heat);lcd.print((char)223);lcd.print(\"C.\");\ntone(A2, 300, 100); // plays a 300 hz sound for 100ms\ndelay(3000);\n}\nIn this bit of code, the K type temperature sensor is being read and it's value is declared to be 'heat'. The LCD screen is then cleared and a message is printed to tell the beekeeper that the pot is too hot and that he must wait until it cools down. An alarm noise is broadcast every 3 seconds as the code loops. The controller will stay in this 'while' loop until the conditions of the loop are met ie. that the 'heat' is no longer greater than 100 \u00baC.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F15/6MAO/IIOWRD4X/F156MAOIIOWRD4X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2H/9TFP/IJ6CCFHN/F2H9TFPIJ6CCFHN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Control of Hazardous Processes"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Originally, the prototyping board was born as a result of building a device for detecting methanol vapour around biodiesel production tanks. Basically, I got fed up with continually having to redesign one small circuit board for one small project so decided to make the board four times bigger and put all the features I could possibly need for all my current and future projects into it. The features are listed here:\n\nDetachable 4 x 20 LCD screen.\n10 amp relays x 4.\nUSB sockets x 6.\nDetachable Arduino Due or Uno.\nAbility to attach 3rd part shields direct to the Arduino.\nOptional hard wired detachable ATMEGA 328 chip.\nAudio buzzer.\nAudio amplifier circuits for high powered external speakers.\nK - type thermocouple circuit for high temperature probes.\nDC power regulator circuit.\nPotentiometers x 4.\nPush button switches x 3.\nVarious arrangements of empty pins in groups of 2,3 and 4 for general hacking.\n5V, 9V and ground busses travelling all around the board.\nMounting holes for bolting into a box.\nDouble sided, gold plated board, with very durable pin sockets for re-working (The board MUST be double sided).\nBe warned, the board does use some very small surface mounted components (SMC), but the EEVblog video tutorial shows exactly how to do this. The advantages of using SMCs is that we can use the most up to date components and they save a huge amount of space so more of the board can be used for other things.\nObviously, we could just buy a Thermocouple Amplifier MAX31855 breakout board from adafruit, or do what I do, which is to start of with one of these break out boards to test that my code works properly and then upgrade the board by hard soldering all the components on directly. The advantage with hard soldering is that the circuit is a lot more robust and resistant to vibration and general abuse out there in the real world. One thing to remember is that the MAX31855 chip has an internal reference temperature sensor and the chip does get slightly warm during use. Also, it needs to be positioned well away from any obvious heat sources on the board or otherwise, such as the LCD screen or the power regulators.\nOther things to be aware of are things like digital noise - is the coding too complicated? I had this problem with the 'one wire' system of temperature measurement - it gave too many errors.\nIt's important that our thermocouple circuit does not fail due to vibration etc. and so too our audio amplifiers. These circuits are giving us temperature readings and audio warnings about the status of the device and so are important safety features.\nIt is also important to me that the board is easy to use so, for this reason, I have annotated every single component with it's manufacturer's reference number or actual value so that when I come back to it a year or so later I can just read the text and solder in the components without having lots of other files or pages to read.

The oxalic acid is measured into the pot, the electricity is turned on and a blower pumps the fumes into the beehive. This device is electrically connected to the Arduino based control system so that the temperature can be monitored and the blower switched on at the right time. All we need is the temperature in the pot to reach the vaporisation (sublimation) temperature of oxalic acid point of oxalic acid: 175 degrees C.\nAdditionally, the coil is insulated from the pot by one wrap of ceramic fibre. A second layer of fibre then goes around the outside of the coil and the whole assembly goes inside another, bigger, stainless steel tube or 'shroud' to protect it from the elements.\nEssential dimensions:\nSquare plates: 86 x 86 x 3mm\nStainless pot: OD 19, ID 16 x 25mm long\nStainless shroud: OD 38, ID 34 x 80mm long\n24 gauge kanthal 01 x 300mm long on 12 volt battery\nBolts (not shown): 5mm\nThe power of the heater is given by the type of wire and it's length. When I assembled this heater I tested the amps going through the wire with a clamp meter and 12v car battery to check that there were no short circuits between the wire and the stainless components and also between the individual coils of wire touching each other.\nThe coil wires get attached to insulated post terminals (not shown) which screw into the bottom most plate and the thermocouple wire (last photo) pushes in through a small 3mm hole in the centre of the bottom plate up as close to the underside of the vaporisation pot as possible, but not touching it.\nWinding the coils around the stainless pot is quite fiddly as the wires are very springy.

The cabinet would therefore be fitted with speakers and an additional audio amplifier board fitted to the prototype board, if I can find space for it?\nTo get the most out of the speakers, they needed to be fitted in their own little plywood boxes and screwed into the cabinet.\nThe cabinet might, at first glance, seem a bit over the top but the electrical power draw when everything is running is quite high and so an old car battery was mounted in the bottom floor to provide enough energy for fumigating at least 13 beehives in one session.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5T/QWII/IIYUR590/F5TQWIIIIYUR590.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAW/VQ8G/IIYUR5CR/FAWVQ8GIIYUR5CR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL9/H776/IJ0A9CNP/FL9H776IJ0A9CNP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Making a Cabinet for the Machine"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "In a project like this, we can never have enough warning sounds, whether they be beeps, sirens or other special effects borrowed from the NASA website.\nSome really cool beeping noises can be made on the arduino uno using the following code that I wrote myself:\n// make beeping noises at increasing frequencies depending on temperature:\nfreq = startfrequency;\nbeeps = 0;\nbeepBeepThreshold = beepthreshold;\nwhile(beeps < numberofbeepsmax){\nif(heat > beepBeepThreshold)\ntone(A2, freq, 9); // play a note from pin 2 at freq for 9ms\nbeeps++;\nbeepBeepThreshold = beepBeepThreshold + 10;\nfreq = freq + 100;\ndelay(10);\n}\nEarlier on in the code, the K type temperature sensor was read and it's value is declared to be 'heat'. The arduino now produces a series of beeping noises of increasing frequency, based on the temperature reading. When the device gets hot, a dramatic rapid series of loud beeps of increasing pitch are produced every second to indicate how hot it is without having to look at a screen.\nUnfortunately, the 'tone' function does not seem to work on an Arduino Due.\nFor added drama, I thought that a second world war air raid siren and some NASA rocket launch audio might be fun. This was cobbled together in 'Fruity Loops' and windows movie maker (see video).\nI added a couple of audio boards to the project, one, the Adafruit Stereo 20W Class D Audio Amplifier - MAX9744 and two, the Adafruit Audio FX Sound Board - WAV/OGG Trigger with 16MB Flash. I wanted my home made bleeps and the NASA sound effects to be REALLY LOUD! Strangely, the bleeps ended up being much louder than the audio files, even though they were put through different channels of the same amp.

This poor guy had been abandoned for quite a few weeks by the dumpster at the place where I work. I had thought the design was interesting but the construction and materials were not enough to convince me to grab something I did not really had any use for at the time. Since then, I had to use the desk that was holding my liquor as a workbench and was left with nothing to call a bar. So it was time to save something from the dumpster and get some refurbishing done.\nAfter a ridiculous amount of time trying to fit it in the backseat of my car I learned a valuable lesson: don't try to fit anything longer than 3 feet on a mustang if you can disassemble it. I did that at night, alone, and it took me a long time with no success to realize that the whole thing was held together by 4 screws with loosely attached wing nuts. I felt stupid but then again I was finally on my way home with a future neat lookin' mini bar on hand.\nOther than a sturdy half inch plywood base the rest of the display is very lightweight. The barrel walls are a bit less than 1/8'' weak plywood stapled in shape on a pair black MDF rims and two MDF boards, one on the top and one on the bottom of each barrel (see picture).\nOverall the structure is sound but the MDF needs hiding as I find it very unappealing. It also sat in the weather for some time before i got it so it had some water damage albeit not an extensive one.

And of course, have fun.\nAfter disassembling and numbering all the black plastic belts so that the holes would match, I sanded the barrel walls with 220 grit until smooth to the touch.\nThe barrel body required little sanding, but the faded crude color was definitely not appealing.

I did that with a mini propane torch fitted with a heat deflector. After blackening all the surface I filled the holes with beeswax that mixed with the soot, forming a black wax. I then proceeded to wrap a rag around my finger and smooth everything out.

It can also been used as a race car.\nBuild or buy a compact sofa bed which can still comfortably sleep two.\nDivided Rooms\nWhen it comes to double duty rooms, things can get complicated. When I lived in a small studio apartment (a single room for living, eating and sleeping, with a single window) I did not want to subdivide because it would make the space unbearably small and dark -- but I didn't want to feel like I was in my bedroom all day either! So I got a very low bed, which I placed in a corner behind some counter-height bookcases. These divided the space, provided storage and hid the \"bedroom\" but did not cut light or make the studio feel any smaller, because my field of vision was not obstructed, I could see the full size of the room even though the sleeping area was hidden.\nNowadays my office is also my dining room, which forces me to be more organized and clean up at the end of the work day (always a good thing). To keep it looking like a dining room I use non-officy furniture, put plants in the window to distract from the computer monitor and printer (placed in the corners) and hide most of my files, supplies and tools throughout the apartment.

A wall-mounted toilet (with the tank built into the wall) will not only make increase your precious floor space, it will be a whole lot easier to keep clean. The goal, when dealing with a tiny space, should be that nothing needs to live on the floor or on the working surfaces. You might not succeed 100%, but you can get close.\nMind proportions!\nFor example, if you have a small bathroom, don't use large tiles... they will make it seem much smaller. Don't put a large overstuffed sofa in a tiny living room (hint: vintage furniture tends to be smaller), and avoid a king-size bed like the plague unless you live in a huge empty loft.

Or under sofas, if they can't be stored vertically.\nUse walls for storage: kitchen knives, for example, are perfect on wall-mounted magnets: they won't cut your fingers in drawers, or eat up counter space in wooden blocks.\nUse your dining table as a play fort. Most kids love to build indoor houses to lounge in, and there is no shortage of expensive kits on the market which are guaranteed to get in the way. Instead, drape fabric over your existing table so it reaches the floor (you can sew a few old sheets together for a custom fit in a couple hours), add a few pillows and you've got the coziest fort in the world.\nAlong the same vein, hang some fabric in a doorway or from the top bunk of a bed to make a puppet theater you can roll up (you can also go nuts with your sewing machine here, creating a beautiful theater with velvet curtains, and using dowels to ensure the stage keeps a nice rigid shape.\nOne word of warning\nWhen your stuff is stuffed under, behind or on top of every piece of furniture, your space will look cramped fairly quickly. It will feel as small as it is. To avoid oppressive clutter, leave a few strategic spaces free and clear. If you've got a tiny bathroom, DON'T put a cabinet (or anything else) under the sink. If you have books or boxes stacked under every side table, take care to leave the most prominent one clutter free -- and hide as much junk as possible behind doors, or with simple drapes.

You can pick up a sheet of 3/4\" melamine from any big box home center.\nI cut the tops for two benches and the table, with the knowledge that I would have to do two separate bench pours. The finished top is 36\" x 36\", so I added 3 inches to each side and made a 42\" x 42\" top. The benches finished top size was 24\" x 12\", so I made them 30\" x 18\". I then cut a whole bunch of stock for the sides at 2.5\" wide. This dimension will be the thickness, so pick the size that you want taking into consideration the strength of the concrete you're going to pour, the total span, and of course how you want it to look. I wanted a beefy looking top, and was pouring relatively low strength concrete (4000 psi with minimal glass fiber for this project), so I went fairly thick at 2.5\". I marked out where I wanted the edges of the finished pieces on the melamine as a guide for the edge bracing.\nI made all the edges with the melamine and various plywood scraps I had laying around, forming a \"L\" brace, using pine pieces for screw and glue backing. Glue doesn't typically stick well the melamine, so I used epoxy (which still only sticks a little with some roughed up melamine). For extra holding power I used some trim nails to hold it in place while the epoxy set up. I set the blocks every so often, always with one on the start and end of the piece, so I could screw together the side supports. I also immediately filled the finish nail head holes with epoxy, then used a card scraper the next day to flush them up to the melamine. This both keeps the surface impermeable, as well as smooth.\nNext drill and countersink holes on each block to hold the edge guides down, as well as to each other. Use the previously marked lines as guides while setting them. Find the right length screws, and screw it all together.\nI also made a knockout in the center, which was just a 12\" x 12\" plywood piece, with a little frame screwed to it for a final thickness of 2.5\" to be flush with the outside edges. It's quite helpful if they have the same height so you can screed off the wet concrete easily later. Then I used some air sealing tape (tyvek stuff and some stuff left over from underlayment) to seal exposed plywood edges. If unsealed, they wick up the moisture, swell, and either ruin your concrete, eliminate the ability to re-use the forms, or both.\nI also knew I was going to use some angle aluminum to hold the drop in insert, so I cut some pieces and used silicon to hold it down.\nNext I used black silicon to seal all the corners, which can be a bit of a mess, but is a quick and cheap way to seal and make a slight rounded over edge in the final piece. I've started using a better way now, but that'll be in a future instructable. Make sure there's no place for water to wick into the edges of your plywood pieces -- it'll wreak havoc in the future.\nThis would have been a great time to wax everything down as a mold release... but I didn't and you'll get to see my pain the next steps.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Make Your Concrete Forms"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I bought a bunch of 3/8\" rebar from my local home center to add some extra strength to the table top.

Once I got started, I figured I could throw it in the benches as well as insurance. It's obvious now that it was completely unnecessary in the benches.\nI started off cutting it with a bolt cutter, but this was a bit too much work and the cut off pieces tended to shoot off at high velocity. I switched over to the angle grinder, which worked like a champ. Make sure your rebar doesn't get any closer than 1\" from the edge, any closer and you risk having it settle and shift over during pouring and being exposed, or potential rust visibility in the future.

I'll be going back to quickcrete 5000 psi next time.\nFirst, make sure your forms are good and clean of any debris, spray it out with some air if you have it.\nNext, make sure to mix the concrete according to the directions, you definitely don't want it too wet or too dry. I like to add my integral color to the measured water and mix before pouring into the dry mix.

Unfortunately, since I generally work alone, it's not a great time to go all Ansel Adams and photo op this thing too hardcore.\nKey's for me, mix well, pour in 1/2 the concrete, set the rebar in place, place the remainder of the concrete, use a concrete vibrator to get everything settled and remove air bubbles, screed, and then trowel the top surface (the bottom of the final piece since I'm casting everything upside down).\nThe red colorant made it look like a scene from Dexter, but the concrete had the desired color.

I had no trouble removing the benches, even without adding any mold release. Just remove all the screws and gently separate the mold from the concrete using wooden shims or pulling.\nThe table top on the other hand posed some significant challenges. First off, turns out 3 bags of concrete in the table top weighs a lot (say 240 lbs... like it said on the bags...), one of the keys to a happy marriage is to limit the amount of heavy team lift items you try to rope your wife into lifting with you. So I spent a considerable amount of effort to demold it and flip it by myself. Then once I did, I realized my error in not using any mold release on the center section.\nThis is where you get to carefully but forcefully let it know who's boss. I at first tried to just pound it out. That was a bad idea and broke out a bunch of the concrete edges, so don't do that. Then I got out my drill and reciprocating saw and cut out the center, and made a series of edge cuts, stopping just short of the concrete, which doesn't saw well with a wood blade. That at least got the wood out. Then I struggled with the aluminum, since there was no mold release, it bonded quite well to the concrete. After trying various forms of hitting it with things, I switched to the old faithful blowtorch approach. Aluminum transfers heat well, and expands under heat, so apply a short burst of heat to the aluminum and it should pop free. It did break out some small concrete on the ends from the expansion, but it at least got it free of the mold.\nNext, I brought it out into the yard and did my wet polishing. There's a lot of good resources here, and given the cold and complete mess with all the water, I didn't take any photos of this part. I bought my wet grinder on amazon for $225 - it's certainly not the best quality, I do get shocks from it, so I tend to wear a lot of rubber gloves while using it. The shocks aren't so bad, you get used to having an unintentionally strong grip on the tool. It supposedly has a GFCI on it, and I always plug it into a GFCI outlet, so the shocks must be pretty small since they never have tripped either GFCI. I took it all the way up to 3000 grit on the show sides.\nThen while moving it back in, I dumped it off the wheelbarrow in the grass, and it was the season opener for deer hunting, so all my lifting friends were out hunting... So I had to break my marital harmony rule and ask my wife to help me get it back up safely.\nNow you can seal and shine it all up. You need to wait a time period for the concrete to cure before sealing it, just read the label for your desired sealer to make sure you've waited long enough. I use a silicone based sealer from quickcrete, which works well. Flood all the surfaces several times until it stops taking in fluid, wipe it clean and then polish it. I have used automotive waxes with reasonably good results, Carnuba based waxes are the hardest, so use them if you can. A good helper (my 4 year old) can man the power buffer. I also melted some paraffin wax to fill some of the larger voids, I tried a skim coat, but those just never seem to adhere well, so I reverted to at least smoothing it out with wax.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNM/E6WO/IIYZ2ZG0/FNME6WOIIYZ2ZG0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFX/19YQ/IIYZ2ZG9/FFX19YQIIYZ2ZG9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVH/KOWU/IIYZ2ZGD/FVHKOWUIIYZ2ZGD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW5/JV82/IIYZ2ZGT/FW5JV82IIYZ2ZGT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYC/6ISL/IIYZ4570/FYC6ISLIIYZ4570.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWL/9V9X/IIYZ43WQ/FWL9V9XIIYZ43WQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD8/EPKK/IIYZ457E/FD8EPKKIIYZ457E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTQ/S1UF/IIYZ457H/FTQS1UFIIYZ457H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Q/RRJR/IIYZ457V/F8QRRJRIIYZ457V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAZ/2AO2/IIYZ453Z/FAZ2AO2IIYZ453Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXX/K0XW/IIYZ455Z/FXXK0XWIIYZ455Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7J/OMM6/IIYZ44ZX/F7JOMM6IIYZ44ZX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVK/7AH8/IIYZ456I/FVK7AH8IIYZ456I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCA/6MK4/IIYZ44ZY/FCA6MK4IIYZ44ZY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUX/7A6R/IIYZ4524/FUX7A6RIIYZ4524.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMA/S6QZ/IIYZ452Q/FMAS6QZIIYZ452Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJB/GQKQ/IIYZ453Q/FJBGQKQIIYZ453Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT1/6ROW/IIYZ459N/FT16ROWIIYZ459N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZP/4UE7/IIYZ45AN/FZP4UE7IIYZ45AN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Demold and Polish"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "I used 2\" x 4\" and 4\" x 4\" Douglas Fir lumber for the bases, which you can pick up from most any home center.

I have the luxury of owning a Festool Domino Joiner XL, which works great for this sort of thing. You could also certainly use something easy like screws to join it all together.

I wanted to use the stripe along the sides of the ottoman, so I sliced the bags open and used the best arrangement of the motif and printing. Again, as these are authentic bags, the design is just printed on the rolls of jute/burlap. It doesn\u2019t always follow the grain and definitely had printing and structural imperfections..including lots of flyaway fibers. That was okay with me, I liked the rustic imperfections. I did weave the pulls to the other side to keep them from catching on anything else.\nI found the best way to work with these bags was to place them at the center of each side, and work my way out to the corners. I folded the edges under just a little short of the corners, and stretched, joined and hand sewed the edges together at the corners (using strong upholstery thread) after all the sides were covered.

I stapled the BOTTOM edge of the lining just above the staples on the side walls, then folded the lining down (which hid the lining staples). I wasn't fussy and did not glue the corners, etc, and it looks fine. I covered the center support by simply folding the lining over the wood and securing with staples at the bottom.

Finally, I covered some cardboard with the lining fabric for the base of the box.\nI have a thing for welting on furniture, and already had 10 yards of cotton cord on hand, so I added welting to the underside of the cover.

But trying to drill through the fabric and batting to create all those holes proved problematic: the layers of fabric and batting kept wrapping themselves around the drill bit, ultimately jamming it.\nHence the previously noted \"Lesson Learned\" in step 3: minimize the bulk in the corners by trimming away excess fabric as you go. Because I didn't know that ahead of time, I had to adapt. SO, instead, I lined the plate up to the corner of the INSIDE of the box as shown above and (using the center hangar bolt hole as a guide), cut a drill-bit-sized hole in the lining, and drilled just one large hole (the same width as the hangar bolt) from the inside of the box to the outside. I could feel where the large drill bit had exited the wood and only had one place where I had to trim away fabric.\nThen, I fed the leg\u2019s hangar bolt through the OUTSIDE IN, i.e, up through the hole and screwed it up through the wood AND though the leg plate without needing additional screws. The plate functioned as a giant \u201cnut\u201d and the plate wouldn\u2019t turn any more because the corner had secured it in place.\nTHAT was my favorite hack, because I think having the bolt pass through the wood ultimately made the legs much more secure than they would have been with the traditional method.

The one thing it seriously lacked was closet space. A 5-month temporary sublet turned into a 5-year stay which gave me plenty of time to come up with creative storage solutions to utilize the apartment to its fullest.\n\nI'll cover my favorite IKEA hack, vintage accessory, bike storage, shelving upcycle, furniture repurposing, organizational bin win, and a few others. I was able to do basic woodworking to make these ideas possible at Techshop in San Francisco, although not all the projects here require tools.", "title": "9 Alternative Storage Ideas", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/9-Alternative-Storage-Ideas/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I needed a little extra storage in my kitchen and preferred it be open shelving. Since I didn't own the space, I wanted to make minimal impact on the building itself and avoid nailing anything in place. This solution came together pretty quickly once I understood the needs.\n\nUsing leftover, scrap plywood from other projects, I built and installed this friction-fit shelving system. The bottom two layers are twice as tall as the upper (11\" vs. 5.5\") which worked out serendipitously for the sizes of things I wished to store. The eight cents estimated cost was the brads I used to secure the lip to the bottom board of each shelf.\n\nThe whole system was created based on initial measurements and then cut first to be oversized. I took the pieces home, measured a second time with all the pieces in hand, and marked cut lines for exact fit. The right vertical support is fitted in between the window frame and rear wall and the left is freestanding against the cabinets. The five shelves hold the vertical supports in place and the window frame keeps the system nice and stable. It seems precarious to think about not bolting this into the wall, but trust me - it's quite stable.\n\nMethod Notes\n- This system is essentially an H with five cross bars. The vertical supports have identical dado cuts to allow the shelves to slide in and out, which is important because the shelves hold the vertical supports in place. To make it easier on yourself, take your measurements of where you want the dado cuts and then cut both the left and right vertical support for each level before moving the fence. This will ensure a nice, level slot for the shelves.\n- No fasteners are used to anchor this system to the wall or anywhere else.\n- All shelves are identical, with the exception of the outer lips of the bottom two. These are slightly larger to ensure that the contents of the shelf stay safely tucked in.\n- Each shelf is simple construction of a bottom and front lip, nailed at the bottom by a simple brad on each corner. Using this method, each shelf will have a basic L shape when removed. Given the short lip of all shelves, I didn't feel a top brad was needed and never had a problem with wiggle.\n\nTo disassemble, you would just need to slide out the shelves individually and then lift away the vertical supports. When I moved out of this apartment, the next tenant liked these so much that I left them behind. They wouldn't do me much good elsewhere because they're custom fitted to this kitchen and besides, it gives me an excuse to build something new for the next home ;-)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTZ/39MP/IJ0A98EO/FTZ39MPIJ0A98EO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEX/VLXB/IJ0A99QX/FEXVLXBIJ0A99QX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU4/P0TA/IJ0A99Q1/FU4P0TAIJ0A99Q1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUL/G2XG/IJ0A99PB/FULG2XGIJ0A99PB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Eight Cent Shelving"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I converted a regular 1-drawer IKEA expedit insert into a filing cabinet and put it in my regular 5x5 expedit system.

The Oakland White Elephant Sale, usually. Check it out every Jan/Feb/March.

You can do this by setting the bike next to the unit you're planning to add the hook to and marking with tape or a pencil line where the top wheel naturally touches the vertical surface where the hook will be mounted while the bottom wheel is resting on the ground. From there, line up the bike hook so the natural resting place is the same for where the hook is placed and you should be set!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJT/O8QJ/IJ0A98GE/FJTO8QJIJ0A98GE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F36/9BNZ/IJ0A99OE/F369BNZIJ0A99OE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Bike Storage"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "This one is tucked into a closet but shows how to make better use when you are space constrained.
