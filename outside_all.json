As with many animals, Wood Ducks were hunted extensively and their habitats were destroyed to make way for farming and development.\nWood Ducks are one of a few waterfowl who happen to be cavity nesting birds. That means that these birds nest in hollow trunks. Old trees routinely rot from the inside and when a branch breaks off, it can leave a hole which the birds can use to enter the tree.\nThe Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 helped Wood Duck populations rebound by setting limits on what sort of birds can be hunted. Unfortunately, the Act could not replace the old trees that the birds would nest in. This box design was found to be an optimal artificial replacement for Wood Duck nesting needs.\nThree years ago, we decided to make duck boxes and donate them as a service project with our Cub Scout group. Building 60 boxes from 1\"x10\"x12' was prohibitively expensive but I remembered building them out of plywood and painting them as a kid.\nThese plans are designed to build groups of 15 boxes out of four sheets of plywood. They are changed from other plywood plans to minimize wasteful cuts and wood.\n(If you are interested in learning more, this resource from the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife is terrific: https://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/00406/wdfw00406.p...", "title": "Plywood Wood Duck Boxes and Plans", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Plywood-Wood-Duck-Boxes-and-Plans/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Manufacturing 105 duck boxes is no easy task so we have done our best to minimize all waste.

We had a source at Lowe's who would sell us plywood for dirt cheap but she left. So, because we have to pay full price AND buy paint then paint the boxes, we decided to switch to pressure treated. It costs $2 more per sheet but we don't have to buy paint, glue, or use time to paint them all.\nMaterials:\nYou will need 4 sheets of pressure treated plywood for every 15 boxes that you want to make.\nBosch 85601MC Router bit\n1lb - galvanized 4d nails (per 15 boxes)\n1 -extra sheet of plywood for mistakes and the jig\nTools:\nFraming Hammer\nTable saw\nJigsaw or CNC\nDrill and/or drill press (preferably)\n1/2\" router\nCircular saw\nnotes:\nGet the biggest table saw that you can get your hands on.

It should be roughly 5\"x4\" and be where your hole will end up. Box that board in with 2\" strips. This is your jig base.\nThen, CAREFULLY cut your 4.5\"x3.5\" entrance hole.

Put a blank in your jig. Then, start by drilling a 5/8\" hole. Use your router to cut out the hole. The bearings should keep you following the correct path. Check your hole dimensions periodically to make certain that they aren't getting bigger.\nDepending on how your jig is secured, you can also make your kerf cuts now.

For our example we'll be using the only tape that matters - DUCT TAPE. no specific brand but if you have a favorite go with it.\nPlastic card - I'm going to be using an old Discount card, but any similar plastic card will work.

Be sure to leave enough width for your split ring hole that we'll be making with the hole punch. The narrower the strip, the more tape you'll hold as the roll gets thicker, however this will also make the strip flimsy and difficult to use when you get down the end of tape through use. I generally keep the strip to a minimum width of 1cm. this leaves enough room for the hole and proves a study base to the tape. This strip is the basis for the EDC Key Chain Tape Carrier\nIf your using scissors, i recommend taking a ruler or straight edge of some kind and a marker to mark out your cut. It also helps to have scissors with a cutting edge longer than the length of the card your cutting to ensure a nice clean cut all the way across the card.\nIf your using an Xacto or utility blade, simply set the ruler to the width you need, make your marks and score the card using the blade and your ruler/straight edge.BE VERY CAREFUL IF YOU ARE USING A XACTO OR UTILITY BLADE. When you make your scoring cuts with your blade, your fingers will be very close to the path of the blade as it runs along the straight edge.Keep even pressure on the straight edge or secure it with tape to card and cutting board/mat so that it does not move while you score the card/plastic. Once scored you should be able to cleanly snap the strip off of the rest of the card(credit card) if you haven't cut through it. The membership card i used separated after about 5 passes.

This is to ensure that when you pull tape off of the Carrier it pulls evenly and does not tear the tape at odd angles resulting in runs and uneven widths on the roll.\nStart by pulling a section of tape off the roll your using, not to much, say a few inches at a time. Carefully stick the Carrier to the tape and fold it over so that the tape is now forming a roll on the Carrier. Continue to add layers by folding the Carrier onto the tape as you pull more off the roll. try and be as neat as you can when wrapping the tape around the strip to add layers.\nWe want that nice even edge on our Carrier, just like the edge of the tape roll that we mentioned above. Keep wrapping more layers onto your Carrier until you are satisfied with the thickness. Keep in mind your not going to carry an entire roll of tape (or are you?) using the EDC Key Chain Tape Carrier, but as I've shown here you can hold 5ft or more without significant bulk. With this amount of tape it weighs next to nothing.\nObviously the more tape you add the thicker it becomes,10ft of tape is about 1\" thick give or take a few mm depending on the width of the Carrier used. 5ft -10ft of duct tape may not seem like a lot, BUT its more than you would have if you didnt have the EDC Key Chain Tape Carrier, and since the tape is the full width off the roll (in this case aprox 2\" wide) you can double of triple your overall length by reducing the width of the strips you unwind tape off the Carrier", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FEI/22VQ/JTEN9YY0/FEI22VQJTEN9YY0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX4/TG7D/JTEN9Z0J/FX4TG7DJTEN9Z0J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F83/N0WA/JTEN9Z1X/F83N0WAJTEN9Z1X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F98/KY01/JTEN9Z4J/F98KY01JTEN9Z4J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJW/VJED/JTEN9Z6D/FJWVJEDJTEN9Z6D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWM/P3Z7/JTEN9Z3S/FWMP3Z7JTEN9Z3S.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Add Your Tape"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Ok so your almost done.

I took scissors and rounded off any sharp edges at either end and trimmed down excess card around the hole.

You now have an EDC Key Chain Tape Carrier.To use the tape, simply unwrap the length you need and tear it off or cut it.Never again will you be without the power of TAPE!\nI hope you enjoyed this Instructable and find it useful. This is my first attempt at an Instructable and I really enjoyed making both the EDC Key Chain Tape Carrier and the Instructable for you all to follow. This is a really simple project that even children can do with the supervision of an adult, and with a little adult prep (do the cutting and hole punching first, let the kids wrap the tape)even a very young child can make one of these. Best of all. Its cheap and actually useful. oh and your not limited to duct tape either. Electrical tape, painters tape, masking tape and others also work very well.\nYou can also use these as zipper pulls for you backpacks and bug out bags. etc etc. Literally any place that you can attach a split ring or key clip/carabiner you can add one of these. They weight next to nothing and can really save the day.\nPlease note: In the initial steps I mentioned using a 2 liter bottle as an alternative material source. This will definitely work and I had every intention of showing that process as well but i did not realize that today was recycling day and my supply of 2-liter bottles had just been collected for recycling as i sat down to put this together. I recommend Cutting the top and bottom off of the bottle leaving you with a smooth cylinder of plastic. Cut the cylinder length wise and you now have a sheet of plastic. IF you flatten it out with some heavy books for a day or two you will have more than enough material to make several of these.\nIf you find that your plastic card is to flexible you can add some rigidity to it by using 2 identical strips sandwiched together with some glue or by adding an appropriate size nail to the first wrapping of tape on the card. The nail will stiffen the card, and allow the tape to pull off easier when you use it because you can get a better grip on it. If you use the nail, be sure to file down the pointed end to avoid injury. I did not include images of this extra step as it came to me after the fact and I did not have a properly sized nail on hand. Also the nail will add weight and bulk.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAS/744X/JTEN9ZJP/FAS744XJTEN9ZJP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCQ/US5M/JTENAMVO/FCQUS5MJTENAMVO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFA/AKX1/JTENANI4/FFAAKX1JTENANI4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: FINAL STEP - Clean Up and Attach to You Keys/Caribiner/key Clip Etc."}], "channel": "Survival"}, {"category": "Outside", "description": "Has been 8 years now since I published my awesome Sawdustoven , one of my first winning projects.

I used some aluminum angle that I had in my garage to make 2 brackets and used a 1/4\u201d bolt to attach the motor to the brackets. This was screwed to the top of the door frame.\nB. I needed to extend the shaft on the motor, so I took a 3/8x3 galvanized nipple and drilled and tapped holes in it so I could use machine screws as set screws to lock it onto the shaft. I used 1/2\u201d all thread rod as the extension shaft. I also had to drill out the inside of the rod to get it to fit well onto both shafts.\nC. Finally, I made a mounting block to hold a 1/2\u201d nut for the shaft to run through to raise and lower the door. You can temporarily attach this to the door using a hot glue gun. The block should be set halfway up the threaded rod and in the center of the door.

Confirm operation of the limit switches.\nA. Turn on power and with the door opening, press the \u201copen\u201d limit switch. This should shut off the motor. If it doesn\u2019t, press one of the \u201cclosed\u201d switches which should shut off the motor.\nB.

What does this mean? Molding a lump of clay into a sphere by rolling it on the table or between your hands is an additive process whereas carving the same sphere from a block of square marble is a subtractive process. Be aware that at times, it may be easier to remove material to create a certain shape rather than by adding material to try and form that same shape.\nAs far as tools are concerned, literally anything can be used as a sculpting or texturing tool for clay. I force my students to make their own tools out of popsicle sticks and tongue depressors before they gain access to traditional tools to understand how the different shapes of their tools effect the clay (and because I\u2019m cruel).\nAs they can modify their tools easily, they discover which types of shapes they gravitate towards during different tasks. Often, even after they have access to traditional tools, most stick with their handmade tools for the bulk of the work. Whether your tools or homemade or bought, they all function pretty much the same and there are excellent sculpting tutorials online to get you started. But the important thing is to simply start. Try different things until something starts to look like the something you\u2019re after. As a rule, be gentle with your clay, it\u2019s a delicate and extremely malleable material to work with.\nIf your clay starts to crack and harden up, simply add a bit of water to it. Water is also used to smooth out the surface of the clay and to stick pieces together.\nUse different tools to impress different textures into the clay, this is one of the best things about sculpting with clay, take full advantage of it!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIN/7217/JSUOW4AH/FIN7217JSUOW4AH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: General Sculpting Guidelines"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "To sculpt the burger, I started by forming a sphere. The outline of the different sections were done with a sharp bladed sculpting tool (similar to a No. 11 X-Acto blade, so use that if you don\u2019t have this specific tool ). Because the clay is so soft, sharp bladed tools work better for outlining than a pointed wooden tool.\nOnce the outline has been established, I begin to shape the fish portion of the burger, using a flat ended tool I square off the middle section. I then use the blade tool again to demarcate corners of melted cheese. I use a dimpling tool (headless nail shoved into a wooden handle ) to create the fried fish texture on the sides of the patty. You\u2019ll notice as the clay is so soft that simply having held it while working on the other details will have squashed it just enough to resemble two buns.\nUsing the dimpling tool because it was on hand, I separated the rings of the small split ring and chained it to the x-small split ring. Then I inserted the small ring into the top of the fish burger so that the x-small ring remained proud.

I also let the clay dry for a little while and came back to bend and deform the edges, causing them to crack. I used the same technique on the fish stick.

As an art teacher; however, I would be betraying the oath if I didn\u2019t leave you with at least some tips to facilitate your learning process.\n- Working with acrylic paints can be tricky. Their beneficial fast drying time can also be their downfall. There are homebrew ways around this; however, the best method is to purchase a \u2013retarder. When seeking to purchase online, search: acrylic retarder. For those who prefer to support their local art shop, it is found on the shelves stocked alongside the acrylic paints. These retarders are great because they extend the curing time of the paint without altering its colour.\n- Another thing to keep in mind when using acrylics or any paint for that matter is carefully selecting the right type of brush. As a rule, natural bristle brushes should be used with natural paints such as oil paints; synthetic bristle brushes should be used with synthetic paints such as acrylics. White or gold Taklon bristled brushes is generally an economical choice for those who wish to dabble in painting with acrylics.\n- Brush shape isn\u2019t obvious either I know, but most small things can be painted with the same number 3 to 6 round brush. The tip allows for fine detail work and its side enables the artist to cover larger sections as well. An 8 to 10 flat brush is also good for covering large areas.\n- When mixing colours, it\u2019s important to understand the colour wheel from a painter\u2019s perspective. Without diving too far into colour theory, here are some take away tips:\no To dull and darken any colour, mix in variable amounts of its compliment, on the wheel it is the colour that directly opposes the colour you wish to darken or dull.\no To brighten a colour, add pure yellows instead of whites.\no You can make values such as black, grey and white warmer or cooler by mixing them with warm and cold colours. They will still appear black, grey and white out of context but placed next to other variants they will appear much different (explore the white, black and grey section of your local home center\u2019s paint swatch aisle if you need a better visual ).\no Certain colours cover more or are more lightfast than others. Generally, yellows and reds tend to cover poorly, whereas whites cover well. These paints will also seem thicker, generally it is due to the types of heavy metals, binders, and pigments used. In my experience, cadmium-based colours cover less well than titanium-based pigments for instance.\n- It\u2019s also a good idea to seek out mixing guides that certain paint companies produce for their pigments as they can help get you started. Research the brand of paint that you\u2019re using to see if they have produced a mixing guide.\n- Use painting palette pads instead of traditional palettes (less heavy metals are flushed back into our water tables ).\n- Use two water dishes when painting, the first (dirty ) for washing off most of the pigment, the second (clean ) for rinsing and charging the brush with water.\n- One of the most difficult things to fully grasp when starting out is to imagine what each colour will look like a shade darker while mixing, as acrylic paint dries a shade darker. When mixing, try not to match a colour exactly, aim instead to match a shade lighter than the colour you are trying to match. By squinting at your mixed colour, you should be able to perceive it a shade darker as your eyelashes darken your vision just enough. But it takes a lot of practice to nail it so don\u2019t become discouraged if you don\u2019t get it right away.\nA Side Note on Painting Lures:\nFish are attracted to reflective things, so I painted the back of most of my lures with iridescent silver paint.

With sand paper, a file, a small block plane, mini spokeshave, or utility knife, round over one of the edges. Along the top of that same edge, mark in pencil the depth of where you would like the hinges to end up. Determine an approximate width for the hinges and decide on their placement by placing the door onto the front of the stove. Cut out using your method of choice the openings for the hinges and clean up the bottom of the cut with a small pairing chisel and sandpaper.\nTo make the hinges, use one of the small pieces we milled up with the temporary zero clearance table or glue multiple popsicle or stir sticks together until the right thickness is achieved and mark the material that must be removed for the hinge to fit loosely. This material can be removed with a utility knife or sandpaper. Drill holes for the hinge pins (toothpicks ) into the ends of the door are straight as possible. Clamping up the door into a drill press vise and drilling them out that way is probably your safest and straightest bet. Once the holes on the door have been drilled, place the hinges into the openings and mark the where the holes must be drilled with a straight pin. Use a pencil to fill in the straight pin mark to be able to see it more clearly. Before attaching the hinges, sand the surfaces of the door to remove any pencil marks. Proceed to then carefully drill out the holes into the hinge pieces (a pin vise would be ideal for this delicate operation ).\nBe prepared to make the hinge pieces a few times as the wood tends to split. Then insert the toothpick hinge pins into place, the tight tolerances of the holes should be enough to hold them in by friction but a small dab of CA glue on the ends of the pins will keep them locked into place. Next, attach the door to the body of the stove temporarily with masking tape and glue the hinges to the front side of the stove.\nUsing masking tape as a guide to mark out the placement of the door\u2019s grate and handle. I found that the easiest tool to cut the stir stick pieces to length was a pair of wire stripper/cutters but a razor saw, utility knife, chisel, or even strong scissors will do the job. Use CA glue to attach your embellishments to the door. To make the handle for the door I used an off cut that I marked and sanded to shape. Then proceed by drilling a hole into the end that will be attached to the door to receive a toothpick. Drill a matching hole into the door.

During one of our get-togethers, she asked if I\u2019d be interested in doing the project for her. I jumped at it \u2013 with no chicken coop building experience, although I do have some basic construction skills. She had a couple of parameters for me to work with: 1) she wanted to be able to stand inside the coop to make it easier to clean out; 2) she wanted to house approximately 20 birds; and 3) she liked Quaker styling. With this info, I started searching my internet search for coop design ideas, helpful hints and sizing suggestions. My research turned up a recommended four square feet of coop space per chicken. I also learned about the free version of SketchUp software. I downloaded the software and started to play around to relearn some basic CAD (I hadn\u2019t drawn anything electronically for maybe 20 years). I have to say the SketchUp software is a great tool and much more powerful than what I needed for this project. If I need to do much of this type of thing in the future, I\u2019ll definitely spend the money on a license, it\u2019s easy to use and quite intuitive. Given the 4 ft2 recommendation, I spent a couple of evenings designing and redesigning an 80 ft2 coop. If I say so, myself, the design was pretty impressive, given my novice status with the software and coops in general. I printed up the plans and headed to Susie\u2019s house (about an hour away) to show the plans and get started. Shortly after arrival, I learned the plans I had created would be completely scrapped \u2013 the design was vastly larger than what they had envisioned. Argh! We chatted a bit more about what she wanted and I got started on the redesign with a pencil and ruler. An hour later, I had a basic redesign, reducing the overall footprint of the structure from 80 sq.ft. to 32 sq. ft. We got the thing down to a floor size of one 4x8 ft sheet of plywood!

I built the 4\u2019 x 8\u2019 floor frame out of 2x4s and used 4x4s for the elevation supports. I notched the 4x4s so that the frame would rest on solid wood lag screws through both pieces to prevent things from sliding around. I tied the bottom of the 4x4s together on each side with 8ft 2x4s to add stability (this also made it easier to level) and if there is ever a need to move the entire coop, they will act as skids so the thing can be drug to a different location.\nThe floor is one solid sheet of 4\u2019x\u20198\u2019x \u00be\u201d treated plywood (maybe overkill but I didn\u2019t want there to be peaks and valleys in the floor in two years or have to overbuild the foundation.\nAt this point, it\u2019s a good idea to place the base where the building is going to live, while it can still be carried by a man and two boys or two men. Dig out or fill as needed to level.\nOnce I had it leveled I glued a cheap sheet of linoleum to the floor, to protect against moisture from chicken poop; but, mostly to make it easier to clean out. I suggest using a cheap disposable razor knife to trim the linoleum, unless you want to wait until the adhesive cures enough and not gum a non-disposable", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ0/CI5K/JS0OQNRT/FZ0CI5KJS0OQNRT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Foundation"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I framed the entire coop using 2x4s, if I build another one, I\u2019ll use 2x3 or 2x2 \u2013 it\u2019s\u2019 definitely overbuilt for a chicken house and could have saved a few dollars here.\nThe nest box needed to be included within the 4\u2019x8\u2019 footprint (to avoid having to add another sheet of plywood). I shorted the hens here a little, the nest boxes are only a foot deep; but, having the box run the entire 8\u2019 length, each nest can be adjusted to be as wide as needed to optimize egg production.\nI\nframed at 16\u201d OC to the extent possible to facilitate efficient use of the 4\u2019x8\u2019 siding panels. Total height from bottom of the floor to the roof peak is less than 8\u2019 for the same reason \u2013 and there\u2019s no reason for it to be taller than that. The side walls are bout 6\u20192\u201d and the peak about 17\u201d above the top plate.\nThe rafters (truss?) are built to provide a 12\u201d eave to keep things dry and reduce erosion around the foundation. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t recall what pitch we ended up with (I think it was around 3/12); that same pitch was used for the roof portion of the nest box to give better aesthetics. There are some pictures a little further down showing the framing from the inside.\nRemember to miter the ends of the rafters to provide a vertical surface for the fascia boards later on.\nI framed for a window on each long side of the coop, to provide light and ventilation. Buy your windows before framing to be certain your rough opening is sized correctly. I tend to not consider natural warp in boards when framing, so dry fitting the windows prior to raising the walls allowed me to make some adjustments before the walls were put up.\nHere\u2019s where it occurred to me that I should probably be taking some pictures\u2026\nRoofing\nI chose to go with plywood for the roof with shingles. Partly for cost and partly because that\u2019s what I know. In hindsight, it might have made sense to use corrugated plastic or metal \u2013 depends on the look you\u2019re after. You might consider a semi transparent roof to let more light in, especially if you\u2019re in a climate that doesn\u2019t require insulation.

(post script \u2013 we didn\u2019t insulate this coop and the chickens all survived the cold snap)\nPrior to putting on the sheathing, I put the siding on the gables, and trimmed to fit the roofline defined by the rafters.

First, I tacked the sheet to the wall aligning with the side walls and squaring based on the floor. (Tip: I tacked some temporary blocks to stilts to help hold the siding in place, for nailing. This also helped to align the siding around the corners). With this panel tacked in place, I went inside to trace the outline of the door. Took the panel down, cut out the door and permanently installed the panel. Saved the cut out \u2013 that will serve as our door, later. Use a straight edge and circular saw to do most of the cutting and a sharp hand saw to control cuts into the corners.\nPrior to siding the wall with the nest box, I put the nest box roof on and installed the flashing and shingles to keep the water out. I scratched my head for awhile trying to figure out how to waterproof the hinges of the nest box roof. Then, as serendipity would have it, one of my nephews was messing around with a can of flexible rubber spray \u2013 doing what boys will do with a new cool toy, at least he didn\u2019t try to make his own rubberized chicken!\nI didn\u2019t think the flex seal would be the solution to this hinge issue; but, that got me thinking about that TV commercial where the guy tapes together two sides of a boat that was sawed in half. Off to the store I went to get a roll of 6\u201d rubber tape. This was the perfect solution in this application, flexible and water proof.

I wanted to share my experience in detail, but you can spend a lot less to achieve a similar result.\nFirst, you can play on grass or any other surface. The surface doesn't even have to be level. In fact, that can make the game less predictable and more fun.\nInstead of 6x6 timbers, you could use cheap landscape timbers that are set on top of the ground, which would cost about $175 instead of $1000. You can use half the lumber and only play in one direction.\nIf you let the lumber yard or hardware store cut your lumber, the only tool you really need is a drill, which is something you should own anyway. A capable corded drill should cost $30 or less.\nIf you decide to invest in a playing surface, you can use cheaper materials like stone dust.\nOther Resources\nI relied on many resources to plan and build my own court.\nBudget Bocce Court ebook\nCourt specs from Har-Tru\nAnother DIY court\nAnother method for building the border\nA discussion about surface materials\nPopular Mechanics article on building a bocce court", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FF6/US9S/JR6OI2CC/FF6US9SJR6OI2CC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 11: Costs, Tools, and Resources"}], "channel": "Backyard"}, {"category": "Outside", "description": "Hello Instructables,\nWow it has been a long time since I posted a project. A lot has changed since my last project. I have 2 handsome little boys, I started and currently running a small business in custom fishing rods and repair, I even have gotten sponsored for my rod building craft. It has been amazing. But you know the whole time I have been doing this, I have been thinking about you, instructables.com and the people that are on here. The community here is so special and so I want to get back to sharing my projects. So he we go...\nSorry, the first one back is for those, DIY fisherman, but if you do lure crafting and/or jewelry making, or anything that requires something to be turned while it sets or hardens, then this is for you too. I needed a multiple rod dryer for my fishing rod business, more specific, a 4 rod dryer. It has been a thought for some time now so I decided to build it. Yes, I could of bought it, but I really wanted to try my hand at some easy woodworking and some easy electrical setups. The goal of this build was to successfully build a dryer that would hold 4 rods, have a main on/off switch, along with each rod having their own on/off switch.

I wanted you (viewers) to feel like you were there with me brainstorming, how it was going to work. AND you really were right there with me. I had an idea and I really didn't know how exactly it was going to turn out so I took a shot and here it is.\nWhy are they so long...\nI felt, in order to express my passion and communicate the proper steps, I had to make it more hands on then entertaining; therefore longer.\nWhy is this Instructables so short...\nWell because of the videos being so long. This is for those wanting to try a build like this, to be able to come and get the schematics of the supports, bases, electrical, when ever they feel like it.\nFollow, Subscribe, and leave some LOVE!\nIf you are this far go ahead and leave me a follow, subscribe to my YouTube channel, and leave a like and/or comment.

Yes, you can safely and responsibly remove and reuse motors from a microwave(s). My opinion, my preference for what rpms to use, I like the rpm of my dryers to turn at most 15-18 rpms and at least 6 rpms. I have heard of other builders using around 2 rpms, but for me, that's way too slow. Then on the other side... I have heard builders using 36 rpms, again for me, way too fast. Having too slow or too fast does effect how epoxy/finish will set. Be cautious and test your rpms to make sure they are of your preferred speed at which you want the epoxy to be applied and set.\nI used 5 two pong rocker switches. one for the main on/off switch and the rest for turn on/off individual rods. Reason...I do work on multiple rods at one time, but I might have them done at different stages so I wanted the option to be able to turn on/off rods when they are not in use.\nWhen buy or making shaft couples, make sure they will fit the shaft of your motors.\nBase material and Caps for Chucks. I went to my big box stores to find these materials. I had a beautiful piece of leftover oak plywood I used for mine. PVC caps were just too expensive over Amazon or anywhere else, but my local big box had a good price.\nThe hardest part of the components to this build was...figuring out how to get the rods to be self-centered, but rigid enough to hold large diameter blanks. I brainstormed fitness bands, bicycle tubes, rubber-band/bolt method... Then I found it. I found 2 products on Amazon. The first one was these little kids' universal silicone cup caps that are used to stretch over your typical cup, that helps them from spilling and they have a straw hole that was already in the center for easy marking. They are the thicker ones' of the two. The second one are these universal silicone cup caps used for putting a lid on basically any container of around that size. The are clear and very thin compared to the other ones, but I am currently using both of them. To put the center hole in the silicon material on either one, I used a sharpened pipe to cut or punch a hole in the center.\nWhat ever product you decide use, make sure you measure your chuck and get the proper size to them...snuggly.\nCost:\nThe cost of everything was around $60.00 USD. Obviously, if you had to go out to buy the wood, your cost will be increased. It would probably take about 3-4 hours to make.\nLinks:\nAll links are under my video's description. *No I do not have an affiliate account with these companies, so I do not make any profit from you clicking or buying from these links.

To cut the curves of the two supports, I used two ways on the video. The first part was cut with a Jigsaw, and the second was cut using a hole saw bit in a drill press. If I could do it over again, I would use the hole saw method.\nFor reference, I drew a 20\" diagonal line from corner to corner at an angle of 58 degrees. If you know the equation for rise and run. 10 1/2\" Run and 17\" rise comes out to diagonal of 20\" at a angle of 58 degrees. From there, I marked the center of each chuck (pvc cap) on that line. See picture for placement. I also made sure I had a 1\" cushion on the bottom of the support to make sure the motor would not touch the base. If you use a different size chuck other than 2\", then your measurements will be different. Use a compass, to set the diameter of your chucks to mark the board. I set mine at 1 5/16\". I would use this to set up my curved rests for the motor stand and support stand.\nBases were cut from the same material. I made sure they were the same width. Now, because I am going to have 4 motors set up on one side of this thing. I made sure put the support board off center to the base with the wider side having the motors. I cut a dado that was the same width of the board used (1/2\") for the supports. I cut the dado on the table not using a dado blade, but my regular blade using a Kerf maker.\nI pre-drilled all my holes and countersink all my screws. No glue was harmed in this build.

I set the motors in parallel so that all motors would get the full 120 volts (US) no matter if one was switched off. If you set them up in series (which you can do) don't bother putting switches on because if the first one is off, they all will be off. Its like those old school X-mas lights. I could of soldered everything, but I want to make it as easy as it can possibly be, to all average Joe's. In my opinion, I think it would of been easier to solder all the connections, but I'll save that for my second one when ever I build it. To conceal all of the connections I made a little junction box with a switch panel on it. To make the wires neat and orderly instead of the hot mess like when I put it together (see video), I used coagulated electrical wire covers. No you don't need them, but I think they make it look a little nicer.\nCoat the wood with some kind of sealer and then you'll be done.\nThank you so much for visiting my Instructables and if you like this project.

We joke in the video about how this closely resembles the process of making a long-grain cutting board out of wood, because it's very similar.\nTo make the panel, we started by rough cutting the 4 hardwood strips to about 4 inches longer than the final length, which was 38.5\" (978mm). Since we're just rough cutting them, any saw capable of cutting wood will work here. We used a circular saw at the workbench.\nSince we're attempting to make a flat panel to build our deck from, getting the hardwood strips flat and square will help with that quite a bit. This part is completely optional but we ran each strip across the Jointer to make them perfectly straight.\nWe then ripped the three smaller strips to an equal width at the table saw. If you don't have a table saw you could set up a guide and use a circular saw to make these cuts.\nTo glue up the panel, we put the boards in order and then applied wood glue evenly across the entire edges of three of them. We then used as many clamps as we had to clamp all of the boards together and let it dry overnight.\nWhen the glue is dry, we used a chisel to scrape off any dried glue squeeze out and then put the panel through the planer to flatten it. This is another optional step. If you don't have a planer you could also sand the boards flat or use a hand plane to flatten the panel.\nTip: When gluing up a panel, ensure that you've got enough glue to cover every bit of the edges you're gluing together. Modern wood glues will cure harder than the wood itself so the only reason these joints would ever come apart is if the joints themselves were not glued up properly.

We weren't sure on exactly what shape we wanted so we spent some time looking for reference and inspiration on Google Images. Ultimately we decided on a pintail shape, based on a design from Gordon & Smith.\nWe copied the image and then pasted it into Photoshop. (If you don't have Photoshop, \"GIMP\" is a great free alternative with almost identical features.) We then \"ctrl\" + 'left click' the Layer to select the shape, [Select -> Modify -> Smooth] to remove any jagged edges, create a new Layer, and then use the Stroke feature set to 2px to give it a nice outline.\nSince we're going to finalize the outer shape by hand, we didn't need this line to be perfect.\nWe then printed out the outline at full size and taped it down to the table. The next step was to figure out exactly where the skateboard trucks were going to be placed. Since we aren't copying the original template at exactly the same size, the existing holes would not line up so we had to measure and make them ourselves.\nWe did this by aligning the trucks in the same spot they were on the drawing and then using a ruler and square to ensure they were centered and square to the deck. We then traced the holes with a pencil.\nLastly, we taped the deck outline down to some cardboard and used a utility knife to carefully cut out the shape.\nTip: Unsure on a shape, detail, or just a general direction to go on a project?

We did this first because it would allow us to use the straight edges of the panel to make sure the board was square to the work table. We did trace the outline of the deck onto the panel though so we could see where we wanted the carving to go.\nTo do the carving, we used the X-Carve from Inventables. You very much do not need to use a machine like this to make artwork on your skateboard deck. We enjoy using it because we have access to it and it produces a bold, dramatic look. If you don't have access to a machine like this, another great option is using a stencil or a screen-printing technique.\nThe artwork we're using is our Wicked Makers Skull logo. We offset it and rotated it a bit to get some asymmetry into the design, and then figured out exactly where we wanted it to go.\nWe used a 1/8\" straight bit in the machine and let it go to work. When it was finished, we used some sandpaper to go around each line to ensure everything was clean and free of burrs.\nNext, we covered the majority of the panel and sprayed a few coats of black primer spray paint.

This force will be plenty to bend the flexible plywood around the mold that has been made. If this is not a realistic option (we are very fortunate to have one of these devices), the same effect can be achieved by attaching heavy weights with a string.

Saves you multiple trips!\nYou can generally compost any fruits, vegetables or gardening cuttings, but DON'T add meat or dairy to your compost as these throw out the balance.\nStart your composting by adding a small pot plant worth of rich soil. Soil contains all of the micro-organisms that help to break down organic material and adding it at the start ensures you give your compost a \"kick start\"\nPlace your compost in an area that is warm, but out of direct sun. The organisms will produce heat during breaking down your food scraps and placing it in a warm position helps to speed the process up.\nMake sure you balance the moisture levels. Unless you are only composting water rich foods, you might have to add some water from time to time. Generally a good rule of thumb is to add the same water by weight as the scraps you are putting into the compost. You want to the \"pile\" to be moist, but not dripping wet. If your pile is getting too wet then add some saw dust or newspaper to dry it out.\nUse excess water in your compost bin as a liquid fertiliser.

There are several methods on doing this but the basic principle is to use an electrically conductive cover on the 3D print and use an electric current to move copper from a copper cathode to the 3D printed anode through an electrolyte. There are several good videos on how to do this on Youtube. I got part of my recipe from this one: CNC Kitchen copper plating\n-Tape the eyes before spray painting. Paint the 3D print with 2 to 3 layers of zinc spray. Zinc spray can be bought in most hardware stores. This alkyd paint spray contains a high level of zinc particles and can create a conductive coating on plastic 3D prints. Make sure to give the paint at least a day to fully dry.\n- Prepare the solution. I used a solution of 4 parts of distilled water to 1 part copper sulfate (in mass). I ordered the copper sulfate online. Add a table spoon of salt to finish the solution. Better solutions can be made by adding sulfuric acid, but I had proper results without it. It is important to use distilled water. It can be bought, but I made my own by by following one of the these methods: How to make distilled water\n! Don't flush the solution down the drain as it is quite toxic to the environment, discard of it properly at your local waste/recycling center !\n- Connect a power source to the 3D print and to a copper object. There is probably a proper way to determine what the best power source could be, but I had good results using a 12V adapter rated with a maximum current of 1500mA. In any case use a relatively low voltage DC power source.\n- The negative lead connects to the zinc covered part that you want to copperplate. Wind the stripped wire from the DC source or tape it onto the part. Connect the positive stripped lead wire from the DC adapter to a copper object. I used a copper plumbing pipe.\n- Submerge the part and the copper in the solution and make sure they don't touch each other. After an hour or so, a side of the part should be covered in a thin layer of copper. Turn the part around a few times to cover the different sides of the 3D print in copper. Any oxidation layers should be removed every now and then.\nMy result was far from perfect, probably because the partly submerged part and the lack of sulfuric acid. But I was happy with it for a first try! Also, it may be better to copperplate the two plastic body halves first and install the electronics afterwards.

The target audience that we chose to build this for was the Homeless population however, it does not have to be limited to that demographic.\nThe idea behind this project was that it would provide nightly shelter for those living at a homeless shelter which has limited space in housing. Instead of buying more housing, the shelter could provide more living spaces with these drain pipes. The pipes feature wood on inside walls to provide a warmer feel, a bed that can be changed into a chair while also being completely removable in minutes. There are LED strips running between the boards at the top, windows at the front & back, and cargo nets to provide storage next to the bed. At the back of the tube is an electrical compartment which houses a car battery which powers not only the LED's but also a USB outlet and two CPU fans embedded into the back wall. The battery is charged by a small solar panel that is mounted on top of the pipe.\nIn this Instructable, I will show how we built this project. This was a very time consuming project that took about 14 weeks to complete working about 8-15 hours almost every weekend. The total cost of this project comes in at about $3,100, these drain pipes cost about $2,000 and we spent about $1,100 in materials alone. This cost excludes the cost of tools which we used lots of and we actually got the pipe for free so maybe you can get lucky and find one for free as well.\nKeep in mind that this was a Prototype built for a class and that not everything is done perfectly.\nSome of the skills used for the build\nWoodworking\nSewing\nPainting\nWelding\nWiring\nCoding an arduino\nSome of the tools used for the build\nCircular Saw\nTable saw\nHammer impact drill\nRegular drills\nTable Saw\nJig Saws\nBelt sanders\nCrawl-bot CNC router (Not necessary)\nPaint brushes\nSpray cans\nBasic MIG Welder\nMaterials used for this build\nPine wood\nSteel 1in x 1in square tubing\nAcrylic Sheets\nTyvek Sheets (Not Necessary)\nNylon Sheets and Straps\nCar Battery\nWiring and various connectors\nPC fans\nSolar Panel\nVarious other electrical components", "title": "OccuPod - an Old Storm Drain Pipe Turned Into a Warm and Comfortable Living Space!", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/OccuPod-an-Old-Storm-Drain-Pipe-Turned-Into-a-Warm/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "To begin the project, we transformed the bleak looking pipe into something much more welcoming by mounting a bunch of 8 ft x 7.55 in x 1.5 in pine boards with Tapcon concrete screws.\nFirst off we painted the wood with a water tight seal & stain two-in-one. We did this so that the wood provides a warmer color but also allows us to wash the tube by pressure washing it. Then we had to cut off 2 inches off the end of the boards to make them fit perfectly into the pipe.\nTo mount them we used a scrap board and clamps to hold up the board that we were currently working on (as can be seen in the part 1 video). We pre-drill the holes into the wood with a wooden bit and then used an impact drill with a concrete drill bit to pre-drill the hole for the Tapcon screw.\nOne of the biggest obstacles when doing this was trying to avoid drilling into the re-bar inside the concrete of the tube.

However this didn't work as one layer of Tyvek was not strong enough, it tore at the seams when we sat on it. This could be improved if more sheets of Tyvek are used but is not necessary as two sheets of nylon worked pretty well.\nThe bed was hung by using anchor bolts and some Nylon buckle straps. The Nylon straps were sewn into the anchor bolts (as shown in the video) as well as onto the sheet of Nylon. The straps attached to the sheet had the buckles, however this could be done either way.\nNot shown in the video are the two additional eye bolts added at the end of the tube that allow the bed to be turned into a chair.

To know where to cut, we traced the inside of the tube against the sheet of plywood and cut that out. We also stained the plywood to keep the color of the wood used in this project consistent. Since the tube has a rounded edge where we wanted the door, the fitment was sort of tricky. So we cut the door oversize and then mounted it.

We ended up changing that so the box would be located at the bottom. This was done to save on head room and to eliminate the risk of a 25 lb car battery from falling on the occupants face.\nThat being said, we used the rest of the plywood sheet to scrap together a functional box that would hide the battery as well as a lot of the wiring, the solar panel controller, the LED controls as well as PC fan controls.

The white is actually too much light when the brightness is turned up all the way and can be annoying. The were placed to the sides so that light was still distributed throughout the tube without blinding the user when he or she was laying down.\nFor the windows, we used some thin sheets of acrylic which were cut into the shapes of the windows. The front windows filled in the gaps created by the front door bracket while the back window covers almost the entire end of the tube. The back window is almost the same size and shape as the front door. It also hinges on another metal bracket similar to the front door bracket and can be moved to access the electrical compartment while also doubling as a emergency exit for occupants. Above that metal bracket sits another piece of plywood which will later be used to house the PC fans.\nTo make OccuPod more private, a reflective film was added to the acrylic windows before they were mounted. This film works by reflecting light which works great throughout the day, but it is not truly one way film as we had thought. The idea was that it would always be reflective to the outside, however this is not the case as it will be reflective to the side with more light.

There is also a potentiometer on top of the electrical box which can be used to control the speed of the fans.\nThe fans are included to provide airflow in the summer months as the concrete soaks up the heat from the sun during the day. This heat is released at night which can be seen in the provided thermal picture.This is great in the winter months but could make for a very warm night in the summer.\nSpecial Thanks to Zane Cochran at HackBerry Lab at Berry College for helping us and guiding us as we built this throughout the semester!\nAlso a huge thank you to Katy for being a awesome group member and making this project come to life!\nAnd thank you if you have read this far and watched the videos!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2V/1WLI/JPN3LRBQ/F2V1WLIJPN3LRBQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHO/P4K6/JPN3L6J9/FHOP4K6JPN3L6J9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCW/IVQK/JPN3LCDV/FCWIVQKJPN3LCDV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Step 6: Adding the Remaining Details to Finish the Build!"}], "channel": "Survival"}, {"category": "Outside", "description": "Why should kids have all the fun?

A further complication arises when engaging in an activity such as cycling that requires grasping objects, compressing glove palm insulation reducing its effectiveness. Chemical warmers are bulky, often don't fit inside regular gloves and may not get heat to the fingers where it is needed.\nThe solution, a pair of thin liners with battery powered heat delivered to the palm side of all 5 digits that you can slide into your favorite glove! The heat is generated from carbon fiber rope attached a glove liner of your choice.\nUpdated Version\nI published an updated version that eliminates the gluing, exposed wires and results in a more flexible glove. You may prefer to build that version instead: https://www.instructables.com/id/Heated-Glove-Line...", "title": "Heated Glove Liners", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Heated-Glove-Liners/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Process\nThis project involves attaching carbon fiber heating loops to a pair of glove liners and wiring each to a 7.4 volt battery. The temperature generated drops as the length increases which is why 3 separate loops are connected in parallel. Since we are creating an electronic circuit the carbon fiber needs to go up and down each digit without crossing itself. One loop covers the thumb and back of hand, a second covers the index / middle fingers, and the third covers the ring / pinky fingers.\nIt is important that the glove is wired as indicated. Since the 2 spots where separate loops meet have the same polarity, there is no risk of a short circuit at that location should the loops touch.\nThe heating loops are temporarily tacked in place with fabric adhesive, then the wires and optional thermostat are connected. Finally a thin bead of flowable silicone is applied over the carbon rope. This provides a flexible attachment of the carbon to the glove, insulates the loops from shorting against each other, and protects the fine carbon threads from fraying.\nA switch and power plug may also be added depending on how you plan on using the gloves.\n\nWarm or Warmer?\nThe carbon heat rope linked to in the shopping list generates many times more heat than is needed in this glove liner application. Fortunately the rope is a loose weave of 12 smaller bundles of fibers which gives us the opportunity to both stretch our material further and customize how warm our gloves will get ... WIN WIN! After separating the smaller ropes we will re-wrap 2 or 3 of them back together.\nA glove I made with 2 bundles reaches about 38 \u00b0C when plugged directly into a 7.4v battery, and draws 0.53 amps. That is a temperature close to a commercial heated glove I have used, and a thermostat would not be necessary.\nA test glove I made using ALL 12 bundles draws a whopping 2.6 amps and gets hot very fast. So more bundles = more heat and a shorter battery life.\nI made a test loop out of 3 bundles and observed a current draw roughly 50% higher than a 2 bundle loop, so I would estimate a glove constructed with a 3 bundle rope to draw about 0.75 amps. That loop was noticeably warmer, though I couldn't get a good reading on my IR thermometer.

If you are making a glove using 2 fiber bundles you will need to cut 1 length of rope since the rope contains 12 bundles. If you are making a glove with 3 fiber bundles you will need to cut 2 lengths of rope in order to obtain the necessary 18 bundles.\nSeparating Rope Bundles\nSqueeze about an inch from one end of the rope to separate the bundles\nSlowly pull one bundle until the rope begins to bunch up\nUse one hand to gently propagate the bunch downward until the rope is straight again\nSlowly pull the individual bundle again until it comes out\nRepeat until all bundles are separated, it will be much easier once the first 2 bundles are removed\nMaking the Heating Loops\nClamp one end of the bundles for a loop with a clothes pin\nWeigh down the clothes pin so you can have 2 hands free for weaving\nWeave the bundles into a single rope\nwith 2 bundles simply wrap one around the other while applying light pressure\nfor 3 bundles alternate passing the outer bundles across the one currently in the center\nGrab both end and pull tightly\nUse one of the alligator clips to clamp the other end of the rope to prevent unraveling\nReplace the clothes pin with another alligator clip\nLay the rope flat to help prevent it from kinking up\nNote: In the gluing step you will need to wait for glue to set after each loop.

The best location for it is the back of hand since the thumb loop has extra material. Make 3 or 4 wraps of the thermostat body and glue it in place.\nThumb Loop\nThe thumb / back of hand loop will be the most difficult to apply. It will have to be glued in 2 or 3 stage because of how it wraps around the glove. Don't trim the thumb loop too short as loop temperature rapidly rises as the length decreases.

I decided for this season that I'd try to be more organized, so I decided to design and build a rack that could sit in the bed of my truck and keep things more secure. I also wanted to be able to haul more boards without worrying about them rubbing or scratching each other, or damage any of the valuable Faberge eggs or Chihuly glass sculptures which I often take with me. ;)\nThe design criteria were:\nHold at least 3 boards between the wheel wells of my full size pickup truck while leaving space for a large bin that I also need to store in the bed of the truck\nHold the boards in such a way as to not damage them\nLeave enough space between the boards to allow for bindings\nBe arranged in such a way that it is not too difficult to place or remove the boards from the rear of the truck\nRack should be easy to remove from the truck when not needed\nThe design I came up with is relatively simple and meets the design criteria, with the possible exception of placing or removing a snowboard being potentially difficult for a person with a shorter reach than myself. The overall length of the rack was determined by width of the bindings as placed on the board I have with the widest stance. This board, and therefore all of the others I currently own, will fit with both bindings between the end-plates.\nUsing the design constraints above, it became evident that there would be enough room for 4 boards if placed vertically. However, I decided I liked the idea of having the boards at an angle and I also wanted to have a place to put my skis, so I turned set the slots to 30 degrees from vertical and made the last slot wider to accommodate a pair of skis.\nI think this rack would also work in a wall mounted configuration for off-season storage and/or display.", "title": "Truck Bed Snowboard & Ski Rack", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Truck-Bed-Snowboard-Ski-Rack/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I designed the rack in Creo Parametric 3.0, and output .dxf files that I can open in Cut2D to generate the G-code I need to cut it on my home-built CNC router. There are essentially only two different parts: the slotted end-plate (x2), and the cross-bar (x3). I'm attaching .dxf files for cutting the parts by CNC, as well as .pdf files annotated with dimensions. The plywood I used (baltic birch, nominal 3/4\" thick) has an actual thickness of 0.71\", so I made the slots and tabs to account for a material thickness of 0.72\". If you're using true 3/4\" plywood you'll need to account for the discrepancy (you can always sand/file the parts until they fit). Also attached to this instructable are .dxf files sized for 0.75\" thick material. I do not recommend any kind of particle board or MDF for this project since it is likely to get wet at some point during its use.\nWith the parts drawn, laid out in such a way to optimally fill the plywood pieces I had on hand, and toolpaths generated, the cutting can begin. For this project I used a 1/4\" diameter upcut Spiral O-flute bit, which I run at 10,000 RPM and a feedrate of 100 inch/min. This cutter was used for all of the profiles of the parts, and a 90 degree V cutter was used for the lettered engraving.\nThe rounded corners in the slots are cut that way to account for the radius of the CNC router bit and make assembly easier. If you're making it by hand the corners of the slots could be squared up by hand, or one could also round over the corners of the crossbar tabs to achieve the same result. The \"DMQ\" engraving is in honor of the \"Dig My Quiver\" snowboarding Facebook group.\nThis project is also easily made without a CNC router. A jigsaw would be enough to cut out the parts (though a bandsaw would be better), and the assembly tabs/slots could be omitted and replaced with wood screws driven through the face of the end-plates into the ends of the cross-bars. The tolerances in the parts aren't super critical.

Once you're happy with the fit then you should be ready for glue. I applied wood glue to the crossbar tabs and inserted them into the end-plates, making sure that the tabs were fully inserted into the slots. You may need to use a hammer to help set the cross-bars, especially when placing the second end-plate. Use a piece of scrap wood when hammering so that you don't dent your new snowboard rack.\nAt this point I just clamped across the two end-plates while the glue dried. I thought about using screws to secure the pieces as well, but in my case everything was tight enough that I wasn't worried about the parts slipping.

I used some carpet remnants I had from a remodeling project, cut into strips and then glued into place with contact cement (following the general use instructions for contact cement). The carpet will cushion the bottom edge of the snowboards and protect the base and top sheet from scuffs. I placed the carpet strips in short segments - from the top edge, down and back up one slot, and back along the top edge halfway to the next slot. Dividing up the strips this way means you don't run into timing problems during assembly as the contact cement on each surface has to dry, but you only have enough hands to apply the cement to one surface at a time (unless you have friends that can help, then go nuts).\nI considered making the carpet strips wide enough to fold over the sides and then staple them, but decided that I'd try it with just the contact cement and see how well it holds up. You should avoid putting staples through the face of the carpet that touches the snowboard because the staples could cause damage. Contact cement is a convenient adhesive to use in this case, since a glue with a longer set time would require some custom blocks placed inside the slots to hold the carpet in place while it dries. Since you let contact cement \"dry\" before pressing the two surfaces together the adhesion is instant, though you do need to be careful when laying the strips down onto the edge of the rack so that the loose end of the strip doesn't accidentally make contact in a place where you don't want it to attach permanently.\nSince I only made the slots 1\" wide I did have to be mindful of the thickness of the carpet that I used to line the slots. Obviously if the carpet is too thick then the boards may not fit into the slots.

That's the approach I took to make this magnetic bucket broom for my small Kubota BX tractor. The basic idea was to have a tractor broom that could be attached and removed from the tractor bucket without getting off the tractor seat. First I installed a number of rare earth magnets to check the idea out. I started with four old brooms that I borrowed from an earlier broom project. I gave the prototype a real test sweeping heavy gravel on my asphalt driveway and it worked just great. That gave me the necessary incentive to go ahead with a finished unit.\nI switched from the rare earth magnets to tool holding magnetic bars. Rare earth magnets are fragile, and, more importantly, they rust quickly. The tool holding magnet bars use ceramic magnets. Ceramic magnets are very slow to rust and the sturdy steel channel that holds the magnets is well suited to the kind of heavy use they will get in this project.\nThe opening video shows the broom in operation and the steps I took to get to the final unit.

Dealing with loose regular steel screws around powerful magnets is a bit hectic so no need for that in this application.\nThe old brooms were in bad shape but they served the purpose to check out the feasibility of the magnetic broom idea.\nInstalling the broom release arms with ground contact blocks\nThe two broom release arms consist of lengths of 1/8 x 1-1/2 x 1-1/2 x 20 inch angle iron. I cut the related plastic blocks from a length of UHMW plastic that I had on hand. I decided on 2 pieces for each block and the blocks end up measuring about 4-3/4 x 3 inches with a finished thickness of about 5/8 inch. The blocks secured with 1/4 inch hex screws and locking nuts.\nInstalling the tool holding magnetic bars\nTwo #10 x 1-1/2 inch SS wood screws are required for each bar.\nThere is no particular arrangement in the layout of the magnets. But the magnets should be placed well clear of the side angle iron (broom release arms) otherwise there could be a clearance problem with the bucket sides and the magnets during and after the broom \"catch\" action.\nThe most important thing here is to leave between 1/16 and 1/8 of inch space between the bar and the wood. This allows for some wiggle room to let the magnets conform and securely attach to the tractor bucket even when the bucket bottom is not perfectly flat.\nInstalling the new brooms\nFour regular 24 inch push brooms\nThree 1/4 x 2 inch galvanized lag screws per broom.\nI drilled a 1/4 inch hole through the broom wood before securing the brooms in place. It helps to clamp the broom down while installing.\nInstalling the swivel casters and guide brackets\nBecause the casters can take a fairly high load from the bucket it's best to find heavy duty casters. The main size requirement is that the caster wheel is abut 1 inch above the ground when the broom bristles ends are touching the ground. Install them with 1-1/2 inch galvanized lag screws.\nThe two front guide brackets are heavy duty galvanized units measuring 8 x 1-1/4 inches. The steel is about 3/16 inch thick. Install them with 1-1/2 inch galvanized screws. These brackets overhang the wood edge about 3-1/4 inches.\nThe two side guide brackets are heavy duty galvanized units measuring 6 x 1-1/8 inches and are about 3/16 inch thick. Install with 1-1/2 inch galvanized lag screws.\nAt one point I laid a sheet of construction plastic over the magnets to see what affect it might have on the attraction between the magnets and the bucket.

Next, place the thread into the bobbin and thread it through the bobbin eye. Take your hook, whatever size you want, and clamp it into the vice on the curve of the hook with the barb on the bottom.

That probably seems like lots of space to them, but if I had to swerve to miss a pot hole or ironworks in the road, I'd be in trouble. 99.9% of vehicles are in fact very careful, but for those 0.1% of people who drive badly, I decided to build an overtaking sensor for my bike.\nThe overtaking sensor uses a laser time of flight distance sensor to see how far away the other vehicles are, and a camera to record the vehicle going past. I needed to record (and more importantly retrieve) the data easily, so I decided to use a Raspberry Pi Zero Wireless to manage the recording and to make the results available wirelessly.

The VL53L1X chip sends an eye safe laser beam, and measures the time it takes to get a reflection, allowing it to measure distances from 40mm to 4m. This LIDAR detection is fast, and can take measurements up to 50 times a second - ideal for recording fast moving vehicles.\nThe sensor data is captured by a Raspberry Pi, which also uses a camera to record the passing traffic. The code overlays the distance measurement on the video so that the measurements and the activity are always tied together.\nThe Raspberry Pi uses a web interface to make the files available to download for you to view afterwards.

I did this so that it was easy to test and prototype, but you can easily just solder wires directly to the raspberry pi if you prefer - just don't do it yet, because some of the raspberry pi pins are dual purpose.\nNext solder up the LED. Attach the resistor to the cathode - the side with the shorter leg and with the flat side. Then solder on female breadboard connectors to the anode and to the other end of the resistor. I added some heatshrink to go round the legs of the LED to avoid the bare wires from touching other components.\nLastly, solder up the two switches. One of the switches will be to start and stop recordings, and also to power down the device. The other will be to turn on the device. Choose your switch colours accordingly. For the switch to start and stop, just solder two female breadboard wires to it. For the turn on switch, we need something more complicated. Solder a female breadboard wire to one side.

The next step is to 3D print a nice box for it. I have a box I have designed for it. You'll find the slt files attached for you to print it. However, you probably don't want to print exactly this box for three reasons;\n1) The bottom of the box has a block the width of the gap in my pannier bars. Depending on how you want to fix it on your bike, you'll want to adjust that to your own dimensions.\n2) The hole in the side for charging the battery will need to be placed in the right place for whichever battery you buy.\n3) I live in the UK where everyone drives on the left, and I want to detect traffic on the right. If you live in a right side driving country, you will want to move the hole for the camera to the left instead of the right.

A clear plastic screen could be added in front of the camera and the distance sensor. The distance sensor will have a reflection from the plastic which will impact the reading, but you can calibrate the sensor to account for that. Search for \"VL53L1X API user manual\" for instructions for that.\nYou'd also need a stopper for the USB charging port, and add sealant round the switches.\n2) The raspberry pi doesn't have a real time clock. A battery powered RTC can be added so that the time is correct on boot. I use a wifi hotspot on my phone to allow it to connect to get the correct time instead, but an RTC unit would negate the need for that.\n3) If you want to make the video file available to windows more easily, you can install a Samba server by running \"sudo apt-get install samba samba-common-bin\" and then editing the file /etc/samba/smb.conf to add the following content at the end of the file\n[share]<br>Comment = Pi shared folder\nPath = /share\nBrowseable = yes\nWriteable = Yes\nonly guest = no\ncreate mask = 0777\ndirectory mask = 0777\nPublic = yes\nGuest ok = yes\nThen set the Samba password by typing \"sudo smbpasswd -a pi\" and then entering a password.

Now just to make the deck itself.\nMost skateboards use 7 or 8 sheets of maple vineer of 1.6 - 2 mm thick. Since I couldn't find any good maple vineer within my budget and timeframe, I went with hardwooden multiplex of 3.6 mm thick. This was the thinnest wood I could find for a reasonable price, at my local hardware store. I have used 4 sheets of this.\nThe first thing I did was test one sheet in the mold. I placed the sheet on the bottom mold, put the top mold on top and pressed. I could hear some cracks almost immediatly, the wood wasn't flexible enough for the shape of the mold. After some quick research I learned that water and heat could both make wood more flexible. So I put on the tea kettle and waited untill the water was almost boiling. Then I went back outside and poured some of the hot water on one of the sheets. I tested this sheet again in the mold and it was flexible enough.\nSo now that I have a way to get the multiplex in the mold, let's go for it. I pour the water over the first sheet and place in on the bottom mold. I squirt a whole lot of wood glue on the sheet and spread it so the glue has an even spread all over. Then comes the next sheet; water, place it in the mold, glue. And the next sheet. And the last sheet, but of course without the glue on top.\nI did make sure to alternate the sheet according to the wood grain. This wouldn't really matter for the multiplex which I used, but if you use vineer this might be important. Make sure that you place one sheet with the grain vertical and the next with the grain horizontal, vertical again and so on.\nWhen all the sheets are glued and in the mold, place the top mold on top of the sheets. I used glue clamps on each of the corners of the mold to press the two molds together. I turned them as far as I could to make sure the sheets were being properly pressed together. After an hour or so I tried tightening them even more, and after another hour again. When I couldn't tighten the clamps any further, I let it all rest for about 3 days.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FB2/6F5Z/JNIREFTB/FB26F5ZJNIREFTB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVQ/LS1I/JNIREFTE/FVQLS1IJNIREFTE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRE/VBPL/JNIREFTM/FREVBPLJNIREFTM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Making the Deck"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "After the 3 days I got the whole thing out of the shed and unscrewed the glue clamps.

I downloaded a template for the holes of the trucks and printed it and drilled the holes. I mostly placed these on sight, I didn't measure for an exact place I wanted them.\nAfter drilling the holes, the deck is basically finished. After a quick test ride, I got some spray varnish and sprayed multiple layers on all sides of the deck. When this dried I drove to my favourite skate shop, Sickboards.

It has a geometric shape with triangles passing through each other. I simplified this a bit to make it more suitable for making it myself on this deck.\nAgain, I designed this in SolidWorks. I printed it out and had to think of a way to transfer it from paper to paint. First I had to think of the colours I would use. I ended up with going for a white graphic on a black surface.\nSo I used a grey primer first. I didn't know if this would be necessary, but figured it couldn't hurt. So after a few layers of primer, I applied a few layers of matte-black paint. Now only to make the graphic.\nTo make the graphic I first marked out the corner points. I taped the printed out graphic on the deck and with a small screw, I made a little mark in the paint where all the corners are. Now just to figure out what would be the best way to apply the graphic itself. I tried multiple things, like a permanent marker and spray paint. The marker wasn't really visible and the spray paint didn't work because there was too much wind.\nSo what I did was use painters tape to mark out one single line between the marked corners. Then take some plain white acrylic paint and a small brush and draw the one line. Then repeat this for all the other lines.

Then I decided I would build a teardrop trailer, but I had to shelve that idea, too. I scaled back my ambitions, and decided to put a camper shell on my pickup instead. Even though I had to scale back my plans, I had a lot of ideas that I was able to incorporate into this project.\nMy main objective is comfort. I needed to have a comfortable place to sleep, but I also wanted a comfortable place where I could sit and read, or watch a DVD. I needed storage under the bunk and room for all my other gear, but I also needed the setup to be easy to store when not in use. I came up with a bunk that converts to a recliner. The basic concept seemed simple enough, but it took quite a bit of fiddling to get it to work.

Two pieces of half-inch plywood placed on edge support the bunk boards. The bunk support pieces are attached by hinges to a frame that lies flat on the bed of the pickup. A second set of \"notched\" supports is attached to the bunk support pieces, at right angles, so that when the bunk supports are folded down, the recliner supports swing into position. The notched support pieces allow the bunk board to form something resembling a reclining seat.\nThe basic concept seemed valid, but I wasn't sure if it would all fit together in the back of the pickup. I ended up making a model out of scraps of \u201cfoam-core\u201d material to test various configurations. Scale models are a maker\u2019s best friend because they let you to see exactly how moving parts work together. They are also a no-cost way to try different layouts to see what works.\nEven with the model, I had to noodle on the layout for quite a while before I could decide on the final dimensions. One of the downsides of the \u201cconvertible\u201d bunk is that to change the configuration you have to unload everything stored under the bunk. I wanted the space between the bed supports to be wide enough so I could use cheap plastic storage bins that I could slide out and shove under the pickup. I decided that I needed about a 16-inch wide space for these bins. Simple enough, but I also felt it was important for the vertical bunk supports to rest securely in the grooves of the pickup bed. Unfortunately, these two criteria left me with a bare 36-inches between the inside edge of the pickup bed and the outside edge of the left-most, bunk support. Since I'm using half-inch thick plywood for both the bunk and the vertical supports, this left a very thin edge for the bunk to rest on. I could have just made the bunk an inch wider, but I had already made the decision that I needed fifteen-inches between the edge of the bunk and the wheel well to fit an ice chest and cook box.\nI solved this problem by attaching a two-by-two \u201crail\u201d along the inside edge of the vertical bunk support. And I extend this two-by-two piece to meet the head frame so the bunk board wouldn't slip down into the gap when changing positions. .\nThe final design is pretty simple. There are three basic components to the recliner-bunk: the bunk board (in three sections), an undercarriage that consists of a flat frame with two sets of rotating supports attached to the frame with hinges; and a head frame that sits against the front of the pickup bed, and includes \u201cstops\u201d to set the back of the recliner in various positions. I am currently using an off-the-shelf foam pad that folds into three 24 by 36-inch sections. This works, but eventually I plan to make three separate cushions so that two can be used for the back and seat of the recliner. The handles at the end of the bunk supports will hold the three cushions in place in the bunk configuration.

In addition to the bunk-boards, I needed two pieces of plywood 9 \u00bd-inches wide for the bunk supports (the wheel wells are nine and a half-inches high), and these support pieces needed to be five feet long to provide enough support for the three-piece bunk. This meant that I couldn\u2019t just cut the three-foot wide bunk by ripping a one-foot wide strip off my sheet of half-inch plywood. Instead, I cut a three-foot wide section from one end of the plywood, and used that piece to make the head and foot parts of the bunk. The two five-foot long by nine \u00bd-inch wide bunk supports are cut out of the remaining five-foot long piece of plywood. But this left me with a piece for the back rest section of the recliner that was only 29 inches long (less saw kerfs), which was three inches shorter than I figured I needed. But it seemed like a reasonable compromise. This left me with a couple of scraps from my sheet of 1/2-inch plywood, and I used those scraps to make two arm rests and a couple of side tables (see steps X and Y).\nEven with my best-use of the sheet of half-inch plywood, I still needed more plywood to make the notched supports for the recliner. I had a four-foot by 15-inch wide piece of \u00be-inch plywood left over from another project, and I ripped this in half to make two pieces seven 3/8-inch tall for the notched-recliner support pieces. I used parts of these, and some other scraps, to make additional support pieces for the undercarriage.\nIn the bunk configuration, the bunk is moved over to the passenger side of the pickup bed, allowing room to store an ice chest, cook box and other gear beside the bunk. Because the bunk needs to slide back and forth to change configurations, I decided to attach ropes at the front corners of the bunk, and run ropes through pullies mounted on the outer edges of the head frame. The ropes make it easier to slide the bunk back and forth. when changing configurations, but I don't think they are really necessary.\nI used a 1 \u00bd-inch hole saw to make handles for moving the bunk around and for pulling up on the back support piece to change recliner positions. Several of the round cut-outs were saved for making \"rollers\" to assist with raising the bunk into the recliner position, and more were used to make pulleys to move the bunk back and forth.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F44/OYUR/JMYWSYOD/F44OYURJMYWSYOD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAE/C8CN/JMYWSYOJ/FAEC8CNJMYWSYOJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F06/Q5MR/JMYWSYOB/F06Q5MRJMYWSYOB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1B/3FPK/JMYWSYLU/F1B3FPKJMYWSYLU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWX/YEUK/JMYWSYO8/FWXYEUKJMYWSYO8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS0/LGA6/JMYWSYO9/FS0LGA6JMYWSYO9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Cutting Out the Parts:"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "As discussed previously, the bunk is in three sections. I decided to use strips of one-inch wide Nylon webbing for the hinges joining the bunk parts together. Initially, I'd planned to use epoxy to attach the webbing strips to the bunk parts, but I wasn\u2019t confident that I could get the measurements right the first time. Once again, my choice of plywood and my general stubbornness made it hard to find screws to attach the webbing strips to the half-inch plywood. I really wanted to use Number-10 screws and finishing washers (see photo for comparison of Number-8 and Number-10 screws), but I couldn\u2019t find a hardware store that carried Number-10 screws, in the half-inch length. I ended up ordering the screws and finish washers on line. I was planning to use two screws for each end of the straps, but since I had to buy in quantities of 100, I decided to put three screws in each end. Both the number of screws and number of straps for the hinges is overkill, but as I was building the bunk I got to thinking it would probably be stout enough to drive on, in an emergency (say to get out of sand or mud), so I went ahead and used an excess of screws, just in case.\nIn the recliner position, The foot of the bed becomes the seat; the middle of the bunk becomes the back-rest; and the head-board hinges down to rest on one of the four cross members in the head frame. The seat-back drops down into one of two notches in the recliner-support boards. With four back-rest positions and two seat positions there are many options for achieving the desired level of comfort. For the back-rest to slide down into the locking notches, there needs to be slack in the straps forming the hinge between the back-rest and the seat. To make te necessary slack, I clamped scraps of 3/4-inch plywood between the bunk parts before screwing the straps in place. It took me a couple of tries to get the strap arrangement right, it's easy to get confused about which side of the bunk-boards to attach which end of the strap to. Look at the picture to see how the straps go from the top of one board to the bottom of the next board.\nI didn't account for the thickness of the straps when I was measuring the bunk board.

The undercarriage is basically a flat frame made of Douglas Fir one-by-fours with one-by six cross members. Two sets of support pieces are attached at right angles, and the paired supports are attached to the frame with three hinges per support pair. The first set of support pieces (bunk supports) are half-inch plywood rectangles that extend from the tailgate to within a foot or so of the front of the pickup bed. These vertical bunk supports are attached to the frame with hinges, and the second set of support pieces (made of 3/4-inch plywood) has notches cut at the appropriate reclining angles. I tacked the two pairs of support pieces together and used clamps to test out various positions. I had previously tried several positions by propping up pieces of plywood scrap and tracing the angles. I used these angles to check for comfort with the bunk boards. I simplified things by selecting just two angles for the recliner supports. The trick to making the recliner positions work is to make sure the front of the seat has enough support that it won't lever the back-rest out of its locking notches. I made the second seat position so that the front end of notch matches the angle for front point of the first seat position. The first seat notch only supports a few inches of the rear of the seat, but the in that position, the front edge of the seat rests on the end of the second notch. Refer to the pictures for a better understanding of the relationship.\nAfter testing, I decided to angle the back part of the first notch so the recliner could be tilted back further. With the two main notches, and three back support positions, the recliner can be set at several different positions.\nThe two notched recliner supports are attached to the half-inch bunk supports with pocket screws. These make a strong joint, but there will be a lot of lateral pressure on this joint when changing positions. To add support, I cut a couple of quarter-round pieces of \u00be-inch plywood to hold the pieces at right angles. For additional support, I used an old boat-builder's tip and made 'knees' by cutting plywood rectangles into boomerang shapes. This provides good support, but also allows storage bins to be slid under the bunk.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2F/ZKS0/JMYWSYO7/F2FZKS0JMYWSYO7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK8/G6F3/JMYWSYOY/FK8G6F3JMYWSYOY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F11/3HU6/JN4VEJEK/F113HU6JN4VEJEK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFC/T7LF/JN4VEJEL/FFCT7LFJN4VEJEL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEU/6EDM/JMYWSYOH/FEU6EDMJMYWSYOH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR6/EXQ0/JMYWSYLV/FR6EXQ0JMYWSYLV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Making the Undercarriage"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The head frame is built against the front of the pickup bed and supports both the head of the bunk, and the seat back recliner positions. This frame just fits behind the tie-downs at the front of the pickup bed. There are two main cross members, and additional \"stops\" made from plywood scrap are fitted between the head frame cross members. I added some one-by-six support blocks between the cross members, and the cross member at the bottom of the head frame is drilled to fit bolts at the ends of the base frame, so the two frames can be attached with wing nuts.\nAfter the first test, I realized that the head section of the bunk needed to be lifted up during the switch, to allow the bunk to be placed in the recliner position. I had some long (14-inch) narrow scraps of 3/4-inch plywood and I attached \"rollers\" made from the hole cutouts to make these. The rollers are attached to the ends of these pieces with quarter-inch lag bolts and washers. The roller assembly is attached to the quarter-round support sections at the front of the undercarriage. I experimented a bit to find the best position for the roller assemblies. the rollers lift the head section of the bunk board, but this board needs to be held down at the front, to make the rollers lift the back-rest into position. To make better use of the bunk, I used the jigsaw to cut a section about an inch-and-a half wide out of the top board of the head frame. This narrow piece of scrap is attached to the head frame uprights to hold down on the head board from lifting, while the bunk board is being raised into the recliner position.\nI drilled 1 1/2-inch holes in the sides of the head frame, just above the bunk support cross member.

I knocked the pins out of two more hinges and found \u201chairpins\u201d at the hardware store to substitute for the hinge pins.

I bought a relatively inexpensive portable DVD player, but I needed a shelf to put it on. Things are pretty cramped in the camper, so I wanted to attach the DVD shelf to the ceiling. The camper came with two rows of hooks in the ceiling, but I was worried that if I attached the shelf to the hooks at the back, it would be in the way when I was getting in and out of the camper. But the shelf needs to be near the back of the camper to watch a movie while sitting in the recliner. The solution was to mount a double-set of rails along the side of each row of hooks; and have the shelf slide forward and backward on the lower set of rails.\nI found these inexpensive ($4 each) 3/4-inch diameter aluminum tubes at an industrial supply store, and used zip-ties to attach one set of these \"rails\" to the outside edge of each row of hooks. A second set of rails is attached to the first set, with blocks that have holes drilled through them. The wooden blocks keep the rails at the right spacing, and allow the DVD shelf to slide forward and back on loosely mounted zip-ties. Because the rails are only attached at the ends, the shelf can slide nearly the full length of the camper shell.\nThe shelf is made from 1/4-inch Baltic Birch plywood, and reinforced with pieces of one-by-two trim. I left about an inch of plywood extending beyond the frame at the front and back edges to provide a place to clamp things (lights, fans, etc). I cut a rectangular \"door\" in this shelf, sized to fit the DVD player, and the player is attached to this door, so that when the door is opened downward, the DVD player (with the screen flipped around) faces toward the front of the pickup.\nThe drop-down door, and the edges of the opening are framed with one-by-two trim, which provide good mounting points for the hidden hinges. A piece of one-by-four trim is attached to the back side to make it easier to mount the hinges.\nI've used these hinges before, but I had forgotten that they only work for 3/4-inch trim. Because I used quarter-inch plywood, in addition to the 3/4-inch trim, the hinges didn't fit right. If I had it to do over again, I would have chiseled out places for the hinges, but instead I just sanded part of the plywood piece to make room for the door to open to 90-degrees. The hidden hinges won't hold the door closed by themselves, at least not on bouncy roads, so I added a simple bolt that just slides through a hole in the frame, and into another hole in the DVD door. This is kept in place with a springy piece of old rake tine. I don't care much for this arrangement, and I intend to find something that looks better, but it works for now. I may put some padding under the DVD player in the future, but it seems to work okay.\nI added a small boxed-in area at the front edge of the shelf (about six-inches wide). This extra shelf space provides a place for a Bluetooth speaker, DVDs, and other odds and ends. I store a number of devices and things that need power on this shelf, so I picked up a 12-Volt extension cord and an outlet multiplier that I mounted on the shelf. In addition to playing DVDs, this particular DVD player will, supposedly, pick up local broadcast TV stations. I\u2019m optimistic, but not expecting much at the $79 price for this unit.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1J/4PE9/JN4VEHXS/F1J4PE9JN4VEHXS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4H/WVGR/JN4VEHXR/F4HWVGRJN4VEHXR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F33/QVOH/JN28OGYY/F33QVOHJN28OGYY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5O/DE0C/JN28OGYU/F5ODE0CJN28OGYU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4D/OAG2/JN28OGYT/F4DOAG2JN28OGYT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX7/J0FC/JN28OGYR/FX7J0FCJN28OGYR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSY/KSIQ/JN28OGYL/FSYKSIQJN28OGYL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFQ/Z550/JN28OGYW/FFQZ550JN28OGYW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDY/HV5U/JN4VEBFR/FDYHV5UJN4VEBFR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC4/FT9N/JN4VEB7L/FC4FT9NJN4VEB7L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F53/V492/JN4VEB7K/F53V492JN4VEB7K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI0/5UZ3/JN4VEB7H/FI05UZ3JN4VEB7H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVW/A0QT/JN4VEB7F/FVWA0QTJN4VEB7F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCF/OW1R/JN4VEB7G/FCFOW1RJN4VEB7G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4L/QMHA/JN4VEB7D/F4LQMHAJN4VEB7D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHI/XN9B/JN4VEBJO/FHIXN9BJN4VEBJO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Entertainment Center"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "I had a couple of pieces of half-inch material left over from the bunk, and I used these to make a couple of side tables that \u201clock\u201d into the tracks that run along the inside edge of the pickup bed. I made a mock-up of the anchoring assembly using a scrap piece of 1/2-inch plywood and a paint stirring stick. I used a utility knife to cut a quarter-inch wide strip off of one side of the paint stirring stick and glued this to the upper edge of the table. I rounded the bottom edge of the plywood below the quarter-inch strip of paint stirring stick, so the edge of the table can rotate into the track. The remaining piece of paint stirring stick is glued to the underside of the table edge, about a half-inch in from the edge. A little bit of sanding was necessary, particularly to paint stirring stick on the underside, to get the test piece to rotate into position and lock in place.\nWhen I was satisfied with the test piece, I scaled it up for a small (eight-inch wide) table/shelf, and even though the table was fairly secure, it still needed a leg to support the front edge. For the leg, I used another paint stirring stick to make a \u201ccleat\u201d near the outside edge of the table, and cut a third paint stirring stick to jam between this cleat and the top of the wheel well. The leg is secured to the underside of the table with hook-and-loop material. I did the same thing with a larger, 14-inch wide table, and used the larger size of paint stick for the cleat and leg. It took a bit of sanding to get the fit right, but the tables can be set up at various positions along the track. The larger table has a second leg for mounting to the pickup bed, instead of the wheel well. When not being used as a table, the larger table also serves as a drawing board for future projects.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCT/W7OP/JMYWSYOG/FCTW7OPJMYWSYOG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F14/F1TN/JMYWSYP0/F14F1TNJMYWSYP0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBA/6Q8C/JMYWSYOW/FBA6Q8CJMYWSYOW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVC/9FMO/JMYWSYOA/FVC9FMOJMYWSYOA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV8/K6NV/JMYWSYM0/FV8K6NVJMYWSYM0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXS/ALQV/JMYWSYM1/FXSALQVJMYWSYM1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGZ/TRDS/JMYWSYOK/FGZTRDSJMYWSYOK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKN/BZCX/JMYWSYOV/FKNBZCXJMYWSYOV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNX/GRIN/JMYWSYOX/FNXGRINJMYWSYOX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Side Tables"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Mattress cushions\nA good mattress was a priority, so I bought a twin-size, high-density foam mattress, four inches thick, and topped that with a two-inch layer of latex foam rubber. I cut the foam pieces to make three cushions, 23 1/2-inches by 31-inches, and glued the latex pieces to the foam pieces with aerosol adhesive. I found some pretty inexpensive upholstery material at a fabric store, and bought bulk zippers on line that were cut to fit. The cushion covers are just simple box construction, with a zipper along the long seam.\nCurtain Loops/magnets\nI cut slits in the interior carpeting at the upper and lower corners of the camper and epoxied loops of rope behind the carpet to attach para-cord strings for curtains to slide on.\nBlackout curtains\nI bought this blackout fabric on line and sewed curtains for the camper. This fabric is too thick to just sew a sleeve to string the para-cord through, so I sewed button holes (top and bottom) every few inches. The rear curtain doesn\u2019t have button holes along the bottom, it just hangs. I found that I kept sitting on these rear curtains, so I strung them on an elastic cord to prevent damage. On bright moon-lit nights, or when I have to park near street lights, it sure is nice to have the ability to make it dark inside.\nCeiling Tracks\nInstalling these likely voids the camper warranty, but I felt that I needed them. I just took the screws out of the luggage rack tracks, and bought longer screws to have sufficient length to attach the tracks. Only one of the pre-drilled holes lined up, so I had to drill mostly new holes in the tracks.\nGrab Bars\nI found some fire-sprinkler pipe hangers that I used to mount 1 1/4-inch diameter, stainless steel closet rails to the tracks. I feel like the grab bars are pretty sturdy, but I try not to put my full weight on the bars when I grab them.\nI had modified a set of steps that I originally built for my dog to climb up onto the tailgate. I re-cut these steps so they would slide in under the bunk. After falling off the stairs one night, I got rid of them and am happy to have the extra storage. Now I get into the camper by sitting on the tailgate and using the rear grab bar with my feet on the tailgate to pull myself inside.\nSquare lumber bars\nOnce the grab bars were in place, I had a convenient place to attach more cross members that I attached other things (fans, lights, bookshelf) to. I found three-quarter-inch square trim pieces four feet long, and attached them to the grab bars with zip-ties. Since the grab bars are pretty slick, I put a wrap of gorilla tape around the ends to give the zip-ties something to grab onto.\nFans\nI have a number of USB powered fans in the camper. One is a seven-inch, square box fan that fits fairly neatly in the pass-through window. I have in set up to work like a whole house fan, pulling air in through the back and blowing it out through the cab. Other fans clamp to the cross members or are just hand-held to cool my head.\nBook shelf\nI made this so I could have a place to put some reference books and maps, but it\u2019s become a catch-all for everything I can\u2019t find a place to set down. I tacked a length of round pipe wrap insulation to the back of the shelf so it wouldn\u2019t bang on the window. I bought a bunch of cheap little steel hangers and used a torch to heat them up so I could flatten one end of the hanger and put a twist in it so the shelf could be hung from it\u2019s center of gravity. I have a few extra of these over-the-door hooks that I use here and there to attach what-not pouches to the cross bars.\nMosquito net\nHere\u2019s where some of the magnets I glued in with the curtain anchor loops come in. The mosquito net attaches to the rear hatch with a loop around each of the door handles. The loops of elastic cord are threaded through a sleeve that runs along the middle section of the top of the mosquito net. From there, the mosquito net has little magnets sewn in to match up with the magnets glued to the inside of the camper. I added some interior magnets near the corners of the upper door hinge, so the mosquito net can be mounted to cover the entire gap in the door. The net is divided in the middle for access, and I added some weighted string that I got at the fabric store to the bottom of the mosquito net to make it hang better.\nPrivacy curtain\nI bought a set of springy, aluminum tent poles and drilled holes near the ends of the luggage rack cross bar, so I could mount the tent pole in a big hoop behind the camper. I robbed a few pieces from the extra tent pole, to allow enough room within the hoop, so I could open and close the hatch without catching. The remaining pole pieces were used to make up a short, vertical pole to support the big hoop in the middle. I made a really simple connector piece to attach the upright pole to the hoop by just drilling holes in the ends of a two-inch strip of thin aluminum stock, and twisting the piece so that the holes face 90 degrees apart. One hole is large enough to slide over the tent pole, and the second hole is just large enough to fit the tip of the vertical tent pole.\nFor the curtain, I just bought pre-made shower curtains (it took three to go all the way around), and hung the curtains from the pole using cheap little mini-carabiners instead of shower curtain hooks. These curtains have a nice woodland scene, and they were on sale. I sewed pairs of little magnets at various locations along the side seams of the three curtains so they will remain closed. I also added a double length of weighted string to the bottom of each curtain, and I expect I\u2019ll need to add more weights later. The little pole may not be strong enough to support the curtains, but I have some other poles that are sturdy, in case this little pole fails.\nGate Pull-straps\nOnce you\u2019re inside the camper, it\u2019s kind of difficult to reach the hatch and tailgate to close them. I attached a stirp of nylon webbing between two of the screws at the edge of the tailgate to make a handle. I have another length of the nylon webbing that has loops for carabiners that attach to this handle, so I can pull the tailgate closed. I even added a spring-clip, attached to another strap to release the tailgate latch. This needed something to make the strap pull outward on the handle, so I just taped a round plastic container to the pull strap, to give it a way to pull the latch outward.\nFor the upper hatch, I made a long strap to fit between the latches (on the inside) and attached it by putting grommets in the strap and bought some steel carabiners to mount the strap behind the door latches. This big loop makes a convenient handle, and I have another strap, with carabiners, that attaches to this big loop. While I was making straps, I decided that I didn\u2019t like the way the door clanged open, so I made up a set of short straps that limit how wide the door can open. I have grommets in a couple of positions on this strap, so I can have a couple of open positions. When pushing the hatch open, you can use your foot on the strap to make the hatch open more slowly.\nPocket table\nI had made this little side table, but it wasn\u2019t very useful; so, I cut out the center of the table and stapled a canvas pouch to the underside of the table. I already had a big lap board made from quarter-inch thick plywood, so I\u2019m using this lap-board as a cover. This pouch makes a good place for all the little things I like to have handy, and it still works as a side table. I also revised the legs, making an \u201cH\u201d arrangement with paint stirring sticks. The legs sit far enough back that they don\u2019t interfere with sliding things in along side.\nSun Shade\nThere is nothing particularly original about hanging a tarp from the back end of the vehicle. I did make up a set of one-piece poles made from half-inch diameter fiberglass rods. For the end of the tarp that attaches to the pickup. I bought some copper ferrules with holes in the ends (designed for battery terminals) that slide onto the half-inch fiberglass poles, and epoxied them in place. The pole can be slid in behind the luggage rack mounts, or slid through the gaps in my roof basket. The end holes are about six feet apart, so a six-foot wide tarp can be hung from the pole ends with string loops or carabiners.\nThe fiber glass poles came in a set of four, so I made up some caps with pins glued to the ends of a couple of these poles. The pins fit through the grommets in the corners of the tarp, and the tarp is anchored with guy wires and tent stakes. Since I had now used three of the four fiberglass poles, I made up a second pole with the ferrules that had holes in them. I can use the two poles with end holes to attach to my luggage rack at one end, and attach a single carabiner to the other ends of the two poles, making a fairly secure place to hang a gallon camp shower. It also works for adding a second tarp extending out to the side of the camper. All four of these six-foot poles slide in under the right-hand side of the bunk.\nWiring\nThis camper came with a bank of three, 12-volt outlets, that are wired directly to the car battery. I bought a variety of 12-volt USB charge converters, and a ten-foot long USB extension cord. This extension cord happened to fit inside the aluminum tubing that I used for rails that run along the ceiling of the camper. I used some pieces of plastic tubing, heated to expand one end a bit, and slid them in the ends of the aluminum tube I ran the wire through, so the wire wouldn\u2019t chafe. At the other end of the extension cord I mounted a USB outlet multiplier to the overhead with Velcro. I have a number of lights and fans that plug into these USB outlets.\nLocking bars\nIt always bothered me that somebody could open the camper while I was sleeping inside. The latches that hold the camper hatch closed are essentially \u201cT\u201d handles that extend through the door with an \u201cL\u201d piece on the inside that rotates to engage the door frame. I cut some pieces of aluminum flat bar (eighth inch thick, by an inch wide) about six inches long. These little bars sit on top of the \u201cT\u201d handle shaft, behind the little \u201cL\u201d pieces, and extend across to the door frame. With one of these little bars sitting on each locking mechanism. There is no way anyone outside can open the door, even if they turn the handles. I drilled holes in these little locking bars and attached them together with a piece of elastic so I can pull them out easily if I\u2019m in a hurry to get outside.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWK/H04F/JTT5HTM3/FWKH04FJTT5HTM3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG3/LNHF/JTT5HT4O/FG3LNHFJTT5HT4O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3Y/Q7AH/JTT5HT5N/F3YQ7AHJTT5HT5N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRA/A8LU/JTT5HTFS/FRAA8LUJTT5HTFS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM2/4ZYA/JTT5HTHK/FM24ZYAJTT5HTHK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM5/PHRF/JTT5HT9U/FM5PHRFJTT5HT9U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ4/JOI7/JTT5HTDU/FJ4JOI7JTT5HTDU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNP/U2ZC/JTT5HTGO/FNPU2ZCJTT5HTGO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRV/USZ5/JTT5HTES/FRVUSZ5JTT5HTES.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOI/RQGX/JTT5HTK9/FOIRQGXJTT5HTK9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOF/WENM/JTT5HTKA/FOFWENMJTT5HTKA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW0/4JQI/JTT5HTL7/FW04JQIJTT5HTL7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5Q/EE9L/JTT5HTOR/F5QEE9LJTT5HTOR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO0/N1HS/JTT5HTMZ/FO0N1HSJTT5HTMZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ1/MOPB/JTT5HTVZ/FJ1MOPBJTT5HTVZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLD/BZCK/JTT5HTIG/FLDBZCKJTT5HTIG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV6/NA2Y/JTT5HTWV/FV6NA2YJTT5HTWV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Updates"}], "channel": "Camping"}, {"category": "Outside", "description": "I'd love to say that this idea just came to me, but it was really forced to come to me.

It clears the height of the wheel wells and also doesn't interfere with the Toyota bed track system. (My girlfriend was very happy with this since it meant we would be able to pack Itso storage cubes that convert into shelves. Those are 14.75 inch cubes.)\nAccessibility? Easy. Add hatches.\nI took to building this in three sections. (Wheel wells would get in the way of trying to slide a solid 73.88\" x 56.25\" x 16\" platform in and out of the truck. This made moving in MUCH easier!)\nThe first section, closest to the cab and in front of the wheel wells, was going to act as a chest. It would have a frame around the top to keep the studs in line and a lid that sat snug within the frame.\nThe second section sat between the wheel wells.

The way to make this possible is with a framework of studs that use as few studs as possible while keeping in mind that the frame needs to be sturdy. I maintained the sturdiness by alternating the orientation of the studs systematically.

You can use this piece to make the frame and the lid. Just be careful about cutting your 3/4\" strips.) Drill the studs into the 1/4\" ply following the orientation on the included image. Make sure all the studs are right up against the edge and/or exactly in the corners of the plywood. Drill the 3/4\" plywood frame into the outer edge of the top of the studs.

Additionally, the studs would have to remain stable in place somehow. The framework I made for the chest was not going to be sufficient for this heavily load-bearing section. This is what I came up with:\nI took the total bed area allotted for this middle section for the wheel wells and split it down the middle into left and right. These would be the hatches that would swing on a fulcrum on the underside.\nBut you have to set up your studs and supports first. Again, keeping free flowing and alternating framework in mind, set up your studs and drill them into the 1/4\" ply. I recessed the studs on the side 4 inches (on center) toward the midline of the section. (Doing this gave a little more aid on the fulcrum when opening the hatch.) For the remainder of the studs, again keep in mind that they need to sit right up against the edges of the 1/4\" ply. The stud that sits in the middle of the ply should be set on center, length and width. Once the studs are screwed into place, you can screw in the braces. On the front and back, I used flat metal braces. (Wood would take up more space than a flat metal brace.) In the middle, I used a right angle brace. This helped keep the studs aligned and gave the hatch doors a little extra something to rest on. On the sides, I used wood to stabilize the studs since I had room to spare from clearance over the wheel wells. This allowed the hinges to drill in nicely.

Cal, with some light off-road towing to boot. With that said, the design is slightly top heavy, although not as much as you might think, and care should be taken when negotiating tight curves, towing in very heavy winds, or if swaying becomes an issue, although repositioning of the axle should eliminate that.

So this is a double-sided double-edged weapon from India and the first time I saw this in the forged in fire TV series. So you can say that this build is completely inspired by forged in fire. I am also a huge fan of Alec Stele who is best weapon maker on YouTube and I think most of you know him. A few months ago he builds Amores Chris Dagger. some of the inspiration is also taken from that dagger as well. I saw haladie half a year ago and as soon as I saw this weapon I fell in love with this and decided to make my own. But I definitely don't want it to look simple. Initially, my plan was to make this with father Damascus bars but unfortunately my parcel stuck in the customs office and due to that, I decided to build it with D3 high carbon high chromium Steel. I have some projects in my mind with the mosaic pins that's why I decided why not to make a handle with mosaic pins. So in this build your also going to see how to make mosaic slab as well and there are plenty of areas or projects where you can use these mosaic pins or slabs. Plenty of projects are still wondering in my mind and hoping that in future I show you them as well but for now I am going to show you the dagger build. Since this slab is my first attempt and I think I was not able to make it perfect as I needed and I came to know these mistake once the resin has been queued and I looked from both side after sending all the sides. Throughout the journey, I also tell you the perfect way to make the slab. As far as a blade is concerned I am quite happy with the result but I think if you have belt Sander then it's good to get a distilled taper onto the dagger. I tried that result with my angle grinder and files but not able to achieve that thing which I need it. Reason, why I'm posting this on the last date, is only because of the delay in the Damascus material which I ordered and I start this build 10 days before the final date and as the work started the time elapsed so fast that it came to the last date but I am happy that I am able to post this instructable. In the weapon line, this is my dream weapon and I am happy with the result and hope that in my upcoming weapon builds this experience plays the most important role in building them. Many of you are thinking that why I did not make it by forging process even I have a coal forge. although I have coal forge but I don't have a place to do the hammer work because it situated on to the top floor of my house and it's not ideal to hammer on to the roof because it may cause cracks or some other problem in the roof slab. So that's the reason why I didn't do the forging process I think in the future if I get the proper space then I definitely prefer the forging method as it's quite faster than the filing Jig when it's come to the beveling process. In last 3 days, I worked 17 hours a day which is a huge Nightmare for me because my right hand start cramped but I have the dedication for this build and only because of that I am able to complete this project in the required time.\nThere are many ups and downs came through this build but I faced each problem and able to finish this and the end result is in front of you. If you like this build and have some suggestions for me then definitely put them in the comment section down below I am extremely happy to read your feedback and reply you back.", "title": "Haladie Dagger-Ancient Weapon", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Haladie-Dagger-Ancient-Weapon/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Material and tool used\nFollowing are the list of material and tool used to make this build.\nMaterial for the knife handle\n1. brass tube\n2. copper tube\n3. brazing rod\n4.

This steel is high carbon and high chromium steel and generally used for making tools as it has more durable and holds up the edge very nicely. Initially, it's quite difficult to work with this material due to the carbon content but I think if you normalized the steel before the filling work for beveling the edge. You definitely get a lot of help after normalizing the steel. For the guard of the dagger I used brass and this is the thing which I love most than any other thing.\nTools used:-\nAs there are a bunch of ways to do any work and you are free to use whatever tools you want and one works better for you. you can proceed with that.

The only info I get about this knife is that its a double sided double-edged weapon which is mostly used for slicing and stabbing purpose and in India this weapon is used by Rajput Clans. I found some of the daggers having three knives but I decided to go with two. The main thing in the design is that all of them have a recurve.

I made brass guard which prevents that action and keep the handler safe. For that, I use 1 inch thick piece of brass and then coloured the area so that marking could be easily seen. I cut down two pieces 1\u201dX 3\u201d. I cut them with the help of angle grinder. I use many other tools as well during this process but none of them work well. The only tool work good in that case is the angle grinder. Then I clamped 80 grit sanding belt onto granite slab and start the sanding process of those brass guards. Then I mark the area from where tang has to be passed. I draw that shape and then drilled out some holes to made a path for my files to enter into the balusters. After 2 days of work I am able to enters the tang into the brass pieces. To make the basic shape of the guards I made template onto the cad and use them as a reference to draw the outlines. Before proceeding to the further step I decided to drill holes first because once it get round shape it's very difficult to get the centre and drill holes for the pins.

Although I am thinking about it for a long time but know when I get a chance I decided to give it a go. For the more detail process, you may also see my Instructables onto mosaic pins the procedure is almost the same. It changes when you have to make the complex shapes. After cutting down all the material I made the centre portion of the handle and glued the pins around it with the help of CA glue and then proceed further. Then I made a curve shape with the help of laminate and start placing the pins onto that laminate piece and then a small drop of glue used to hold the temporarily to its place. Then I made a box shape and place all of those pieces into that and then make an eye shape which I planned to make. Then I mix two-part epoxy resin and add a glow in dark pigment powder in it. Once the resin cured I make it square to each face by hand sanding and my handle piece is ready to rock. While making slab with pins always make sure that pins are cut down cleanly to avoid any misalignment. Always clean the pipes with acetone to decrease them so that they make a good bond with the resin or epoxy. Don't use too much CA glue while initial setting the pins. Take your time as much as you can to do it without the ca glue. While making slabs always make sure not to use that much pins in the slab if you are going to make knife handle with it. It has a lack of strength and difficult to work on. If you are grinding the slab to make sure to use plenty of water to avoid any mishappenings.\nmosaic pins instructable\nhttps://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Mosaic-Pins-for-Knife-Handles/", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSW/I7Q9/JMQKY6PJ/FSWI7Q9JMQKY6PJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBN/N7LG/JMQKY9YB/FBNN7LGJMQKY9YB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTH/NZ9Y/JMQKY9YA/FTHNZ9YJMQKY9YA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5I/NFQO/JMQKY9YO/F5INFQOJMQKY9YO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8D/U07P/JMQKY6PK/F8DU07PJMQKY6PK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBA/ARUU/JMQKY6PL/FBAARUUJMQKY6PL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB3/QRYR/JMQKY6PM/FB3QRYRJMQKY6PM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F84/X0ZB/JMQKY6PN/F84X0ZBJMQKY6PN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR9/5DJG/JMQKY6PO/FR95DJGJMQKY6PO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSY/ITBS/JMQKY6PP/FSYITBSJMQKY6PP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXL/O2KQ/JMQKY9YH/FXLO2KQJMQKY9YH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHT/ZXO3/JMQKY9YK/FHTZXO3JMQKY9YK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6J/W13P/JMQKY9Y9/F6JW13PJMQKY9Y9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEC/XNXJ/JMQKY6PQ/FECXNXJJMQKY6PQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 12: Mosaic Slab for the Handle"}, {"step": 13, "steps_text": "Since I am making hidden tang so these blades joined together with the help of this handle piece but before, that I have to made a cavity in them so that tang would be able to fit into these handles.

The house wrap is 3' wide by 100' long so I was able to just wrap the shed all around with 3 long pieces. Each 3' wide piece is placed from the bottom up with 6\" overlap. Once everything was nailed properly in place, I taped the overlap seams with Tyvek tape to prevent moisture and wind flow to get through.\nI haven't yet chosen the siding I want to install so this house wrap will be a good protection during the coming rainy days.\n(pictures to come ...

So long as you are careful not puncturing it, it will be leak proof for the next 50 years.\nI ordered mine (20'x 15' and a 5 gallon bucket of water based glue) from Lottes Roofing available either on Amazon or eBay.\nIt got delivered through UPS and I enlisted the help of my brother to carry the 70 lbs package up on the roof. Then we laid it flat in place for a week on the roof in order to flatten it and remove the creases.\nI then proceeded to fold half of the EPDM membrane on one side of the roof and used the broom to clean both the roof and the EPDM membrane from debris. I also used a blower to help with this process.\nI then proceeded to cover a 1/4 of the roof with the slime looking glue. It is suggested to put 1/8\" thick of glue with a trowel although I used a cheap paint roller and it worked perfectly. Don't cover the whole roof with glue at once since you need to move around and be able to pull the EPDM membrane. And you don't want the glue to dry to soon either.\nPull the EPDM membrane over the glue, making sure the glued side is clean then use the broom from the center to push all air bubbles out. Finish with a roller to make sure it stick properly then keep going until the whole roof is done.\nDepending on the finish you are looking for, the next step may vary. I chose to glue the EPDM on the front, left and right sides of the roof line to protect the wood.Those three sides will be ultimately covered with a galvanized black fascia profile.\nThe back side is glued on a galvanized drop edge (that is nailed on the roof) then covered by a black T style edge flashing (screwed all the way in). It sandwiches the EPDM membrane between two pieces of flashing: the galvanized one prevents the water from reaching the roof's plywood; the T style one prevents the wind and time from pealing the EPDM membrane from the edge of the roof.\nIf water ever gets under the T style flashing, it will run against the EPDM membrane until it reaches the galvanized flashing which itself drips into a gutter.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FS7/SXFK/JMQKYNLF/FS7SXFKJMQKYNLF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLI/TSJE/JMQKYNO0/FLITSJEJMQKYNO0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI8/2IMA/JMQKYNM4/FI82IMAJMQKYNM4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5Z/GPIE/JMQKYNMP/F5ZGPIEJMQKYNMP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: EPDM Roofing"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "After inspecting the windows I received, it turns out they are all scratched, pushed in and pieces are missing (handles, keys, screws, etc.)\nI'm getting a bit the run around between HomeDepot, Jeld-Wen and the delivery company.

At well over 50-something, I picked up a Ryobi starter kit which had a small saw and drill and a rough sketch of what I wanted to build on limited space in my backyard. With those and a limited budget, but a Habitat Re-Store nearby, I started my build. Seemed easy enough. One old timer said \"nothing to it\", you just take 1 board at a time - so get going.\nThis will not cover every step but the photos do show the progress and most of the relevant intermediate steps. Certainly not a solo effort as the pics show. I had the fantastic help of my 80yo mother who helped 'build' me. She would drive over 60 miles one way to help out with whatever we were doing (no tickets or accidents). This is as much a tribute to her as it is a how-to of what's possible with no skills and plenty of determination. I hope you enjoy and find it useful and inspirational.\nMATERIALS and Such\nI used recycled and reclaimed products whenever I could so there is no exact materials list. The few new items along with the Ryobi from Home Depot were: 5 foundation blocks, pressure-treated floor rims and joists, Styrofoam insulation, Ondura roofing panels, and lots and lots of deck screws. Nothing visible was 'new' and not a single nail.\nFrom the Re-Store: everything else. Tongue and grove sub-flooring, original real oak laminate leftovers, yards of 100 year old oak flooring with the tongues ripped off for the exterior siding, reclaimed wood and glass door, 2 small awning windows, 1 large 48\" casement window, 1 smaller 36\" casement (both turned sideways), 4 maple panel closet doors for desk and storage, 2 solid oak cabinets from a Wright State University chemistry lab redo, and enough leftover ZIP panels and miscellaneous plywood sheathing. The rolls of tar paper and insulating rock-wool were generously donated by friends. All of the framing was done with true 2\"x4\" lumber from a deconstructed house in Dayton (there are plenty more).\nOnce built, Mom furnished a nice office chair and solar desk light from IKEA in Mason.\nWith that, let's get started!", "title": "Back Yard Office", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Back-Yard-Office/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The sketch shows a mammoth 96\"x 80\" plan for a total of 7,680 square inches (or an 8'x 6'8\" footprint, 53 sq ft for the metric impaired like me) just massive!\nUsing true 2\"x4\" from the Re-Store adds over 25% to the more common graded lumber.

Kerosene is flammable but not as flammable as gasoline. Don't use gasoline. Ever. Period. I wear skin protection (gloves) and I wear eye protection (goggles). Because this uses volatile organic compounds (VOC) do this OUTSIDE or at least with really good ventilation and consider using a respirator that filters VOC's if you even think that the ventilation is inadequate.\nCleaning your chain makes your bike work better, look better and it prolongs the life of the chain and gears. All that grit acts like sandpaper wearing your expensive components down. I used to use a disposable citrus cleaner and an expensive Teflon chain lube. One day when I was lubing my chainsaw I thought that if it works on my chainsaw which is spinning at hundreds of RPM it can work for my bicycle. Then I thought of how I clean my chainsaw with a rag soaked in kerosene and voila, I arrived at my present chain cleaning method. I love this method. It's cheap. It's quick. It has worked for months at this point. Over time I created the kerosene recycling stand which you will see in STEP 2. Although optional, it's really been helpful. Chainsaw bar and chain oil has additives that help it stick to the chain and that has kept my chain lubricated thru wet rides and long rides. The bike changes gears better and I just feel better having taken care of my ride.\nThe one downside is that your bike will smell like a chainsaw. It's not overpowering but it is what it is. I personally like that smell.\nI learned early in the process that the kerosene is essentially immortal. I was going to recycle the kerosene but saw after a day that the dirt had settled to the bottom of the bottle so I experimented with pouring it to another bottle and reusing it and after 3 months I'm still using the same 12-ounce bottle of kerosene. I think I lose about 1/2 once per cleaning with the rest recycled.\nI do this after every 10 rides or sooner if needed.

I really enjoy this way of cruising around and building E-SK8's has become an addiction to me.\nI still love the looks of boosted board but they are just way to expensive for me.\nBefore I start I will explain some of my goals:\nFirst of all, I wanted to make an Electric longboard as thin as possible, again in this build I used separate Lipo cells and made a very thin battery pack (18mm) so people won't see it from the side that it's an Electric longboard.\nThe second thing is the power, I would like a longboard with a power around 1500W, The motor can handle around 2000W but I use a 10S esc which will limit the current and output around 1500W max.\nIf we talk about speed, I theoretically calculated the board at about 32km/h so I would practically guess about 30km/h. And in reality I have tested it on the smoothest road in our town and I can hit this 30km/h max speed so that's perfect. My plan was to upgrade the motorpulley later for a higer topspeed because mostly I like speeds around 40km/h but because this board is much shorter I thought let's start with 30km/h.\nThe battery with 185Wh will give me a 16km ride.\nI made the deck by myself and it was actually not that hard to make.\nAll the electronics are hidden into the deck to give it a clean look.\nIn total I have spent like 450\u20ac for every single part.\nI think you know enough information to start the explanation how I made my Electric longboard.", "title": "Powerful 1500W Electric Longboard", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Powerful-1500W-Electric-Longboard/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "What do we need?\nKeda - 190KV Motor:Hobbyking\nThis motor will fit perfectly on the hobbyking motor mount and will without sensors so perfect for the esc I mentioned below.\nI used another motor (Turnigy D5035-125KV) but don't use this turnigy motor in combination with the speed controller I mentioned in this instructable. the motor is made to rus with sensors and the esc don't support this.

If you don\u2019t have a jointer or planer, you could just buy pre-milled stock and skip this step.\nIpe is also expensive, the wood for this table was about $500, so if you wanted to keep the costs down, you could use pressure treated 4x4s and stain them to get a similar look.\nAfter getting all of the boards milled square, I laid them out on my assembly table and added the washers between each board to give me an idea of the final look. It\u2019s important to have gaps like this in outdoor table tops, so that water can drain through.

I then flipped the board and continued drilling the hole from the other side of the board until the two holes met. Drilling the holes from both sides in this way leaves you with a much cleaner hole, but you need to be pretty precise with your hole location layout, hence the jig.\nI just continued drilling holes until I had all of them done, which took a long time. It was 33 holes in total, which might not sound like a lot, but Ipe is pretty tough to drill through and I made sure to take my time so I didn\u2019t overheat my Forstner bit.

I also got some tearout during this step that I could have avoided with a less intense edge profile.\nThe tearout was especially bad on the ends of the boards, and I should have added a backer piece to help reduce this, but I didn\u2019t since I was rushing a little bit.\nSpeaking of sanding, next I had a lot of sanding to do. I started with 80 grit sandpaper, using the random orbit sander on the flat surfaces and the ends of all of the boards, but I had to hand sand all of the long edges since the random orbit sander didn\u2019t work well on those edges.\nAfter sanding, I could get the finish applied. I used Teak Oil, which is designed to work with these kinds of dense hardwoods, and it was extremely simple to apply. Basically, you put on a heavy coat, let the wood soak it up for 10 minutes, apply another heavy coat, let that soak in for about 20 minutes, and then wipe off the excess.\nIt\u2019s important to wipe off the excess before letting it sit too long, since the finish will get gummy and extremely difficult to wipe off otherwise.

This removes any burr left from the drilling process, but also allows the head of the screws to sit flush with the surface of the base.\nTo prep for paint, I used a Clean and Strip disc to remove any of the mill scale and surface rust from the steel. I got caught in a rain storm on the way home from the steel yard when I went to purchase this stuff, so it had a little bit of surface rust that needed to be removed.\nAfter stripping the rust, I wiped down the entire base with acetone before adding a few coats of flat black enamel paint.\nTo help protect my patio from the steel legs and also keep the steel from being in contact with water, I added these plastic caps to each of the feet.

More than anything else you can do, it makes using your telescope easy. Your telescope lives in the observatory, completely set-up and calibrated. You can pop open the observatory and observe the Moon for 10 minutes before the kids go to bed just as easily as you can spend an entire Friday night observing the Cosmos, from dusk until dawn. You can observe until you're so tired your eyes won't stay open, then you close the observatory up and you're in bed in less than 5 minutes.\nIf you browse amateur observatories on the internet, you know there are stunning examples. Many are classic domes that scream observatory when you see them. Many have roll-off roofs, so the observatory masquerades in the backyard as an ordinary shed. Some are built on housetops and some are built on stilts to see above trees. Some are spartan and utilitarian, and many are lavish with amenities and decorations. There are as many ideas and implementations for observatories as there are amateurs who have built them.\nLike many amateurs, I dream of having a large spacious observatory (of the roll-off roof variety), but after a scan of my local building codes and looking at the permitting process, and after many long evenings of planning and working out costs in a spreadsheet, I decided a big lavish observatory was probably still many years in my future.\nI was, however, faced with a pressing problem: I like to observe, and in the Rocky Mountains there is a LOT of snow to contend with for much of the year. Shoveling an observing area and setting up and tearing down the telescope in the cold was going to be a severe detriment to observing. So I devised a plan to have a Tiny Observatory. I was inspired by Dennis di Cicco's Doghouse Observatory, which he described in Sky & Telescope (June 2000, page 125). di Cicco said he built his original small observatory as a stop-gap while he planned for a bigger one, but it worked so well he observed in it for nearly a decade. Having spent many wonderful nights in my own small observatory, I see exactly what he meant.\nThe observatory described in this Instructable is called \"Star Gully Observatory\" (a joke, because I always wanted to call my planned big observatory \"Starlight Basin Observatory\"). This particular design is of a variety known as a \"fliptop\" or \"clamshell.\" It was built on the cheap, in a single weekend.", "title": "A Tiny Telescope Observatory", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/A-Tiny-Telescope-Observatory/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The key points in designing and constructing the observatory were:\nIt had to be less than the footprint (100 square feet) that required permitting\nIt had to store my telescope completely set-up, so I didn't have to do any assembly to observe\nAs cheap and as simple to construct as possible; if necessary it could be taken down and moved\nI wanted the observatory to be modular, by which I meant it should come apart into components, and then 1 or 2 people can carry them around. Why would I want that? I was anticipating that if I ever had to move, I could take it with me rather than starting from scratch again.\nCompared with the detailed planning that I had already done for a larger observatory, Star Gully was surprisingly designed on a couple of sheets of paper. The size was fixed by the floor, which was 8 ft x 8 ft, easily constructed from two full sheets of wood butted together. The walls were short, simple stud frames skinned with single sheets of wood (I used OSB -- oriented strand board -- as it was much cheaper than plywood). The roof panels were similar stud frames skinned with sheets of wood, but then covered with corrugated plastic garden roofing. There was no permanent foundation -- the observatory sat on cinder blocks laid down beds of pea gravel.\nAll the materials were purchased in a single Lowes run for about $500, and fit in the back of my pickup.

To provide plenty of support and rigidity (you won\u2019t want the telescope bouncing around when you move around in the observatory), the joists were put on 16-inch centers.\nThe two outside joists were end-screwed into the end caps using decking screws. The other 5 joists were mounted in joist hangers, then end screwed into the end caps using decking screws. The entire assembly can be picked up and moved by two people.\nTo provide a bit of protection from moisture, as well as a layer of trapped air (insulative, I hope \u2014 it can get cold standing at the telescope at night!), I covered the bottom of the frame with Tyvek, and then flipped it over onto the foundation blocks.\nThe top was skinned in two sheets of 5/8 OSB, screwed down into the joists, which makes it very rigid and stable.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNU/OTTJ/JM0V336K/FNUOTTJJM0V336K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVO/3ZY2/JM0V337B/FVO3ZY2JM0V337B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKN/9IUJ/JM0V337Y/FKN9IUJJM0V337Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJI/0GGC/JM0V3383/FJI0GGCJM0V3383.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Y/D8ZD/JM0V3385/F1YD8ZDJM0V3385.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS6/YIJO/JM0V3389/FS6YIJOJM0V3389.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1K/TCE4/JM0V338A/F1KTCE4JM0V338A.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Floor Frame"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "With the floor framed out, the next step was to put the walls in place.

I considered many different ways of lifting from the inside or outside, but they all really added to the hassle of opening up the observatory -- I wanted something simple.\nEventually I started thinking about counterweights, and this system was simple and elegant. The basic idea is the same as a see-saw (for those of you who remember your physics class, this is about balancing \"torques\" around the pivot point, which in this case is the hinges). I estimated the weight of each roof panel (quick and dirty, using the dimensions of the panels and the density of wood), and figured that a total of 90 pounds of weight could be used to make the roof panels pivot easily if the weights hung 2 feet out beyond the hingeline.\nI made long rails to hold the counterweights out of 2x6 lengths, and bolted them directly into the outer face of the 2x3 rails that make the outer edge of the roof frame. This worked perfect in the end because the rails covered the interface between the roof and the walls (effectively sealing it against the weather), and when the roof rotated up and open, the rail holding the counterweight was on the outside of the walls, allowing the roof to fully open! I probably couldn't have planned it that well if I had tried!\nFor weights, I got Olympic counterweights to put 45 lbs total at each corner. I mounted the counterweights on 2\" pipe fittings. First, I bolted a flange into the rail, and inserted a 6 inch length of 2\" diameter pipe threaded at both ends. The counterweights slip onto the length of pipe, and a solid cap goes on the outer threads to hold them securely in place.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F28/2837/JM0V34GJ/F282837JM0V34GJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ5/MFIC/JM0V34GK/FQ5MFICJM0V34GK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXB/S86D/JM0V34GL/FXBS86DJM0V34GL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAR/DP4E/JM0V34GQ/FARDP4EJM0V34GQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVH/8MED/JM0V34GP/FVH8MEDJM0V34GP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: Counterweights"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "In order to open and close the roof, and support it when it was open, I used a simple rope system.

I threaded lengths of 3/8\" braided polypropylene rope through the eyebolts, so when the roof panels were folded open, the taut rope loop stretched from the eyebolt on the roof peak to the eyebolt on the wall peak. In the pictures you can see I used a plastic hook that has a friction channel that allowed me to change the length of the loop if needed (though in practice I never used this feature -- I could have tied the rope in a permanent loop through the eyebolts).\nWhen the roof was closed, I used the same set of eyebolts and hooked a ratcheting tie down strap (red in the photo) through them to cinch the roof down and shut; a preventative measure against wind trying to lift the observatory roof up when the structure was closed.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F67/9A51/JM0V34VC/F679A51JM0V34VC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1B/50B2/JM0V34VD/F1B50B2JM0V34VD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCI/2H8A/JM0V34VE/FCI2H8AJM0V34VE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 11: Ropes"}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "In the interior, I put down foam interlocking flooring to make standing a bit more comfortable, provide a bit of insulation from the cold, and to protect dropped equipment.\nSpace is very tight, so there was no space to have a table to put star charts or my notes down, but the folded down roof panels were vast flat areas I could utilize!

I recommend buying a graphing paper notebook (or using SketchUp free software) and drawing to scale.Make your design unique! If you have access to a CNC machine, you can plan out super cool designs (design idea 2). Spend time thinking about the elliptical--or teardrop shape--design. Not only will a great shape have that iconic aesthetic, but it will improve aerodynamics and therefore fuel efficiency. You'll make friends wherever you go with a beautiful design because people will just come up and talk to you about it! Teardops that miss the mark on the curve can look awkward.

You can often get VERY cheap, heavy duty, used military grade trailers on government auction sites like this one. Of course, craigslist is a great resource for used trailers, but be careful you don't buy one with serious safety issues. Many retail TearDrop shops will outsource the trailer construction and opt for higher capacity specifications such as axles capacities over 2,000 lbs and heavy duty rectangular steel tubing, as opposed to weaker \"three sided\" channel tubing found in most kits. I talked to at least one manufacturer who told me that he took a significant loss on his first line of TearDrops because he used kit trailers. He has since upgraded to very heavy-duty trailers, but initially customers returned with bent trailer tongues and twisted metal. If you're going to buy from a manufacturer, be sure they didn't skimp on the trailer; not all manufacturers are kind enough to replace trailers after failure.\nIf you're going to go with a kit trailer, just choose a good one. I chose a kit trailer because it's cost effective. First, lay out and organize all of the parts. This particular trailer kit required a ton of bolting things together. As far as kits go, as long as the assembly is done correctly and the weight placed on the trailer and tongue do not exceed the design specs (including a large margin of safety), trailer kits offer the best value over more expensive pre-built, higher capacity trailers. This is especially true if your homebuild design is a small 4' x 8' base.\nThe most common homebuilt TearDrop trailer that I see is the Haul-Master Harbor Freight 48\" x 96\" 1,720 lb Super Duty Steel Kit (was $349, now $449). I started with this kit, but after assembling the trailer, I felt the 4' x 8' base was too small and the kit construction could have been better (one of the six bolts used to connect the tongue to the coupler was severely misaligned and a new hole needed to be drilled). I sold the trailer (LPT: you can sell \"new\" assembled trailers on Craigslist for more than the cost of the kit because people don't want to spend hours assembling it). I upgraded to the Northern Tool Ultra-Tow Aluminum 5'x8' 1,715 lb Payload Capacity Utility Trailer ($689).\nIf you have the equipment and skills, you're probably better off welding your own trailer from steel tubing (like this guy). There are several guides (trailer welding guide 2) on the internet that can help you.\nAs you can see in the pic, I had to flip the trailer upside down to make sure everything was bolted right. Invest in some squares (pictured), and take your time to ensure that everything is square and confirms to manufacturer's specs. These trailers take a ton of stress on the highway with all the weight; you want to take your time and do it right. In particular, you want to make sure the corners are a perfect 90 degrees and the distance from the wheel axles to the hitch coupler is equidistant on both sides (see SketchUp pic).\nI reinforced my trailer with 1.5\u201d 80/20 aluminum rail bars meant for aerospace applications (pictured). I wanted to \u201coverbuild\u201d everything, I decided to fabricate special brackets that could reinforce critical load-bearing points. The picture of aluminum being drilled is a bracket used to attach the jack in a way that was stronger than the standard bolt on design.I would recommend you reinforce the tongue as it takes a good amount of abuse, random lateral forces and pulling tension. Although, my tongue rails held up, eventually the aluminum split under the coupler (pictured) and needed to be re-welded (see pictures with fix annotation).\nYou can see that my trailer wheels are pretty scrawny and only rated for 55 mph (we drove up to 60 mph). You can easily replace those with thicker, heavier duty wheels (which I recommend). The one benefit of those scrawny trailer tires is that they're ubiquitous. You can find them in almost any auto-supply store or Walmart.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Trailer Construction"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I built my base platform out of wood. If you go this route, you're probably going be buying standard 2x4's from your local home improvement store. As you may know, this type of lumber is often rough and warped. The first step is to take a table saw and planer and square up those 2x4's. Again, given that this is the foundation for your home on the road, you want to take your time here. You can see that I wrote detailed measurements on the wood and took my time to ensure precision and perfect fits. There were metal bolts that stuck out of the trailer, and I had to use forstner bits to drill cavities in the wood rails for all those little bolts. Yes, this was pretty time consuming to get everything square, but I wanted the foundation to be perfect and an ultra-strong platform for the entire shell.\nI lined up all of the pieces on top of the frame. Because the frame had all sorts of unevenness and bolts, I had to measure precisely where the bolts would stick out, so that I could reliefs into the wood frame base. I also employed a ton of washers to make sure all of the spacings were right.\nNext, once you have a basic frame over the trailer rails, you can put down some sanded plywood (I don't recommend particle board) and lay it over the wood base frame.Once you've screwed in all of the flooring plywood, you can unbolt the entire platform, remove it from the trailer, and begin to apply a thick weather-coating protection layer of tar. To waterproof the underside, I used Henry\u2019s Asphalt Emulsion. I really put it on thick and applied two coats in different directions.\nNext I cut up some insulation panels (R-6 value) and put it in the gaps of the underside wood base frame. The panels were affixed to the base with bolts and the gaps were filled with great stuff.\nAt this point, I wanted to get the trailer fully registered and licensed because I was going to be driving it along the roads.

I took 15/32 sanded wood plywood 4x8s and started with them. Because the trailer would ultimately be about 10 feet long, I had to connect two panels together at a reinforced seam.\nI drew a grid onto the panels to match the graphing paper grid lines on my scale sized sketches on graphing paper. My design is loosely based on the Wyoming Woody teardrop design kit (the SketchUp .skp file is available in the photo gallery or from this website).\nNext I took a jigsaw and started cut out my sidewall design, and then I used a sander and router to even out all of the slightly uneven edges and tiny nicks.Using a drill and jig saw, I cut out the holes for all of the components. Next I used an airgun to affix squared wood strips to make the skeleton for the side walls. I wanted the sidewalls to be thick, but they had to be hollow in order for it to be light.I created a frame-skeleton in a piecemeal fashion and then used a router with a special bit to cut off all of the excess and make sure it all lined up.\nAt this point, you take more of your insulation board and fill in all the gaps. Lastly, you take the opposite sanded plywood sidewall and make a lil sidewall sandwich with the insulation in the middle. The bottom part of the sidewall had an overhang that fit the platform bed (see image). I applied glue to this seam and screwed the sidewalls in tight (while someone helped hold it square with a large framing square). I reinforced this connection using large (six inch) metal L brackets to hold that 90 degree angle.

I actually built out a basic frame for the kitchen galley before I started on the room to ensure those sidewalls are extra sturdy while you're screwing in roof beams.\nFor those cross beam supports (the ceiling joists), I used 2x2 beams (squared) and reinforced every corner with L brackets. I framed in supports for the roof star-gazing window and FANtastic fan (see pic). At this point, you really need to think about your electrical wiring configuration. I had a ton of electrical going along the roof to power the fan, two dome lights and a gooseneck dimable reading light (pictured), so just make sure you're not forgetting about that!\nWhat comes next is possibly THE MOST ANNOYING part of the entire build: adding the roof. Why is this so annoying? Even though birch plywood is semi-flexible, it doesn't want to bend into the nice beautiful elliptical shape. How do I do this? I created scored channels (relief cuts) that allow the birch plywood to bend. The more channels you add--and the more they are evenly spaced--the nicer the elliptical curve will be. Of course, given that this birch plywood is already VERY thin, you have to be careful about the table saw blade height. One wrong move and you can cut that expensive birch plywood clean through.\nNow that you have a flexible roofing material, you need at least one other person to hold that plywood up on the ceiling against the joints as another person takes the airgun and shoots a bunch of brads in. At this point, you're inside the teardrop shell pressing the plywood upwards against the roof framing and applying the interior part of the roof shell. You should also predrill some holes and use a couple (not too many because you want to be able to hide them) wood screws. If the plywood is not bending to the exact elliptical shape, you can take boiling water and moisten the wood. This will loosen up the fibers and give you a little bit more flex play. There might be a little gap along the seams where the roof plywood meets the side wall, but I wasn't too concern about this because I would later add a thin bead of beetle-kill pine wood as a trim. Once you put in the trim, the gap is invisible and it looks perfect.\nOne thing that I did (I am not sure if it helped) was fill in those channels on the opposite side with a compound mixture of sawdust and wood glue. I am thought adding some filling to those channels would ensure that the wood wouldn't split over the long run at those thin points.\nNext up, we cut out insulation panels and inserted them into the gaps. We filled in all the little cracks with great stuff spray foam.\nLastly, you want to add the outer shell layer to the roof. This isn't nearly as hard as the interior roof shell because you have gravity and an already very rigid frame working in your favor. One thing you can do is take straps to pressure the plywood to conform to the shape of the teardrop. Again, if the wood isn't bending perfectly, you can moisten it with some water (pictured).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5B/SN3A/JM0V5IG1/F5BSN3AJM0V5IG1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1F/FJJ7/JM0V1QVL/F1FFJJ7JM0V1QVL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC9/IGFC/JM0V5F1C/FC9IGFCJM0V5F1C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0N/0WHN/JM0V1QZK/F0N0WHNJM0V1QZK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJD/FZG0/JM0V1R3J/FJDFZG0JM0V1R3J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS2/C261/JM0V5FV5/FS2C261JM0V5FV5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX8/GOJA/JM0V4FY9/FX8GOJAJM0V4FY9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYF/LKWE/JM0V1RZA/FYFLKWEJM0V1RZA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9Q/MWGI/JM0V1RJF/F9QMWGIJM0V1RJF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVV/QH35/JM0V1T5M/FVVQH35JM0V1T5M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMY/MNM7/JM0V1RBH/FMYMNM7JM0V1RBH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0Z/ZV4X/JM0V1RVB/F0ZZV4XJM0V1RVB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB3/SO63/JM0V53BB/FB3SO63JM0V53BB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ4/VL3E/JM0V5F6G/FZ4VL3EJM0V5F6G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0L/VFSX/JM0V465V/F0LVFSXJM0V465V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1B/D7V4/JM0V1S3A/F1BD7V4JM0V1S3A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKM/LKRJ/JM0V1S7C/FKMLKRJJM0V1S7C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTF/ZB66/JM0V1R7I/FTFZB66JM0V1R7I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F59/SCUZ/JM0V1SF9/F59SCUZJM0V1SF9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSM/XSFD/JM0V1SJA/FSMXSFDJM0V1SJA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F22/WSZH/JM0V1T95/F22WSZHJM0V1T95.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7V/STU7/JM0V1SN9/F7VSTU7JM0V1SN9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1T/S6FA/JM0V4S6W/F1TS6FAJM0V4S6W.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Building the Roof"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "My design for the kitchen in the back hatch how to accommodate the following:\nA kitchen sink\nPlumbing for sink and external shower, including a water pump\nCavity for air conditioning unit\nCavity for electrical distribution panel and wiring\nelectrical outlets\nCabinetry\nGas line for stove\nBuilding out the kitchen is just slow and time consuming.

While you are framing the hatch, you should do it in the back where it will actually sit when closed. You can add little wood shims and spacers to get the exterior perimeter of the hatch frame lined up perfectly to your frame shape. You also need to measure very precisely how the the hatch hinge (often referred to as a \"hurricane hinge\" will connect to the hatch and the trailer frame.

It really \"makes\" the project. Beyond that, the aluminum does a fantastic job of actually protecting the shell from the elements.\nIt is likely that you have a metal supply shop near and you don't know it, but a quick google search can help you find a local aluminum sheet supplier. Try to shop around a bit because prices can vary greatly for small volume orders (most of these places are more like distributors for other manufacturers). I went to Olympic Metals in Commerce City, CO where they let me pick out my aluminum sheets and could not have been nicer! They snipped all of the metals to size.They even helped me strap the aluminum to my trailer.\nNext we had apply the aluminum skin. I coated the metal sheets and sidewalls with Weldwood contact cement and let it cure a bit. Because the weldwood cement sticks as soon as the glue is cured, I temporarily tape dowels to the camper so the skin wouldn\u2019t latch on to camper, which require me to pull it back off and possibly damage the skin. Once the skin is on, I used a wood dowel to roll out the skin and apply a lot of pressure so it sticks. This part is pretty physically exhausting, but you want to ensure the aluminum skin is evenly applied and doesn't have \"bubbles\" or uneveness. Once the cement dried a bit, I used a router with a special metal cutting trim bit to cut off the excess aluminum. Again, when cutting metal, go very slow and add lubricant such as WD-40. It pays to buy a quality metal-cutting router bit. Lastly, PLEASE wear safety goggles. You'll have little metal fragments spinning off and flying very quickly through the air.\nOnce the aluminum sidewalls were trimmed to size, you can apply the roof.

Many people build their own doors and components. I've heard that it can be a pain and introduce problems, such as leaking. The door that I purchased was ungodly expensive, but it was also very high quality. When it shut, it felt like you were shutting the hatch to a space capsule. The locking mechanism was also very high quality. My recommendation would be to pony up for the door, even though it is expensive.\nIf you're like me and you have custom pre-made components, then all you have to do is apply butyl tape around the edges of all of the components before installation and snap them into place. When you push the components in, you can use a utility blade to slice off the excess butyl tape, so it's all nice and flush. Then you can pre-drill several holes for the screws, insert screws and you should be good to go.\nIf you apply components from vintage technologies, they're often made so that you can weave in a rubber seal along the edging, which can hide the screws.

Not only did they contribute spare components, but they also helped me design it.\nHere are some guidelines:\nUse the appropriate guage wiring with a large margin of safety\nWhen in doubt, consult someone who knows a lot more than you\nI installed the following electrical components:\nProgressive Dynamics PD 4045 KV 45 Amp Distribution Panel\nRenogy 100 Watt Solar Panel\nEverStart 114 Amp Hour Premium FLA Deep Cycle Battery\n3/4 inch electrical conduit\nRed Cover Rocket Toggle Switches (5PK)\nDual USB Charging Socket\nLumitronics LED RC Exterior Porch Light\nGold Stars LED Dome Light Fixture\nDual USB Charging Socket and DC Volt Meter\nAcegoo LED Gooseneck Reading Light\n12V14 Guage Copper Strand Wiring\nTA10 12 Volt Receptacle\nTA02 120 Volt 15 amp male receptacle\nSiemens Q1515 Double 15 amp Breaker\nTYPE QTSiemens Q 130 30 Amp Breaker\n12 Terminal Bus Bar\nStandard Fuse 100 piece Variety Pack\nSiemens 20 Amp Circuit Breaker\nElectrical Terminal Variety Kit\n8 Guage Stranded Copper Wire\nInline Fuse Holder With Cover\nPower Disconnect Switch (EPO) 300 Amp\nAmarine 12V Water pump 35 PSI/1.1 GPM", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUO/FRPA/JM0V1SZY/FUOFRPAJM0V1SZY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE4/XQEM/JM0V5OIT/FE4XQEMJM0V5OIT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F26/524Z/JM0V1SZB/F26524ZJM0V1SZB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDA/0UPR/JM0V1SZA/FDA0UPRJM0V1SZA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYM/JK32/JM0V1RNE/FYMJK32JM0V1RNE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8G/JG9T/JM0V1SZC/F8GJG9TJM0V1SZC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2P/WE8Z/JM0V1SZX/F2PWE8ZJM0V1SZX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEZ/CDOQ/JM0V1N8B/FEZCDOQJM0V1N8B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUO/38NK/JM0V1T2X/FUO38NKJM0V1T2X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWH/FGI8/JM0V5PF3/FWHFGI8JM0V5PF3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTS/AF7M/JM0V5PF4/FTSAF7MJM0V5PF4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLB/DMJY/JM0V5SSV/FLBDMJYJM0V5SSV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQW/MATJ/JM0V62LU/FQWMATJJM0V62LU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSZ/QVK6/JM0V62LY/FSZQVK6JM0V62LY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEB/PB0X/JM0V62OC/FEBPB0XJM0V62OC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1X/B0H0/JM0V62PM/F1XB0H0JM0V62PM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYV/MO7V/JM0V62PN/FYVMO7VJM0V62PN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1G/S1SC/JM0V62PO/F1GS1SCJM0V62PO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ6/ISEL/JM0V62PP/FZ6ISELJM0V62PP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO1/VFDF/JM0V62PQ/FO1VFDFJM0V62PQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWO/OH79/JM0V62PR/FWOOH79JM0V62PR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2D/ABMR/JM0V62PU/F2DABMRJM0V62PU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Electrical and Solar"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "We kept the plumbing very basic: we have a 7 gallon water tank that sits in the back.

While packing my stuff I was not happy at all with the weight of my backpack and therefore decided to try to quickly build a saddle bag. The result was quite good and exceeded my expectations by far. In fact the bag by a very known bike brand that my collegeague had for this trip was dangling much worse than my construct. Therefore i encourage you to try and build this.

Watch the gif to see splicing in action (it might take a minute to load) =).\nFirst, lay your tether on the ground and fold it in half so the left side is two inches longer than the right side. Insert the short side of the tether into the bottom hole of your splicing fid (near the rounded end with the little hook). Now pick a spot just above the screw eye on the long side of the tether, cleanly part the braids with the needle end of the fid, and slide the fid directly up the middle of the long side. Take care that the fid stays inside the Technora down its entire length and doesn't catch an edge or otherwise pull any strands out of place.\nOnce the fid is fully inside the spliced end, you can start pulling and moving the fid along until it emerges from the top (you may need to loosen up the tape on this end for the needle to fit through). Remove the fid, set it aside, and continue pulling and smoothing out the spliced tethers until the screw eye is in a tight loop at the end.\nIdeally the ends of the inner and outer Technora braids should now be roughly in line with each other, but it's ok if the core is slightly longer than the sheath, or vice versa.

The point here is to keep the splice from slipping or loosening up at the critical point near the screw eye.\nContinue sewing in a circular direction around this ~1 inch long section of the tether near the eyelet. You can wrap a section of the tether with the thread a couple times to tighten it up even more (see second pic) \u2014 don't overdo it though as you want your tether to be able to bend. When only 2-3 inches of thread remain, cut the thread near the needle, take the two ends, and tie a triple knot, pulling tight against the tether. Trim off the excess thread and you're ready to move on to the next step.\n- A note about Technora -\nA clean splice and tight braid is crucial to the final integrity of your poi. Technora actually has a higher fire resistance (932\u00b0F) than kevlar (930\u00b0F), which is why we can attach it directly to the wick, but this fire resistance drops precipitously if the Technora braid is loose or elbowed. If the tether looks sloppy near the wick, I highly recommend sewing around it to tighten it up. You can further prolong the life of your tethers by taking care not to submerge them when you fuel up. Splash some water on your tethers near the wicks before you dip to really go the extra mile.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBV/8VVI/JKWUM7Z5/FBV8VVIJKWUM7Z5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDU/1GOC/JKWUM7Z8/FDU1GOCJKWUM7Z8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Sew Spliced End"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Collect your power drill, spade bit, wooden balls, 5-minute epoxy, stirring stick, some scrap cardboard, and your tethers from Step 2.\nAttach the spade bit to your power drill and find a flat work surface (a workbench is best, but you can also lay cardboard out on your floor).\nYou want to drill a hole deep enough for the top of the screw eye to be just below the surface of the core once it's been screwed in all the way.

Often the cost got us to around half the cost of the FJ and there were compromises as it wasn't our plan but someone else's. We also couldn't justify a dedicated camper trailer as we have a 2 car garage and we couldn't see us using half of it for something that can't hold cargo if we need to use it like a truck bed. This all pushed us to build our own trailer.\nWhat do you want it to do?\nSounds simple, drag behind and camp in. Well, it gets more complex, we never used a trailer to camp in and you can see in the pictures we originally came up with a hatch style system to access everything in the bed. We decided to make the trailer in 2 phases.\nPhase 1 was to make the trailer as a 4'x6' truck bed.\nPhase 2 to put a lid on it.\nWe decided this as we really don't know what we would need if our cargo happens to be 30\" square and the hatches we made were 28\" so we decided to make the trailer and see how we use it before moving to phase 2.\nHow big of a trailer?\nYou can find examples of trailers that are less than 4'x4' with small tires up to 30' dual axle monsters. We wanted a trailer that would hold about a truckload of gear, use the same wheels and tires as the tow rig and have a rack on the top to hold a tent. This got us to a trailer about 12' long with a 4'x6' box and sat about the same height as the truck.

Once you figure out what your going to build your trailer out of there are many many websites that tell you how much metal shapes weight per linear foot, so you can do this by hand. Its not impossible.\nPlan for safety.\nTrailers are simple tools provided you do 2 things.\n1. Have proper frame strength.\nIf the frame is too weak you will have the tongue bend and fail.

Have proper tongue loading.\nA vehicle can only take so much load on the ball of the hitch and if a trailer doesn't have enough weight forward of the axle it looses stability. Trailers can be designed correctly and still packed wrong so this rule is something you need to keep in your head the whole time.\nI used a PDF from Dexter Axle on how to place an axle you can find it |here|\nLicense the trailer.\nTake a look at your state/local government's laws for trailers. In TX I was able to licences this trailer as a equipment trailer as it was under the weight and not technically designed as an RV.

The fenders are also 12+ inches deep and flat to act as a table.\nSpare tire\nA spare tire was added to front of the trailer, this keeps the spare out of the cargo, protects the gas tanks and helps keep that weight forward.\nLights!\nWe purchased lights that were both brake, turn signal and running lights. Kept the wiring down and fewer holes to drill. The \"pod\" they are in is designed to once again take a hit and deflect it, that is why the leading edge has a taper to them. When I welded them on to the trailer I welded the top, sides and only the first few inches of the bottom so if water does get in it can fall out.\nWiring\nI had to get wire from the front of the trailer to the back. We decided to keep it exposed but inside the bed of the trailer. We used some 1\" angle and drilled matching holes on it to loop wire ties to it. This kept it exposed so if for some reason we needed to we can get to it but protected since its inside the trailer and high.\nRear drop legs\nIf the trailer is not on attached to a vehicle there is a real risk of the trailer tipping backwards if unloaded.

Take your knife or your scissors and cut a little less than half of the bottle away (Picture 1). After you cut the bottle, you will want to set the tip inside the bottle so that it can drain into the bottom piece. If you have done this correctly, it should look similar to (Picture 2). Next, take the coffee filter and expand it to conform to the edges of the bottle (Picture 3).\nThe next step is to prepare the filter through which the water will flow to give you 95% clean water! We will talk about the last 5% in a later step! Take your Sand / Dirt and add it to the colander (Picture 4). Be sure to have a bowl beneath the colander to catch your refined material. With the material in the colander, gently shake the material to separate the finer sand particles from the rougher sand particles. The distinction between the two should be rather dramatic (Pictures 5 & 6).\nFor the final step, you add the most-refined material to the least-refined material.

Mix the solution thoroughly. Once you add the bleach, it is wise to wait about forty-five minutes to an hour for it to kill all of the bacteria.\n* Tip* Sniff test! If you can still smell bleach after forty minutes, wait a little bit longer, it is probably still killing bacteria.

Same with the water pump cord and extension cord if you are using one.

So with a little research, I found that diamond drill bits were necessary to do this, along with continuous or semi-continuous spraying of cold water to keep everything cool. Turns out it was pretty easy!\nI found a diamond drill bit kit on Amazon for a pretty low price of under $10 and it had great reviews so I purchased it.\nWith the help of my wife (she sprayed the cold water while I drilled), I successfully drilled a hole into the bottom of a ceramic pot as a test run. Success! It was actually pretty easy. Here are the steps I took to drill holes through the teacup planter pot, the teapot, and the glass top to the wrought iron plant stand:\nUsing the diagram I drew of my plans, I figured out where each hole needed to go, and I marked the correct size hole with a dry erase marker. You can use pencil, or permanent marker, or whatever, but know that once water sprays on it, it may wash away. But once you start drilling, it won't matter because you already are in the spot you want to be in.\nChoose and attach the correct size diamond drill bit to your drill, and start drilling at an angle to the piece you are drilling into. Keep the drill at a rather low speed. This is a somewhat slow process. You don't even want to push down on the drill much at all. Let the drill bit do its work slowly but surely, all the while keeping cold water from a hose sprayed onto bit and the hole you are drilling to keep it all cool. If you don't spray water, it will all get HOT and can crack/shatter! Not good! Be patient!\nOnce you feel that a groove has been made, you can then start drilling straight on to the piece. In other words, you no longer have to drill at an angle. That is only done to get the groove started, so slowly start tilting your drill so it is facing straight on to the piece you are drilling into. See the videos for examples of how I did it.\nIt helps to have a second person helping you, but if you are by yourself, it can still be done. Just drill for a 5-10 seconds, and then stop, spray for a few seconds, and then continue drilling. This makes for an even slower process, but it can definitely be done.\nKeep drilling until you finally pop through the other side. Wash out any residual ceramic dust/pieces, and if drilling through glass, there WILL be tiny glass shards, splinters, dust, etc. I did mine on a towel both to keep the glass from getting scratched, but also to catch any glass as I drilled through. This was a smart move.\nI first drilled a large hole through the bottom of the planter pot (there was already a small drain hole in the bottom of pot).\nAfter drilling the large hole , I placed it on the glass table, and then drew circles with my dry erase marker ONTO the glass table top THROUGH the holes in the bottom of the pot. This insured that the holes would properly line up, enabling me to insert the water pump cord and the clear PVC tubing through their respective holes in the planter pot and then through the glass table top.\nI then drilled two different size holes through the glass table top. Sure enough, they lined up perfectly the holes in the planter pot.\nI had one hole left to drill into the teapot for the clear PVC tubing. The water will be coming in the teapot from the PVC tubing. I would have liked to have drilled into the bottom of the teapot but that is where the galvanized floor flange was going, so I opted for a hole on the back side of the pot, a little bit to the side and down from the lower part of the teapot handle. It was the best spot possible for the PVC tubing from a visual standpoint.\nAll holes were drilled successfully and took maybe 10-15 minutes for all holes to be completed. Not bad at all, and in my opinion, the hardest part was over.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FU9/TUNK/JL2KHDV5/FU9TUNKJL2KHDV5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXW/Y385/JL2KHDVV/FXWY385JL2KHDVV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC2/9XQA/JL2KHDVZ/FC29XQAJL2KHDVZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV1/VHZ2/JL47G7D6/FV1VHZ2JL47G7D6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQF/1VIT/JL47G75Z/FQF1VITJL47G75Z.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Drill Your Holes....carefully!"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Time to feed your pump cord and your PVC tubing through the holes that you made in the planter pot. But wait!\nInstead of drilling a very large hole so the PLUG of your pump cord can be fed through, we are cutting the pump cord with wire cutters or scissors, and feeding the pump end of the cord down through the bottom of the planter pot. When cutting the pump cord, cut about 8-12 inches distance from the plug. This leaves you with most of the pump cord still attached to the pump itself, and gives you quite a bit of slack when feeding the wire through the hole and also when reattaching the cut wire to the other cut portion of the pump wire. See pictures above for specifics.\nAfter cutting the pump wire, you will want to strip about 1/2\" or so of the insulation off the ends of the wire. You will see two copper wires in the end of your cut portion. Using your fingers, or the tip of your scissors (or knife), split this wire in half so the two copper wires are separated. See the sixth picture above to see what the wire looks like once separated. Then using either wire strippers or carefully using a knife, strip the 1/2\" or so off the end of each wire. If using a knife, do not cut the copper wire! Only cut the insulation (rubber part) off the wire.\nOnce done, feed that part of the wire down through the hole in the bottom of the pot (there can be some loose cord left IN the planter pot next to the pump so you can move the pump where you want to a little later.\nNow you will need to close up that hole in the bottom of the pot so no water can leak through. This is where your marine putty comes in. The marine putty I used was super simple! I did wear gloves though the package said it wasn't necessary unless you have sensitive skin. I didn't take a chance so I wore them. Break off enough of the putty to fill the small hole. The putty has two different colors, green and white. You simply mash them together with your fingers until the color of the putty becomes uniform which means it is ready for use. I recommend putting some putty both on the inside of the pot and also on the outside bottom of the pot to completely fill in and cover the small hole around the pump cord that you have just fed through.\nThis putty gives about 15 minutes of work time, enough time to work with it before it hardens and you can't change anything, but it only took me about 20-30 seconds to fill the hole. This putty takes about an hour to fully harden. This part could not have been easier.\nIn the meantime while that hardens, connect your PVC tubing to the pump, again, leaving some extra slack within the planter pot. I curled some of the PVC tubing around the inside of the planter pot like a cat curling up on a pillow in a warm sunny window. The tubing shape naturally wanted to do that. Once connected, feed the rest of the tubing through the large hole previously drilled in the bottom of the pot. Once done, use more epoxy putty to cover the larger hole in and around the PVC tubing, again, both in the pot and also on the outside bottom of the pot.\nI propped the planter pot up a little bit so the putty wouldn't dry and harden on my table. You may want to do the same.\nI took a little break at this point to let it all harden.\nOnce hardened, move your planter pot to the glass table, inserting both the pump cord and the PVC tubing through the holes drilled in the GLASS table top (a perfect fit, hopefully!).\nWell done so far!\nYou can start to fill your planter pot with your rocks/stones at this point. Make sure your pump is where you want it to be, along with your cord and PVC tubing. You can always remove the rocks and move them if you have to though.\nFill the planter pot to the brim, making sure to cover your PVC tubing so it can't be seen. I had to move a few rocks around to do this, as part of the PVC tubing was a bit close to the rim of the planter pot.\nLeave the cord and PVC tubing that is hanging through the bottom of your table. We will work with them a little later.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FH5/1C9K/JL47G81P/FH51C9KJL47G81P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIG/REFZ/JL47G86K/FIGREFZJL47G86K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEP/EIYB/JL47G89R/FEPEIYBJL47G89R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG3/J8JA/JL47G8CY/FG3J8JAJL47G8CY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBW/C1AY/JL47G8HQ/FBWC1AYJL47G8HQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFV/3ZS6/JL47G956/FFV3ZS6JL47G956.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1G/Y9WH/JL47G970/F1GY9WHJL47G970.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLU/RA2C/JL47G9B1/FLURA2CJL47G9B1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2L/AIVJ/JL47G8N5/F2LAIVJJL47G8N5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX4/N7FA/JL47G8RQ/FX4N7FAJL47G8RQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3E/L4EM/JL47G8WG/F3EL4EMJL47G8WG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9U/VSUZ/JL47G91A/F9UVSUZJL47G91A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTJ/I1IV/JL47G93E/FTJI1IVJL47G93E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVF/2QIR/JL47G9EC/FVF2QIRJL47G9EC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC0/8PWR/JL47G9GM/FC08PWRJL47G9GM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9P/5Y8Z/JL47G9IA/F9P5Y8ZJL47G9IA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAC/T6WE/JL47G9LH/FACT6WEJL47G9LH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFR/HZFM/JL47G9OP/FFRHZFMJL47G9OP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7C/I7NU/JL47G9RZ/F7CI7NUJL47G9RZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRP/AWNH/JL47G9YC/FRPAWNHJL47G9YC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTU/UD5H/JL47HDL8/FTUUD5HJL47HDL8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDU/UQN7/JL47HDL7/FDUUQN7JL47HDL7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Cords, Tubes, and Rocks!"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Time to put together the parts that will attach to your teapot, and then attach it all to your fence or wall.\nGet out your E6000 glue, your teapot, your galvanized floor flanges and screws/bolts, copper elbow, copper male adapter, and copper tubing.\n****Make sure you have adequate ventilation when using the glue.

It's rated to carry 1195 lbs and it's a 4' X 8' trailer. It was a steal at $299.99. However, I have since learned that Harbor Freight does not sell trailers anymore. It's a Chinese product (as are a lot of HF products) and the reviews I read were mostly positive, but for whatever reason, HF stopped selling them. [Update: HF started selling the trailers again for $349. YAY] The light kit that came with the trailer had to be replaced later, but overall, I was thrilled to get a trailer for $300. If I had known they were going to discontinue this item, I would have bought a few more.\nI went to the HF store in Topeka, KS to buy the trailer. It comes in a few boxes, and it comes with a title. It's a little chore to haul it home and put it together. I had never put a trailer together before. I just laid everything out in the garage and read the instructions over and over and over. Take it slow. The instructions were excellent, and as long as you follow along and pay attention to detail, everything should go together well. Getting it square was another challenge, but eventually, I got it square.\nI chose to register my trailer and get a license plate.

You want your foundation to be very strong, so be sure to get 3/4\" plywood.\nI rented a Home Depot truck to haul my plywood. The HD guys will help you load up the truck. Less than $30, if you live close to the store.\nBefore laying down the plywood, you need a frame to set it on. I bought 2 X 4's and ripped them in half on my table saw. They fit perfectly on the trailer. I screwed the corners together, as well as the middle pieces, then bolted it to the trailer. There are pre-drilled holes in the trailer, but sometimes I wanted more holes to screw into, so I made my own using my hammer drill and a metal drill bit.\nOnce the framing is all in place, lay down your 4 X 8 plywood and bolt that into the frame. I used 5 1/2\" hex bolts. I may have trimmed the plywood a bit.

I used little tiny nails to hold it in place to get my shape. Once I had the teardrop shape I wanted, and this was no easy task, I used a sharpie that I ran along the outside of the plastic trim. I then removed the trim and tiny nails, and used a jigsaw to cut out my shape. After cutting with a jigsaw, I had to do a ton of sanding to get it close to perfect. Once I had it nearly perfect, I used this as my template to create the other identical side.\nAs you can see, I placed my side pieces as far back as they would go on the foundation, leaving ample space in the front to build a box to hold the battery.

I think I bought 2 X 2's. Connecting the spars to the sides of the teardrop was challenging. On the one hand, I didn't want to ruin the perfect look of the exterior of the teardrop, but on the other hand, I needed to screw the spars in really well. I tried to countersink the screws, but some of them wouldn't go in far enough. Bottom line, the exterior of my teardrop looks a bit unprofessional. The spars have to be really solidly installed, because they are going to take a lot of pressure when the interior luan (thin, bendable plywood) is installed. I placed the spars at even intervals until I got up to where my Fan-tastic Vent Fan was going, and then measured carefully and placed the spars so that they would frame the fan. Very close to the fan, I also had to be careful to measure for the Stargazer window.\nAfter the spars are installed, and all necessary fan framing and stargazer window framing is done, the luan needs to be installed in the interior. Luan is super thin plywood that can be purchased in 4' X 8' sheets. Fortunately, my local HD has lots of it in stock, but I've heard it can be hard to find. Luan bends easily in 1 direction, and that happens to be the direction that produces the most waste for my project, so when all was said and done, I had purchased about 8 sheets and wasted a bunch of it. It's thin and flexible, and really hard to cut accurately on a table saw. It flops around like a dying fish as it falls off the end of the table saw, and doesn't want to stay still against the fence. Ugh! Total PITA. Once cut, I had to squeeze it in through the slats, then climb into the inside of the teardrop and basically push it into shape against the slats. Once I got it in place, I realized I had cut it just a bit too narrow, so I had to pull it out and cut another piece. The next piece was too wide. It was very frustrating trying to measure it accurately and get it in place. Luan is great, but I hate it while loving it. Finally after 3 tries, I got the measurement right. The back of my teardrop is sharply curved, and getting the luan into place, hoping it wouldn't crack from the pressure, was really, really, really difficult. Lots of swearing, lots of sweating, but finally it went in. Remember that I mentioned that luan bends easily in 1 direction? Well, the piece I put in was bent in the opposite direction, because at the time I didn't realize it bent easily in 1 direction. So it's a small miracle that I was able to get that piece in without it cracking.\nSide note about seams: where there were seams on the exterior, I used bondo. Just use blue painter's tape about an inch from the seam on each side, apply bondo, remove the tape while the bondo is still wet, and wait. It dries as hard as a rock, can be sanded (use a respirator and eye protection), and can be stained easily, and it looks very nice. Where there were seams on the interior, I just glued a thin piece of trim that I made out of scrap wood, and held it in place with a couple pieces of 2 X 4 wedged against the floor until it dried.\nWhile installing the luan, I also started making a battery box. This protects my battery from the elements. My father helped me make a simple hinged lid for it, and I was pretty happy with the way that came out. Not thrilled, but it serves the purpose. If I could do it over again, I would make the battery box a little bigger and spend more time on the design. I drilled 2\" holes in each side of the battery box and purchased Vintage Technologies TA19 RV Teardrop Trailer Camper 2\" Floor Vent 2 PACK. Apparently batteries need air (who knew?) so this provides some ventilation.\nThe solar panel lays flat against the outside of the teardrop, has wires running down through holes in the battery box to the charge controller, which connects to the battery.\nAs for the solar panel itself, I read that some people glue their solar panel to the teardrop, but it's really not as flexible as you'd think, and I didn't trust that I could find glue that would hold it down well, so I connected it with tiny bungee cords. I enjoy creating my own inventions and coming up with solutions, even though they are usually stupid. The little bungee cords work fine. At the top, they are connected to 2 little (glued on) hooks, like you would use in a kitchen to hold keys. It's simple and it works, even going 70 mph on the highway.\nOnce the interior luan was installed completely, I started putting the styrofoam insulation in the exterior spaces between the spars and the interior luan. Very simple, but you must use a special kind of glue that won't melt the styrofoam, Loctite PL 300 Foamboard Adhesive.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0O/7SME/JL6USMNG/F0O7SMEJL6USMNG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHG/UCK0/JL6USMNH/FHGUCK0JL6USMNH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOK/EDBO/JL6UST91/FOKEDBOJL6UST91.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEN/FEQL/JL6UST94/FENFEQLJL6UST94.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9Q/IM70/JL6UST96/F9QIM70JL6UST96.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGL/QDTE/JL6USWW1/FGLQDTEJL6USWW1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGY/IVOS/JL6UT1ZK/FGYIVOSJL6UT1ZK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Bendable Plywood, Spars, and Battery Box"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "This was probably the most rewarding part of the project, because once that exterior luan is glued on and stained and polyurethaned, wow, it starts to really look like a teardrop!

I had to read a lot about how to do this, as I had never used a router before. I ended up buying a Makita trim router, light enough for me to handle, but powerful enough to get the job done.

Very messy, must use eye protection and a face mask, but very rewarding and I was so impressed with this tool.\nThen I purchased the aluminum trim, and that just nails in easily.

I hung false \u201cbeams\u201d under the key joists using galvanized brackets and put the other deck joists on top of these. The deck would be mostly on the side of the trees away from the fence and would be supported also by two diagonals, mounted on diagonal brackets. To allow a boat shape, the deck had to project out quite a distance past natural support of the brackets. This made it necessary to have a cable supporting the bow (front) of the deck. I used a standard large lag screw mounted high and 3/16 plastic coated aircraft cable for this support. The cable became the ship\u2019s \u201cforestay\u201d (the trees are the ship\u2019s masts).

To this I would attach frames for the ship hull. I wanted exaggerated curves for the ship based on examples I saw on the web. I drew a bunch of curves (Bezier curves) using Sketchup and found I could get pretty curvy using 2x6s. My original thought was to design each frame and give the ship curves not only up and down, but also front and back. This turned out to be way too complicated. So all frames were basically the same except for at the front of the boat.

The oak sucks up the color from the wine and turns a beautiful purple. I didn't have any red wine barrels available at the time of making this so I used white wine barrels. Whiskey, rum, tequila, etc. barrels will work as well but most are heavily charred on the inside. This means you will need to remove the char in order to have a clean surface. A high buildup finish - like spar varnish - can be used to seal the char so you don't turn black when you sit in your adirondack.\nFinding barrels\nThe best way to get a barrel is to go straight to the source. If you have a local winery, call them and ask if they sell spent barrels. Be honest about the use. They may have an old dried out barrel kicking around as a table or parking barricade they may be willing to part with. Remember - you don't need anything that will hold liquid so it can be super gross and old.\nIf you don't have any wineries nearby, try calling a Brewery or distillery. Many use wine barrels to impart different flavors in their beer or spirits but, like at wineries, these barrels have a limited lifespan. At some point even the best cared after barrel will become a 'garden barrel.'\nIf neither of these are options, some garden stores or home improvement stores stock barrels as garden art, planters or rain barrels.

That's the full extent of my back story! These three things were what set me on my path for building a minion-shaped wood burner out of scrap metal, an old gas cylinder and a glass baking dish.\nBefore I started to build this little guy, I came up with a few ideas about what I wanted to achieve:\n- I wanted this wood burner to look just like a minion in every way - even down to the cheeky grin. :D\n- With the above in mind, the burner also had to be practical - easy to use and clean out after use.\n- The fire itself had to be visible - nothing quite beats gazing at the flames of a good fire.\n- It had to be made of reclaimed/re-purposed materials. 99% of the projects I've ever made follow this ethos.", "title": "Minion Wood Burner", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Minion-Wood-Burner/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I am fortunate enough to be something of a hoarder. I rarely throw stuff away if I think it might serve a purpose in future and so my garage is full of what most would consider to be junk. As a result, the only stuff I had to buy specifically for this project was the high temperature paint, the Pyrex glass dish (from a thrift store/charity shop for the equivalent of $3) and a few consumables like welding gas, angle grinder cutting/grinding discs and some masking tape. Everything else came from my stash of bits and bobs I've accumulated from flea markets, boot sales, and skips. In fact, I found this very gas cylinder in a skip. Not a sensible place to dispose of an explosive container so probably just as well that that I was able to rescue it!\nIn terms of specialist tools for this project you'll definitely need some kind of welding equipment and an angle grinder. The jig saw was very handy for cutting out some of the metal parts but it's not essential. Most parts could be cut roughly with an angle grinder and then filed to shape, and smaller pieces could be cut out with a hacksaw. I'd also recommend using a decent fine tip marker pen for marking out the metal.\nIn terms of safety, cutting into gas cylinders is NOT recommended. Clearly there must be 100% certainty that there is no gas inside the cylinder before cutting begins. I cannot stress this enough. I'm not going to go into too much detail about this but essentially the only way to be sure is to start with an empty cylinder in the first place and then fill it up with water, thus forcing any remnants of gas out of the cylinder. Do this in a well ventilated area away from heat sources. Empty the water out before cutting into it with your angle grinder as water and electricity don't mix too well either! Also, when it comes to working on the cylinder, bear in mind that heating up the paint and the metal can also give off nasty fumes so again, wear a mask and make sure the area is well ventilated. Also, welding stuff can make things catch on fire, cutting things can throw bits of metal in your face.

I got to know the minion clan quite well, but decided Stuart was the one for me. He's the chap with the single eye and a perfect gas cylinder shaped body. Handy!\nThe only constraints for this project were the gas cylinder and the Pyrex dish lid. Once I'd established roughly where the lid was going to fit onto the cylinder, I knew I could kind of make the rest up as I went along - making sure that the arms, legs, feet and hands were in proportion to the rest of the burner. All of this was done by eye - I don't actually recall using a measuring tape at any point during this project!\nI should add that the reason for opting for Pyrex glass is because it's is resistant to expansion when heated - ordinary glass will almost certainly crack or shatter when exposed to this kind of heat.\nAs I wanted to load wood into the burner through Stuart's eye, I decided the eye itself would have to be hinged. I also wanted the flue to come out the back of his head (rather than out of the top) as I thought it would be more aesthetically pleasing to keep it out of the way... and poor Stuart doesn't want to look like a chimney! I also needed a way to clear the ash out and a way of lighting the wood and getting some air into the bottom of the cylinder and so the burner was going to need a couple more 'doors' cut into it.\nWell, that's it for the planning stage.

It's also the starting point as everything else stems from this, including cutting the cylinder. I started out by placing the Pyrex lid onto a sheet of ~2mm steel and drew round it. Then using a pair of compasses I drew an inner circle. Cut this out so that you're left with a Pyrex dish shape piece of metal that has a hole in the middle of it, let's call this piece 1. Unfortunately I didn't take any pics of this alone but all becomes clear once you see the pics on the next step. Essentially, piece 1 will be welded directly onto the cylinder.\nNext, I repeated the processes of drawing around the Pyrex dish onto a piece of sheet metal. For this piece, aptly named 'piece 2' (though perhaps I should've called it the eye-lid) I also needed to include the pupil of Stuart's eye. It turned out that the roll of masking tape I'd bought was perfect for drawing round to form this as shown in the pics. Then, before cutting, I held this up to the cylinder to get an idea of where it would sit and how much metal I would need to leave around the eye in order to fit a hinge, a catch for the door, and to fit mounting brackets for the glass lid itself. Then I cut piece 2 out with the jigsaw. At this point I marked out holes to drill out in each cornea, corner, (sorry) of the eye in order to mount the glass onto the metal.

I welded the arms onto the body, ensuring that these did not obstruct the opening/closing of any of the doors.\nThe hands were made from chrome tube (an old curtain rail) and some sheet metal scraps. As you can see, the fingers were formed by making cuts part way through the tube. This then allows the fingers to be bent to shape. As you can see on the pics, I had drawn a very rough hand shape on the sheet metal. This gave me some idea of where to weld the fingers to. Once the fingers were in place I literally used a pair of pliers to bend the thin sheet metal round to form a hand. Once the back of the hand was formed, I fettled another piece of scrap to form the front of the hand. Again, there was not an exact science to this. I knew roughly where the fingers were and so I made small cut outs for these before welding the front of the hand into place. This was then bent with pliers to line up roughly with the back of the hand, forming a 3D shape. It was a crude approach but actually quite effective. They looked great once they were sprayed black.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F65/MK9P/JKSKETI0/F65MK9PJKSKETI0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE2/J4P8/JKSKETI6/FE2J4P8JKSKETI6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2S/R1WG/JKSKETP8/F2SR1WGJKSKETP8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYD/07B3/JKSKETQL/FYD07B3JKSKETQL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPO/EP7A/JKSKETTC/FPOEP7AJKSKETTC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFQ/73QE/JKVCSBCT/FFQ73QEJKVCSBCT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Arms and Hands"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "By this point Stuart felt he needed more cosmetic surgery like he needed a hole in the head. Unfortunately, a hole in his head what exactly what he got. I cut a square out with the angle grinder and then formed a circle by making a number of small cuts with the angle grinder. I could've used the jig saw but it wouldn't have been easy to cut out given that this was a curved surface and thick metal. The angle grinder was then used to chop each little piece off and form a round(ish) hole. I then used a piece of metal bar to form an imperfect circle within the hole as shown in the pic. No one is going to see this bit so it doesn't need to be all that pretty! Once this was 'delicately' put into position using a big hammer(!), it was welded into place and I then went on to make the flange. This was simply a piece of sheet metal cut out with the angle grinder again. I think I'd given up with the jig saw by this point as it was painfully slow to use by comparison. I then ground the flange to circular shape, lined up the old boiler flue and then drilled and tapped some holes in the corresponding positions. The flue could then be screwed on once I'd finished spray painting.\nHoarding tip #347: Build up a reputation amongst your peers.\nMy friend was having his boiler replaced and naturally he called me to see if I wanted any bits from the old one.

For his dungarees, I wanted there to be an obvious lip between his clothing and his torso so that it looked like he was actually wearing clothes, rather than the waistline just being spray painted on. I achieved this by welding on thin metal strips around his torso as shown in the pics. The braces were then made from strips of thin metal. Using thin metal here worked well as it naturally wanted to bend into the right position. With thicker metal, I'd have struggled to get such a uniform curve across the full length of the strip.\nThe glass was attached to eye using threaded rod which was bent around the glass and then bolted into place through the holes I made on the door back in step 3.

I did three coats of each colour. This paint is able to withstand temperatures of up to 700degC (1292degF) but I had doubts as to how well this would cope with the burner being used long term. The paint also requires heating up to a specific temperature and then left to set.

I just had to figure out how to fix it.\nThe real problem is finding the right adhesive. There are so many choices and lots of things to consider when using a mirror for outside decor. For instance, do you experience wide temperature fluctuations where you live? In our climate, an adhesive has to be flexible enough to withstand extremes in temperature.

It was also given a light scuff with 220 grit sandpaper and wiped again.

Green painters tape was applied around the inside of the frame to protect from overspray.\nMy husband used a sprayer to apply the paint. Once dry, I removed the painters tape to prepare for adhering the mirror.\nCut Backing\nMeasure the width and height on the back of the frame and cut a piece of corrugated plastic for the backing.

You can't do that with 100% silicone! We purchased a clear formulation; it\u2019s goes on white but becomes clear as it cures in 7 \u2013 14 days.

After all the noodles were sewn together, the noodles all stay in place, but if you sit on the seam or fold the raft, the hose in the noodle will pull out as the glue doesn't have any strength.

For that we used vinyl landscape edging (also a Habitat find). we cut the shape (a rectangle with rounded corners) for the sink well out of the melamine, and cut the landscape edging longwise so it would be the same height as the sidewalls of the form when done. This was to allow us to screed the concrete across the whole top of the form after pouring the concrete in.

Next time the fiber trunk will come out near the middle, away from everything else including the future wooden legs which hold the table up. We used zip ties to secure the 6 bundles of fibers to the reinforcement wire so when the concrete was added there would be less stress on them. The fibers are pretty flexible, but if you bend them so much that they crimp over, most of the light will not get through that crimped area. In the end I also had 10-12 fibers coming out the bottom of the table with the rest of the trunk that got cut somehow. I'm not sure how they got cut, but I made the table thicker than I would if I did it again (see the section: Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then) so there are 4 80# bags of concrete in my table plus the water (not sure if that adds to the final weight or not) so 320# at least in the top alone. I suspect they got crimped hard enough to break them in two while we were flipping the table or pouring the concrete.\nOnce the fibers were pretty evenly distributed across the length of the table, we drilled small holes in sort of a random 'starry sky' pattern in the bottom of the form, cut the fibers to length, dipped the ends in hot glue and glued them into the holes hoping when we added the concrete they would stay put. I think they all did or at least the vast majority did. The smaller fiber bundles and sometimes individual fibers were also zip tied to the reinforcement wire if it looked like it would help them stay put. We also put a few fibers the same way into the side of the form that would be the front of the table in the end, and through the vinyl wall of the sink well.

These were cut off at the surface with a sharp razor.\nThe un-forming revealed problem areas. Some areas of the surface and sides had issues where the concrete had not settled correctly. My takeaway was next time, rent a concrete vibrator. In the end these problems were solved by mixing a slurry of portland cement and rubbing into the surface by hand in 2 applications with some sanding in between.\nThe application of a slurry took to table finish in an unexpected direction. For reasons that aren't entirely clear to me now, I was a little worried that the slurry might obscure the lighted ends of the fibers. To counter this perceived threat, I mixed a small batch of epoxy and placed a drop on the end of each fiber. My thought was that these would sand off, but they turned out to be much tougher than I expected. The epoxy spread out more than I expected, and formed sort of a bubble lens over each light, which was kind of cool if unexpected.

We spaced them evenly with the thick ends butted up to the sink and glued them to the melamine form with spray adhesive (remember the bottom of the form is the surface of the table). The goal was a relatively flat countertop with an area of sloping grooves or channels down until they drain into the sink. In the first picture you can see the shims glued down to the melamine peeking between the two boards suspending the wire. The subsequent pictures show how it looked when we un-formed it.\nThis worked absolutely great as far as imparting the desired shape. The problem was we didn't seal the raw, dry wood shims and so the concrete in this one area ended up being more crumbly than the rest of the table. What we hoped would be crisp 90 degree angles ended up anything but. I think the moisture moved back and forth from the concrete to the wood and this was the result.

In the same spirit I epoxied a piece of scrap treated lumber to the bottom of the table to mount the light engine to the bottom of the table.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLP/VFOL/JK4ULLUZ/FLPVFOLJK4ULLUZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7H/16VE/JK4ULLPP/F7H16VEJK4ULLPP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0C/IUWD/JK4ULLSP/F0CIUWDJK4ULLSP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG7/WBO2/JK4ULLSA/FG7WBO2JK4ULLSA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQV/YORR/JK4ULLSC/FQVYORRJK4ULLSC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: The Legs"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "Actually, learning is why we do these things, so here is a summary of the lessons that came at some cost in additional effort or sacrificed vision:\n1: Rent a concrete vibrator. If it's only $20 or $30 rent a mixer too. The work saved with a mixer is less a factor than producing all the needed concrete quickly. The vibrator might have saved us several steps which took days (mostly drying/curing, only a few hours of working) to fix.\n2. Bring the light trunk out of the bottom away from any other features or structures of the table. If I were doing it again, I would bring the trunk out more parallel to the bottom surface of the table rather than the virtual 90 degrees that this one was to soften the curve from the eventual intersection with the light engine which in our application was parallel to the bottom of the table. Plan your legs to ensure you have lots of clearance around the light trunk. I might even encase the trunk in PVC or something (at least tape it as a bundle) to help protect it. about 10-12 fibers got folded hard enough to crimp and break them at some point in the project. We had actually laid out the constellation Orion in 'stars' when we drilled and attached the lights to the mold. One of the light fibers that broke was the center star in Orion's belt. So the single potentially recognizable feature we tried to incorporate had one of its iconic points fail. You would never know if we hadn't told you, so it's just a lesson we wanted to share. In a truly random application, losing 10% of the lights wouldn't matter that much. If you're trying to shape the image, random failures can be a big deal.\n3. All elements of the form need to be impermeable to concrete/moisture. Using bare wood was a rookie mistake. We hope you learn from ours instead of your own\n4. We made our table 2\" thick. Why? \"It seemed like a good idea at the time.\" Aside from being very heavy, the planned faucet for the sink was not long enough where it passes through the surface to attach the nut that holds it in place (really, none of the commercially available faucets have throats long enough for a 2\" thick mounting surface). We're working on a fix for this. Not planning the table legs ahead of time also resulted in a conflict that will need to be mitigated before a faucet can be attached. It seems like people are pretty consistently casting concrete counters 1\" thick. Getting the reinforcement wire and optic fibers in place with a 1\" space to work would be more difficult, but is probably worth it. The next one we try will be 1\" thick.\n5. Plan the base from the beginning. Setting some treated boards into the table bottom to aid in attaching the base would have been a good idea. Or some bolts to attach the base so it could be more secure. Not to mention making sure your sink, faucet, and light fiber trunk are out of the way of your structure.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMT/I5BT/JK4ULLMM/FMTI5BTJK4ULLMM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB1/ZG69/JK4ULLP7/FB1ZG69JK4ULLP7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 11: I Wish I Didn't Know Now, What I Didn't Know Then...."}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "We hope this helps anyone thinking about trying something like this.

But old fashioned though it may be, it is still a simple, affordable way to go backpacking, transport all your gear, and more easily carry heavy loads. Here are just a few of the benefits we've seen from this pack:\nYou can make it out of materials you have on hand (which would come in handy in an emergency situation).\nIt is much cheaper than buying a state-of-the-art backpacking pack.\nYou can use your existing duffel bags and gear, since you can tie things on in whatever configuration works for you. This also leads to better access to all of your gear.\nThe curved ribs keep the pack slightly away from your back, which makes for better air circulation.\nThe frame allows you to lift the weight off your shoulders while sitting without having to remove the pack.\nIt does not require advanced woodworking or sewing skills. At the same time, it is completely customizable, so if you have more skill you can do more advanced adaptations to meet your needs and aesthetic ideals.\nMaterials:\nWood Frame:\n1.5\" x 3/4\" x 33\" poplar uprights (2)\n1/4\" x 1.5\" x 22\" poplar support (1)\n1/4\" x 1.5\" x 17\" walnut ribs (2)\n1/4\" x 1.5\" x 20\" walnut center rib (1)\n2\" x 6\" x 18\" board (1) to create the form for the ribs\n1/2\" pan-head screws (6)\n1/4\" x 1/2\" bolts (2)\nWashers (2 per bolt) and nuts to match\nWood glue\nClamps\nCanvas Skirt and Straps\n1 yard of 12 oz canvas (or at least a 36\" x 36\" square of repurposed sturdy material). If you choose to add the waist strap, you'll need an additional 1/2 yard of fabric.\nGrommets (24) with tools to install (usually included with grommets)\n5' length of paracord (to lace canvas skirt)\n25' length of paracord (to lash things to the pack)\n1.5\" x 10\" leather strips (2)\n4\" x 5\" leather pieces (2)\n1\" x 6' nylon strap (1) plus an additional 4' length if you choose to add the waist strap\n1\" plastic buckles (2) plus an additional 2 buckles and 1 snapping buckle for the waist strap\n1\" D rings (2)", "title": "Customizable Pack Frame", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Customizable-Pack-Frame/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The heart of this pack is the sturdy wood frame. We used poplar and walnut, but the type of wood you use doesn't really matter; any stout wood will work.\n1. Create a form to bend the walnut ribs. On a 2\" x 6\" board (I used plywood, because I had it lying around), draw a curve where the center is two inches above the ends. Cut out the curve using a scroll saw. Drill several holes in the form to hold clamps.\n2. Steam the three walnut ribs one at a time to make them malleable. I created a simple steamer using a hot plate, tea kettle, and dryer vent tube (again, this is what we had laying around). Once they are pliable enough, bend the walnut strips to the form and secure with clamps. Allow time to cool.\n3. Meanwhile, make 1/4\" x 1.5\" dado cuts in the two uprights 3 inches from the top, then two more ten inches on center from the first. These will make the ribs sit flush against the uprights, but if you'd rather you can just glue and screw them together without the dado cuts (though it won't be as strong). Sand the two poplar uprights so they are smooth. You will also want to taper and round the bottom of each upright so you can easily attach the thimbles later.\n4. Assemble the frame by gluing the ribs into the dado cuts in the uprights, then screwing them in place.

You can also buy cheap canvas by the yard at your local fabric or craft store.\nHere are the steps to create your skirt:\n1. Cut a 22\" x 36\" rectangle of canvas\n2. Sew a 1-inch seam around every side\n3. Cut holes for the middle rib ends (the slightly longer ones) of the wood frame to come through the canvas. The position of these holes will depend on how wide your frame is and how high or low you want the canvas cover to be on the frame. I laid the canvas on the table, placed the frame on top, and marked where the edge of the frame would come through. I then cut 1 and 1/2\" x 2\" holes in the canvas to accommodate the frame. I cut a small rectangle out of the middle of the outlined square, leaving 1/2\" of fabric on each edge, then cut diagonally to the corners of the marked hole so I could fold the fabric back and sew it to create a hem. You could also sew around the raw edge of the hole to prevent fraying, though the end result may not be as neat.\n4. Cut a 3/4\" x 4\" slit in the top center of the canvas, just below the seam, for the straps to come through. The key is to have the slit meet the bottom edge of the top rib, since that is where the straps will be attached. Again, you will need to either create a hem or sew around the edge of the hole.\n5. Add 10-12 grommets, evenly spaced, to each short edge of the canvas. You can find grommets at hardware or craft stores, or order them online. Find a set that comes with the basic tools to install them, and follow the instructions on the package. It is a fairly simple process that consists of cutting a small hole, inserting the two sides, and using the tools to hammer them in place.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8M/AYHY/JK2UHXTK/F8MAYHYJK2UHXTK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9E/P7UU/JK2UHXTL/F9EP7UUJK2UHXTL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA5/1730/JK2UIFA1/FA51730JK2UIFA1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG6/SR6L/JK2UIF9G/FG6SR6LJK2UIF9G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F63/QRL3/JK2UIF9F/F63QRL3JK2UIF9F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8P/MAA7/JK2UHXTJ/F8PMAA7JK2UHXTJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F35/XSN0/JK2UIG94/F35XSN0JK2UIG94.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEI/7PP2/JK2UIG91/FEI7PP2JK2UIG91.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Canvas Skirt"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "We used leather, canvas, and nylon to make the straps (leather and canvas to match the overall look and nylon for ease of adjustment).

Measure the circumference of the tapered edge of each upright (if you cut a piece of paper to fit, you can just trace it onto the leather, with a 1/4\" seam allowance).\n2. Cut the 4\" x 5\" leather pieces to the length of the circumference plus seam allowance, with an extra two inch piece sticking up from the center of the top to fold over into a loop (see picture). Cut out the leather and sew the two sides together to form a tube, then fold and sew the top piece down into a loop around a D ring.\nShoulder Straps:\n1. Cut two 8\" x 16\" pieces of canvas. Fold the edges over for 1\" seams, then iron in place. Fold the entire piece in half lengthwise to form a 3\" by 14\" strap and iron the fold.\n2. Add batting or foam padding to the inside of each piece.\n3. On one end of each piece, fold in and iron the corners (if desired), then place a 1\" by 10\" leather strip between the two layers of canvas, with 2 inches of leather encased in the strap. Pin everything in place.\n4. Cut two 10\" pieces of nylon strap. Thread one through each buckle, then fold in half, placing the two ends 2 inches deep into the other end of the strap (again, folding in the corners if desired). Pin this end in place as well.\n5. Sew a seam 1/4\" from the edge all the way around each strap. Then, for added strength and stability, sew a diamond pattern of 1\" squares across the entire strap (see image for reference). We also sewed two extra straight lines 1/4\" and 3/4\" down from the seam on each end to better secure the leather and nylon straps.\n6. Cut the remaining nylon strap material (just over 4 feet total) in half. Thread each half through one of the D rings in the thimbles, then fold 2 inches of the strap back onto itself and sew it closed.

Cut a piece of canvas the length you came up with in #1, by 10\" wide.\n3. Fold the edges over for 1\" seams, then iron in place. Fold the entire piece in half lengthwise to form a 4\" wide strap and iron the fold.\n4. Add batting or foam padding to the inside of each piece.\n5. If you'd like the corners to come in from the edge a bit on the ends, you can fold the material into the middle and make a seam (see image). Pin the edges to hold everything in place.\n6. Sew a 1/4-inch seam around the edge of the entire strap.\n7. Take the 4' length of nylon strap and find the center. Match the center of the strap with the center of your canvas waist strap and pin the nylon down the center of the strap to the edges (you should have a fair amount of extra nylon strap hanging off each end).\n8. Before you sew the strap down, you'll need to mark a few places to leave openings so you can attach the waist strap to the backpack. Lay the waist strap against the bottom rib of the frame. Mark each edge of the center poplar support, then mark a spot 1\" away from the support on either side. You won't sew the nylon strap down between the two sections on either side of the support to allow for a strap or paracord to attach the waist strap to the frame. You will also need to mark similar spaces next to the inside edge of the outer uprights.\n9. Sew the nylon strap to the canvas waist strap, leaving the marked loops clear.\n10.

Give the threadlock at least 15 minutes to cure, 24 hours for best result.\nPut one of the split washers onto your rod and lay your tube next to it, up against the split washer. If your rod is exactly as long as your tube, or longer, you need to cut some off.

The thing to keep in mind here is to leave just enough space (rod) for the speartip to be screwed on! Leave the pipe about 3mm longer as opposed to an exact fit, to ensure you tighten your tube in between the eyenut and speartip!

So to give it a new life and a couple more years of useful service, I decided to re-use this aluminum tube for a polespear.\nThe great part of this tube is that it has a widened end on one of its sides, and the normal side is just big enough to cover the narrower part of the speartip! This will be very useful for putting-together.\nA downside is that it\u2019s made up out of 2 parts.\nThis was a lucky find and I don\u2019t expect a lot of people will find this exact kind of tube.\nStart off by securing the 6mm locknut on one end of the threaded rod. My threaded rod is bent at the end, so I\u2019ll have to screw a nut on from the other side. It won\u2019t cause any trouble though.\nTake the aluminum tube with the enlarged bottom, now with an 6mm acornnut and a fitting bolt I\u2019ll try to hammer it in the tube. Only enough so the indentations show of a 6-sided-nut inside the tube.\nScoot the aluminum tube over the rod with the widened part going over the locknut. Now you\u2019ll have to take a nut and screw it all the way onto the tube (I use my electric drill to speed things along here, put your nut on the thread and the threaded rod into your electric drill. Don\u2019t fasten too tight or you will damage the threads! Put electric drill in reverse and hold on to the nut as you slowly start rotating your drill). Before you hit the tube, jam the (hammered) indentations onto your nut and use the tube as a handle to fully tighten the tube in between the nuts!\nYou could put some indentations in the other tube-part as well, but I figured it wouldn\u2019t make a big difference, so I decided to leave it. Scoot your other tube-part over the threaded rod now aswell.\nNow either your tube or your rod will be sticking out further than the other, so one of both needs to be cut to length. If you look at the picture you can see I need to cut my rod down several cm\u2019s. The thing to keep in mind here is to leave just enough space (rod) for the speartip to be screwed on! I cut my rod as long as my tube is.\nSo, in steps, mark your rod, remove top tube, screw on a nut (read tips), saw rod to length, file for neat end, unscrew nut, replace top tube, screw sprearhead on!\nNow with your 1/8\u201d drillbit, plunge a hole near the end of the pipe and widen that hole now with an \u00bc\u201d drillbit. File the hole to make sure there are no more burrs in or around the hole (this will weaken or damage your rope).\nCover the connecting pieces with a bit of electrical tape for an clean look and a bit thickness for grip (a more solid grip on the fairly thin tube when cocked and ready to shoot).

It needs to sit in at least 1cm deep, so\u2026 I think my chances are reasonable\u2026\nInspired by the tube I found in the scrounged-around-the-house build-option.\nI\u2019ll heat up the tube, put a acornnut attached to a fitting hexbolt on the backend, put your tube on a block of wood and try to hammer it in gently (or barbarically, which ever works!).

This way if you need to change anything, it is still completely dismantlable/ replace-able.\n- You can also use rope or cord as a grip-feature on a spear (glued in place).\n- Make sure there is still a way for water to enter and drain out of the tube. A waterfilled spear shoots better as an airfilled one, so don\u2019t make it airtight (using glue or anything).\n- A little epoxy or threadlocker makes for a solid nut-to-thread-connection, just don\u2019t accidentally fill/ airtighten your tube!\n- The counterhooks on the speartip are (very) aggressive. So much so that it will take chunks out of your fish or it will damage the funnel of your zookeeper when trying to get the fish off. I suggest (on these spearheads) to grind down or flatten 3 of the 6 counterhooks.\nIn the picture you can see one of my older spearheads; the outer (3) spikes are counterhook-less! On the new one I hammered the inner 3 counterhooks flat with the help of the sawn-off piece of rod\n- Use a solid 12mm rod. Drill a hole 5mm wide, 5cm deep into the top of your rod. Take a 6mm hex bolt (6cm long), grind down the theads just slightly on the 5cm you intend to insert into the rod and hammer in (like frkng Thor himself!). Angle-grind the hex-nut-head off and clean the top up. You could use some epoxy, this wasn\u2019t necessary in my case. Screw on speartip and don\u2019t forget to put a hole in the back for your sling to attach!\nOR\u2026 use a 15cm long 6mm hex bolt, Thor it in, cut off hexbolt-head, file/ grind the threads off leaving just 1 strip of theads (vertically, 1mm wide to act as \u2018counterhooks\u2019) and grind/ file a point to it. No need to spend 30bucks for a speartip! Single barbed spreartip tho.\n- When you have to saw your threaded rod, make sure you have a nut on the inside. Screw off after sawing and filing to align the thread again.\n- When using a different sling or different length (spear or sling) the 55 -75cm might not match up with your grip. You might want to wait with taping until you can try the sling itself.

Although some of these changes incorporate a commercial accessory, some construction and customization was still necessary to accommodate the modification and its intended use in the camper. The idea for most of the changes may not be unique but the manner in which I approached the change is mine. Ultimately fun and function was the goal.\nA few of the individual add-ons and changes have details for someone to follow, others just have a few pictures and the change that was made is sort of implied. I am familiar with other models of teardrop campers and many of these modifications would work just as well with them or with individual home-built units.\nAs a bit of background, I am a member of a group of enthusiastic, micro camper (tiny trailer) owners who gather a couple of times each year for campsite camaraderie. Some of the camper trailers are commercial teardrops, as is mine, while others are homebuilt from the ground up. Although most of us are minimalist campers, we still enjoy adding a small change that makes the camping experience more comfortable and fun. I always leave a gathering with another idea, a photo of a different way of fixing something, and wondering how I might do just that to my camper. Those get-togethers are a source of my inspiration.\nAny modification for use in my teardrop that uses electricity must utilize 12-volts as my only source is one 12 volt battery. Inverters will only draw down my battery too quickly and currently I do not have a solar battery recharging system in place. Since I mainly camp where there is no 110 power supply, I have made a decision to use LED lights only, a low watt fan and a motorcycle radio to keep the draw on the battery low. I use a traditional ice box as a refrigerator. Without my vehicle recharging the battery, I can easily get 6 or 7 days off the single battery charge.\nAnd so that is what I am doing with this instructable, sharing my fav\u2019s and providing some ideas for your own modification. As with my earlier project, focussing on the rebuild and construction of the \u2018Steampunked Teardrop\u2019, sometimes working on a new project is as enjoyable as the camping is fun. So be creative, construct and enjoy.\n_________________\nFeel free to leave a comment or contact me privately regarding any detail that is missing or if you just want to share your own teardrop or small camper idea that makes the whole camping experience fun for you.\nEach of the thirteen steps ( plus another new 14th addition) that follow is a single step with its own page.

I was looking for an aluminum, diamond plate pattern, that would compliment the stone guard on the front of the trailer. This box measures 36\" X 18\" X 18\" and was the largest aluminum locking box I could fit onto the tongue without moving the battery.\nTo begin, a few deck-boards were attached across the a-frame and into the steel using self-driiling screws. The tongue box was then bolted to the boards using stainless steel bolts. Each drilled hole received a good dab of silicone prior to the box being bolted down.\nThe box holds camping gear that is too large for the galley or too dirty for the cabin as well as the power box (refer to the second last modification) for the exterior 12-volt LED lighting and 12-volt accessories. Power to the box is fed from the battery through a rubber gasket in the bottom of the tongue box. A 'marine grade' 12 volt receptacle was bolted to the outside of the box. All fasteners were stainless steel to minimize galvanic reactions with the aluminum. A series of eyebolts were fastened to the outside of the box (right front corner) to hold and organize the safety chains and trailer wiring plug. A hub bearing dust cover fits over the wiring plug when not in use to keep out dirt and rain.

This is the end that is used to access the poles. The other end of the tube has an end cap that is also removable. The end cap is held in place using a bolt cut to length and a cotter pin.

The plywood was stained and coated with several applications of spar varnish. Next, the edges were trimmed with one inch bright aluminum banding, attached using stainless steel screws.\nThe mounting rail was cut in half into 15\" lengths. The two pieces of rail allow for me to attach the table to the sidewall of the camper in one of two configurations, long or narrow. Again, I used stainless steel screws to attach the rail to the camper, placing silicone into the holes before screwing the rail on.\nThe support leg was made from a repurposed staircase spindle cut to length. It needed a little whittling to fit snuggly into a door bumper on the underside of the table, which holds it in place.\nAluminum table mounting rail is sold in 30\" sections and can be cut to any length. It's a two piece system. One piece mounts on the camper wall, one on table. The table slides on and off.

The box was attached to a half shelf inside the tongue box. Power to the tongue box was fed from the battery through a rubber gasket in the bottom of the tongue box and then through a hole in the side of the wooden power box. A 5 amp inline fuse was inserted between the battery and the box.\nI picked up the small plastic distribution panel at a surplus electronic store for fifty cents which made some of my connections simpler and bit more organized. A few connections were soldered and tape wrapped.\nI had decided earlier to add LED lighting to the underside of the camper and strip strip to the awning. The strips are 5 volt USB plugin and so I simply inserted a USB /12 V adapter into the 12 V receptacle and plugged in the lights after setting up camp. The toggle and remote then control the lights. By using a remote control feature I could turn the exterior lights on when returning to the camper at night. That's what the rectangular black unit is in the picture. The remote feature (using a fob) is good for 70\u2019 and was purchased at Princess Auto.

Although I would have preferred the automotive type, the power draw is significant, they take up more space and the wiring and location of the speakers is an additional consideration. This model is quite small and the speakers are integrated into the unit. Three wires only, power, ground and ignition.\nThe unit is designed to fit between the handle bars of a bike. And so, I needed to come up with an idea for hanging and attaching the radio to a pair of tubes suspended under the galley shelf. My solution was to use 3/4 inch copper tubing fittings, soldered to accommodate the angles of the clamps that are part of the radio. The copper pieces became the handle bars as such.

So, instead of it being broken into chunks of like items, it is in chunks as It progressed chronologically. i.e. Each block of time I worked on it I jumped around to different things. It's written that way. It's sequenced in the way I worked on it.\nAlso, In my quest to be as economical as I can and a definite awareness that I don't know everything, I'm sure there are alternative ways of accomplishing some the the things I've done. But, at this time, these were my solutions to the way to get it done.\nLong ago, I published and instructable here called \"The incredible soda bottle pontoon boat\". That was in 2006. In the instructable, I updated it later on to show improvements and in the last entry, it's demise, as I dismantled it after a number of years.\nWell, I've done it again. This time it's different. As much as I liked the \"barge\" as we called it. It was like a floating island that moved at about 2 mph. We enjoyed it though, and it was fast enough for trolling. This new endeavor is svelter. I don't think it will go much faster but will move with fewer batteries and fewer electric motors.\nI've been looking for a larger sailing catamaran for a few years. I checked craigslist often. What I was looking for was two fold. One, an 18 ft or longer catamaran. Lots of 16 ft ones around but I wanted more buoyancy. Two, I preferred a 'fixerupper'. I preferred something older but in good floating shape. Maybe with missing sails or hardware like the mast. I would rather repurpose something that would probably never be used as a sailboat again instead of cannibalizing something good. I looked at a few like this but they were in too bad a shape to put effort into. Structurally unsound. Eventually I found a catamaran that was old but in pretty good shape in Cape Cod. A 1971(ish) 18 ft Solcat. Not made any longer. And, the price was better than excellent. The disturbing news was that it had all hardware/accessories in tact. It could have been refurbished as a sailing catamaran. Being a bit older and having looked a fair amount of time, I decided I would repurpose it for 'me'.\nOne thing about the Solcat is that it was a bit heavier than catamarans later on. This was a plus. Lots of catamarans today have thin hulls to keep the weight down. Nice for sailing, but they can lose integrity after awhile. This Solcat is sort of a beast. The hulls were intact, had been painted a couple of times, and had a couple of soft spots on the decks. Nothing too bad though. There was also some minor delamination where the deck crimped over and connected with the hull.

This gave me better access to the business side. After a ton of sanding using a rotary sander with a course grit sandpaper any holes and major dings were taken care of with body filler.\nUsing body filler on these pontoons could be a mixed blessing. I didn't want to get out the fiberglassing stuff. Messy and there weren't any major cracks. I settled on body filler but I decided to use it conservatively. The pontoons will give with pressure. They are a bit flexible. Body filler isn't. I did have some deeper scratches and a couple of gouges but putting larger spreads of body filler might prove problematic. It can be brittle. If the filler cracked, it might even chip down the road. Since the pontoons were 44 years old and although in good shape, they have seen some wear. I decided to not go overboard trying to smooth them out in fear of overdoing it and having the filler chip off later on. When things where dry I used my Random orbital air sander to smooth it down using 240 grit paper. The sanding dust was washed off with a power washer and the pontoons wiped down with a damp rag of xylene to remove any other residue.\nI used Rust Oleum marine above deck primer and paint. They do make a below waterline paint but researching online I found that in fresh water, the topcoat is plenty durable. And it comes in better colors and is much less expensive. Even though, the color choices weren't too agreeable to me. I decided on the navy blue. The royal blue was to, well, blue. The other colors weren't on my radar of what I wanted. I'm hoping it's durable enough. I'll be taking the boat out each fall so I'll be able to touch things up if need be.\nThe primer went on with great difficulty. I was using an HVLP sprayer with an 80 gallon compressor. This primer must be very good. Even though I had it shaken in the store a day before, when I opened the primer it was almost like putty with a one inch oil layer on top of it. Stirring the quart can was nearly impossible. I was going to thin it with xylene but first I needed to get it out of the can at least a little stirred. After breaking a couple of stirring sticks I had made I took an old 7/8\" spade drill bit and ground off all the points and sharp edges. I used it as a paint stirrer in my cordless drill. After awhile I got the primer to pour but it was thick and lumpy. After straining it the best I could I added about 5% xylene to the quarter of a quart I poured into a can and stirred it some more. While spraying I had to clean the gun at least six time before the primer coat was on both pontoons. This was a very difficult process. The only solace regarding this is that the primer must have lots of solids. So, it will probably stick good.

It was thick and creamy and after thinning with about 5% xylene, it sprayed very nicely. The first spraying, it actually was pretty much a dusting. The second coat the next day filled in the color more. The third coat finished the job after a very light sanding to take off any roughness.\nI must say that the gloss of the topcoat does show any imperfections more than the flat primer did.

I determined this by leveling the trailer and subsequently the forward end of the pontoons. The back half sweeps downward. I was not quite sure just how low in the water the back end would be so I decided to attempt to level the deck by raising the back end of it 5 1/2 inches.\nI did this by cutting off sixteen inch pieces of 2x6\" framing lumber and sandwiching it between two pieces of plywood. After a bunch of exterior teflon coated deck screws it will be very stable.\nThe wood chosen was pressure treated lumber. The big box stores are loaded with it here especially in early spring like it is now. Everybody uses it as it holds up to Maine winters (and summers). The good qualities are it will never rot in the application I'm using it for. It's not expensive (I'm constantly trying to keep costs down, it's a thing with me), and it's strong. The downsides? Well, it's heavier than regular framing lumber. They use southern yellow pine and it's wet with the compounds they infuse it with. It will dry over the summer and get a lot lighter, but a standard spruce 2x4 that they sell around here feels like styrofoam compared to this stuff.\nThe deck, at this stage consists of ten and twelve footers. I will be cutting them to make a more rounded five facetted front. It will hang out over the end three feet at the maximum point which is the center of the deck.\nI originally wanted to attach the floor to the cross beams with very large 4\" and 5\" U-bolts. I was going to bolt a galvanized angle Iron piece to one side of the 2x4 just above the cross beam then mount a U-bolt under the cross brace and into the angle iron. That would have really snugged it down. I still think this is the best idea but after looking at the cost of all of the hardware for this, eight sets, front and back the cost would have been between $80 and $100, so I looked for another alternative.\nAt the box stores they have lots of galvanized straps in the lumber area. They are fairly bendable. I found that by attaching them to the wood and saving the inside screws as the last ones, it pulled the straps snug against the pipe, almost like a clamp. Each of the joists is tight. I might still put a couple of U bolts in the back, just for luck. Not sure yet.\nThe end joists present their own problems. I want them close to the ends of the cross beams but there's no place for a strap. I'm toying with the idea of loosening the beam bolt that attaches it to the pontoon and slipping a thin strap under the beam, then screwing it to the wood like the others.

It\u2019s pretty much all we\u2019re are using around here now for outside paint. It seems to last longer than anything else we\u2019ve tried. Didn\u2019t use it for a long time because it costs about half of other good brands. Whodathunk it was so good.\nThe veneer plywood is put on with galvanized finish nails (nail gun whenever possible). I used some filler on the small holes. Later on I\u2019ll put another coat of paint on to cover them and make it look flatter. On the back piece I used screws as it is also structural to hold the floor beams in place better. I also cut the contour of the front and have two of the veneers drying on plywood at this time. I\u2019ll assemble them onto the boat tomorrow.\nAlso, my bilge pumps came in today from Amazon. I\u2019ve got two. One for each pontoon. Now I think the pontoons have pretty good water integrity but they aren\u2019t like a fiberglass ski boat. The walls are much thinner, made that way to keep the weight down for sailing. If I were to get even a small hole in one it would fill with water and not be good. The pontoons are built with about 50% styrofoam in each one, but that\u2019s only to keep the boat afloat should it tip over while sailing. It\u2019s no longer a sailboat. I need it to float. Not \u2018just\u2019 stay above water. Each bilge pump is submersible in water waterproof electrical fittings. I\u2019m going to assemble a tube in each of the rear top screw on caps at the back end of each pontoon. You can see the caps in one of the pictures above. The tube will attach to the output of the pump that\u2019s in the pontoon. Two wires will also extrude from the cap and lead to switches in the console. The pumps shoot water as fast as a water hose. I\u2019ve seen them in action. So, unless I get a big hole in the bottom I should be able to make it home, or at least to shore before going under. Of course the pumps will also be good to bail any incidental water that gets into the pontoons over time. A pontoon isn\u2019t an open boat, so bailing with a bucket isn\u2019t an option.\nSecond day on this part and after finishing the veneer, filling the nail holes and it's finished. I also installed the center pipe for wiring.\nI also installed four galvanized angled brackets to the edge joists. I couldn't put a strap because the crossbeam was on the pontoons.

I'm assuming the pontoons are pretty well sealed but I want the option of draining them without having to get in there with a cup to do it. These pontoons do have a drain plug in the back end of each one so I assume that water somehow does seep in.\nWhen I go to Lowes or Home Depot and I'm building something like a boat, all I see is potential boat parts. Here I found this expansion fitting It is threaded on one end and the 3/4\" pipe extends in or out and has two sealed o-rings. I needed to extend about 8\" to the bottom of the pontoon. This would allow me to extend it till the pump sat in the bottom of the pontoon.\nI drilled into the pontoon screw in cap and mounted the threaded part of the extension through the opening and screwed the fitting on the top side of it with silicon in between to seal it. After mounting an elbow to the lower end then bilge pump will be connected to it using a very short length of rubber hose and clamps. The top extends, via a 3/4\" pvc pipe 9\" long to an elbow. This top extending elbow will be positioned aft to expel water in the wake.\nAnother small hole in the cap will contain a 1/2\" pvc pipe and elbow.

Good and not so good. Floatation was pretty good. When I got on it it still was fine but when I moved to the rear of the platform the rear of the pontoons move down near water level.\nI had anticipated the possibility of this. Yes, yes, I know that I used some heavy wood on the platform, but honestly, I built it to try to balance cost, weight, and stability. I wasn't going to spring for aluminum and regular wood would be rotted out here in Maine after a couple of years. The pressure treated wood was used as sparingly as possible. And, it has yet to completely dry which will alleviate some of the weight. All plywood is 1/2 inch with joists spread apart a bit.\nSo, it could work okay this way. The pontoons are sound and sealed. But, I'd like a little more buoyancy. I anticipated this possibility. I've seen a guy on Youtube make a smaller catamaran conversion and he added a plastic Kayak down the center. I've had one bookmarked from Walmart for awhile in case I needed one. It's 8.6 feet and has a weight capacity of 295 lbs. and the price is fairly good. I don't know if it's a good Kayak, doesn't matter as I just need it as a third pontoon. So, (next day) we went over to the Walmart and picked up the Kayak. It's a sit on not a sit in, so it can't fill with water. It's basically a flat plastic tube with a dent in the top for your butt. I hoisted it up with ratcheting cargo straps then strapped it up with some nylon (the plasticy type, not the cloth type) strap and used screws to the deck to hold it in place. After I realized the cargo straps were the thing that was really binding it in place, so they stayed where they were. It's solid. Not much fun working beneath the boat but it got done.\nSince the plywood was dry I managed to get a coat of latex primer on the deck. It had been raining on and off and I've been waiting for it to day.\nAlso of note, I welded together some extended guides like on pontoon boat trailers. I mounted them then covered them with PVC pipe to prevent them scratching the pontoons. I needed these as the rear of the boat would wander when I tried to put it on the trailer. When I last did the test launch it worked great. Also, I had one side roller missing. It was missing when I bought it. So I again welded up a roller mount and since I didn't have any hard rubber tube but did have some swim noodles. I fashioned a section of noodle for a roller. It works and will probably last long enough. I can just replace it for about a buck.\nNote: I also temporarily mounted the motors on the frame I welded up for them. This was to get measurements for the steering mechanism. These motors are two of four I had when I had built the soda bottle pontoon boat years ago.

It's a light grey and should compliment the blue/white colors of the rest of the boat. After it was dry I put the edging on the deck. Again, trying to keep costs manageable I opted for a double piece of vinyl siding trim. By using two of them inserted one inside the other I managed to get a double rolled over look. The added advantage is that they come 12 feet long and are available at big box stores. As you can see in a couple of the pictures, I fit them together in a way they weren't met to fit together. The idea came when I looked at them in the store. Seems they ship doubled up like this. It looked good so voila. I used a hair dryer on high to bend them to the shape of the deck. I installed the top one first using pan head screws then laid down some clear silicone with a caulk gun and pressed the other piece in place from the bottom up. Masking tape is used to squeeze them together till the silicon dries.\nThe bimini top is a relic from my old pontoon boat (see link in first step of this instructable). It's a little too big. Years ago my sister sewed it up for me. Good job with basting along the edges and all. It's Sunbrulla. A brand type that was a bit pricey but supposed to be fairly impervious to a lot of things, UV, mold, etc. It was out and up for eight years in the weather and you can see the shape it's in. I'll have my other sister alter it later.\nI welded up two brackets to hold the poles. The brackets are mounted with lag screws and bolts to the center of the right and left edge of the deck. From the brackets three poles will rise. One facing aft, one vertical, and the other facing forward. It will become clearer when I actually raise them and slide the canopy on them. I had this setup on my first boat so I know it works.\nOff tomorrow to purchase nine 1\" galvanized metal electrical conduit pipes, elbow sweeps and a few other items to get this made.

I wasn't looking for spectacular sound or quality, just some radio tunes and maybe something from an SD card. Alas, I should have known. I probably had a 50/50 chance of it working out. It didn't. DOA when I tried it out. Something with the multiple wire socket I think. possibly it's the soldering on the circuit board. I managed to get it to flicker a couple of times then gave up after trying to work on it.\nI had in my possession a small class D receiver/amplifier I had toyed with a year ago. It had amazingly good sound for it's small size, is stereo, and will take an SD card or USB drive. After connecting it to the automobile speakers and powering it temporarily, I found that it worked and worked well. A couple of machine bolts and it was installed. I cut the 12volt connector off an old dead power brick and wired it to a fused port in the console. Pretty good sound. More volume than I should use on the water and I get all the local FM stations any other radio gets around here. And, I paid about $20 for it. It's much better quality than the car radio.\nThe radio is housed in a marine radio cover. A flip down door protects the unit from the elements.\nI'm getting close to a launching date.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFT/7F22/JJ4JVEQM/FFT7F22JJ4JVEQM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG7/8FDM/JJ4JVEP9/FG78FDMJJ4JVEP9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLR/2XEV/JJ4JVERZ/FLR2XEVJJ4JVERZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ0/SMB6/JJ4JVETC/FQ0SMB6JJ4JVETC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHG/A841/JJ4JVETD/FHGA841JJ4JVETD.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 14: A Boat Name and Tunes"}, {"step": 15, "steps_text": "Today we launched. After taking two days to get a homemade boat registered in Maine I'm exhausted. I had to get a registration number (like a VIN for a boat). They issued one from the state department. Then I had to engrave the 12 digit number in two different but specific places. I had a dremel but my dremel penmanship isn't very good, then pictures of my work and calls to the state dept. Finally I got the number to put on the bow.\nThe launch went well. I don't have pictures of it because it was a busy day at the town boat ramp. People were lined up and waiting. It slid into the water nicely and the buoyancy was satisfactory. I had to leave the canopy retracted from the trailer ride to the ramp because we had a large road tunnel to go through to get to the main part of the lake were our home is. After that we raised it as the sun was pretty hot. I brought lawn chairs for myself and the wife.\nPerformance:\nI once had a heavy homemade pontoon boat with four electric motors. It was slow and lumbering but it got us there. The speed of a moderate walk. Good for touring and trolling. The Mermaid is lighter but it only has two electric motors. The same ones I used on the other boat. Half the weight but half the power. The result is about the same speed. Both boats don't do that good in a headwind. This one is lighter though and it's easily turned by the wind. And as luck would have it there were unusually heavy winds on when I launched it to drive it home.Nearly whitecaps on the water. And to add to that, to get home we had to head into the wind all the way. Home was north and the wind was coming in from the north. We hugged the shoreline where it was much calmer and did okay. This maiden voyage had clear waters in the video above.\nPeriodically I would check the level of the rear of the pontoons. They didn't seem to change. I also periodically turned on the pumps to see if any water would come out. It was dry. That's good news. I was hoping that I had sealed things up pretty good after all my efforts to do so. I'll keep an eye on it as it's docked over time to make sure I don't wake up to a partial submergence.\nThings I need to do:\nNothing is pressing to get done on this at this time. When I pull it out in the fall I plan on changing out one of the motors. I have four motors. Two that are long and two that are short. I used the short ones as if I had used the long ones they would have stuck up about two feet. The reason for these lengths is that I had removed the heads and cut them to fit under the previous boat I had made long ago. The two short ones fit on this boat nicely but one of the motors was somehow cut a bit shorter than the other. I have it as low as I can get it but when I sit in the middle of the boat it can cavitate as the boat rocks with waves. The end of the prop breaks the surface and sputters. Propulsion can't be good then. I'll have to cut down one of the long motors and mount it a few inches lower than the current one.\nI've ordered my second battery. I had only purchased one as it was all I needed to wire the thing and test it out both on land and the water. I had always planned on two batteries. I've learned from the past 'One battery used to go out and when that drains it's time to turn around and use the second battery to make it back'. While we were out today I timed it and we took about an hour and a half to get home. It's a six mile lake. The boat ramp isn't that far but the boat is slow and the lake is long. And that nasty, strong headwind most of the trip. How strong was it? A life preserver and my wife's hat blew backwards into the lake while traveling and it wasn't because we were going fast! The voltmeter is connected with a shunt across the negative terminal. It's designed to read under load. Today I end up, under load with a voltage reading of 11.67 volts. The current being drawn by the motors was about 41 amps with both motors running full. I've got a sealed 100 amp/hr AGM deep cycle battery. When I removed the load it jumped up to about 12.35 Volts. Good batteries. I've got one like it in my camper. I can't seem to discharge it much.\nThe linear actuator used for steering works really well. Not fast but fine if you're not going fast. I did notice that as the strong wind tried to catch the sides of the pontoons and turn us I had to continually correct and sometimes it was strong enough that I had to overcorrect to get it in the right direction. Calmer waters shouldn't present this issue.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9D/9W57/JJ8UBEEE/F9D9W57JJ8UBEEE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1B/MDS8/JJ8UBEEF/F1BMDS8JJ8UBEEF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 15: Launch: the Maiden Voyage"}, {"step": 16, "steps_text": "7/2017\nThe Mermaid goes good.

To score the hard lines, we placed a screw into the side of our miter box so the sharp point would be on the inside. Then, while holding the pipe firmly against the screw, we rotated each pipe inside of the miter box to score a deep gouge along the entire circumference of the pipe. It's best to rotate the pipe toward yourself so that you can match up to the initial score line as it comes back around on top of the pipe.

A few initial test pieces that were melted too much proved that to be a major requirement!\nUsing a piece of wood with a V notch cut into it kept the pipe centered and at a consistent distance from the heat gun's nozzle. We clamped this to an upside down wire basket from a chest freezer, ensuring the wood was back a bit from where the heat gun would be mounted. An old milk crate or other sturdy bin could have worked just as well.\nWe secured the heat gun to the wire basket by using several Velcro ties. These allowed the heat gun to be moved up and down to adjust the distance as needed for the different diameter pipes. The entire assembly was able to slide forward or backward along the work table, depending on the location of the node on the pipe.\nWe clamped a large dowel to a step ladder to support the other end of the pipe.

Lightly toasted marshmallow color is a good target, and the pipe will just begin to warp as well.\nObviously, the area you just heated is now hot. Hot things hurt, so be careful. Use your common sense. 'Nuff said.\nWhen the pipe just begins to bend at the heated area it is ready. (You can use a small amount of bending pressure as you're turning the pipe to help identify if it's ready). Remove the pipe from the jig, stand the pipe up vertically and use both hands to slowly but firmly push straight down until the heated area \"bumps\" out. You may need a to use your feet or knees to help hold the lower end of the pipe steady while using both hands above the heated area to push down with enough force. Hold the pressure to maintain the bump for about 5 seconds, and apply a wet rag to the hot area or use a spray bottle to speed the cooling process.

The stain also began rinsing off in the heavy rains we have here in the Pacific Northwest. This spring I experimented with a few paints for plastic, but settled back on using the original stain. I waited for a few hot sunny days and power washed off as much of the poly as I could, then re-stained the wall in place using a 4\" brush and the same stain.

From there, we used shear lashings, similar to that used in How to build a wooden tripod, but with only 3 wraps and a single frapping pass. Here is a short video. We also wrapped the pipes by using a loop of rope rather than passing the entire length between the pipes. Once we made 3 wraps, we pulled the slack of the rope from the bottom to snug the loops together and cover the threaded rod.

Put aside for now.\nMy endcap is divided into 4 segments already which would make it easy for me to find the centerpoints where I need to drill, yet I use the cut-out and my template to find and drill the first holes.\nI have a simple but handy draw-out on paper which helps me find exact positions for this. As the pictures show, I use the draw-out to find the center, put a big cross on it (connecting 4 equally spaced dots) and measure about 1cm back from the edge. Drill these out, flip it over and use the holes in the cut-out as a template for hole positioning in the endcap. You can draw dots through the holes or drill directly though into the endcap. This helps with lining up all the holes!\nUsing the 50mm holesaw we need to put a big hole in the endcap. Yes, in the middle! Save the small cut-out! We\u2019ll use it later on for the speartube!\nNow put the 1\u201d bolts through the lid, spacers in between, and the cut-out on top (use your marking for easy alignment) and using 4 locknuts locking the endcap/ draining system together.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: Draining System"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Tools and hardware;\n[Specific length of] 160mm PVC plumbing pipe\n[Specific length of] 50mm PVC plumbing pipe\nMiter box and saw\nSanding paper (120-180 grit)\nI always start out with measuring out my preferred lengths of tube and using a miter box making sure I get straight cuts (clean up edges after cutting). The pipe is 160mm in diameter and the length is totally up to you.\nMy width measurements are all based on the funnel; I found a very sturdy kitchen-funnel which fits exactly in a 160mm plumbing pvc tube, so that decided the width. If you have a bigger funnel which fits exactly in a slightly larger diameter pipe, then use it! Funnels are always the first thing to break when frequently lionfishing. Less messing with the funnel means it stays stronger.\nI don\u2019t advise going smaller in diameter as the BIG lionfish are already a struggle to get in. The one in this instructable is a small one, only 45cm (17,5\u201d). The end product will be about 65cm (26\u201d) which is good for about 6.5 \u2013 7kg of lionfish (up to 8 if jampacked!). The speartube can be cut shorter, mine is 33cm (13\u201d).\nplacement is something to consider before you start cutting and drilling. Main question being; \u201care you right or left handed?\u201d. I\u2019m shooting my spear with my right hand, so I want my window positioned on the left side. Otherwise the window would be facing inwards and not show to other divers along with me.\nIt wouldn\u2019t make sense placing my handle on the inside, I would have to reach into weird ways to be able to grab that handle. On the bottom wouldn\u2019t make sense either, obviously.\nI also like to have my speartube straight under my window (I usually bring a small second spear in case I nick a fish in the fin, then I\u2019ll grab that small second spear and plow it into them devilfish!).\nAll the items and holes depend on where your window is cut out, so we'll start with this one.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5B/L8RU/JJ8UDN7J/F5BL8RUJJ8UDN7J.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Tube"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Tools and hardware;\nElectric drill + both drillbits\nJigsaw\nSoldering gun\nLaminator + pouch + small picture\nRiveting gun + your 48 aluminum rivets\n[Specific length of] 160mm PVC plumbing pipe\nMeasuring tape and ruler\nPermanent marker/ sharpy\nA4 format paper\nSanding paper (120-180 grit)\nStanley knife / exacto blade\nCouple rubber bands\nI have a laminated template for all my holes and window cut-out. Here is a quick way of making one;\nGrab yourself an A4 paper and draw lines 1cm (3/8\u201d) away from the edges and another one 2cm (\u00be\u201d) away from the edges.\nRound off the corners (if you like) from both lines drawn. On the outer line measure out 48 holes equally divided (take the middlepoint of your outer line; measuring paper from end to end, mine is 29,7cm (just shy of 11\u00be\u201c) so half is 14,85cm (just over 5\u00be\u201d)). Mark and use this centerpoint, working your way outwards putting a dot every 2cm (\u00be\u201d) up to the 12cm (5\u201d) mark. Use this same method for the sides. When top, bottom, left and right are dotted, place a last dot in every corner in between the most outer dots. I got 13 on the top and bottom line, 9 on the left and right side and 4 additional dots in the corners making a total of 48 dots. Don\u2019t go any less! It makes the spacing between rivets bigger, potentially leaving room for a lionfish-spine to stick through!\nPoke through your dots with something pointy (small hole only! Use a dart or small nail).\nUse this as a template for putting all hole markings onto your tube. I usually put my template centered on the tube in between coupling and the bottom piece securing it with some rubber band to keep it from slipping.\nWhen all the dots are transferred to your tube (which will become the rivetholes), you can cut the outer rim off, following your inner drawn line. The leftover rectangle is the template for the actual window cut-out. So center this again inside all the dots on your tube and trace the rectangle with your sharpie to put that line on the tube too!\nWe can finally start cutting and drilling! I advise to start cutting the window first. Take your electric drill and the small 7/64\u201d drillbit and put 3 holes, as close to eachother as possible, along the drawn line. Poke through the leftover plastic so you can fit your jigsawblade through. Carefully cut the complete rectangle leaving a big hole in your tube.\nClean up the rough edges with sanding paper.\nYou can now also drill through all dots around the window hole using the 11/64 drillbit.\nI\u2019m using a laminator, so I can incorporate a small personal logo. The 125micron thickness is very sturdy but I also have successfully built it with 80micron which held up fine as well.\nYou can use the paper cut-out from the window to find the right positioning for your logo or picture (put it under the pouch and your logo inside the pouch in the corner). Now run it through the laminator creating your window!\nWhile positioning it over the window cut-out and securing it with rubber bands my soldering iron is already warming up. I always melt the holes through because it makes a stronger edge inside the hole. Do this in a well-ventilated area, preferably outside! Work from one side to the other and put a rivet in right after melting through your hole to keep your laminate in place. Be sure to wipe the excess plastic off of your solderingtip after every couple of holes!\nHopeyou have a strong forearm, this will take some strength!

You could just put a small endcap on the speartube, maybe sand it down flat so you have a straight connection with the tube and be done with it. Ahh a bit of PVC cement for good measure! Drill a reasonable hole in the middle, bolt it on the tube, et voila! The easier and faster way! (so maybe recommended) BUT\u2026\nRemember the 50mm plastic disk I told you to save (from the draining-endcap)? With a little heat and a piece of rope we\u2019ll re-use this little disk to a little \u2018tube-plug\u2019!\nStart off by cleaning up all the rough edges with a sharp knife or sanding paper. You can trim the disk down a little, but it needs to stay bigger as the opening of your speartube.\nNow slowly warm up the bottom 5cm (2\u201d)of your speartube above a stove or another way of controlled fire. If you have a heatgun use it! But I think the majority will be using some kind of controlled fire.\nDon\u2019t blacken the end, keep rotating and moving the tube in and out of the heat (so hold it ABOVE the fire, not IN the fire). It just needs to soften up, it doesn\u2019t need to melt! Don\u2019t joke around with plastics and fire! Use a well-ventilated area, preferably outside!\nWhen the end is softened up, put your disk on top pushing one side in. Using a pen or anything else but your finger, gently push the disk in and straighten it out. I suggest wearing a glove holding the tube just below the softened part (this way your hand works as an improvised stop for pushing in the disk to far), working in the disk with the other hand.\nRemember to leave enough room at the bottom to put a bolt through! 2cm (less then an inch) is enough. When happy with the placement I suggest pinching together the bottom part, below the disk. Now the disk is in there solid!\nYou can put a piece of rope through the hole with a knot. This way if the disk gets stuck sideways, and you can\u2019t grab it, you can pull it out using the rope!\nNote the in the video i put the rope in the wrong way... the cap goes into the into the softened part with the knot going in first, so you could actually pull the disk out if necessary!\nDrill2 holes, one on the top and one at the bottom (below the inserted disk) of the tube.\nStick the \u00bd\u201d bolts through the holes and lay it down on your tube (I\u2019m using the print on the tube as alignment). Mark the places the bolts poke out onto the tube, drill and fasten the 2 \u00bd\u201d bolts with locknuts.\nThinking back about \u201cplacement\u201d, I\u2019m connecting the speartube about 3cm (1\u00bc\u201d) below the rivet-row from the window.

I glue both sides with PVC cement and push them onto each other until I reach the rubber band. The rubber band also prevents it from sagging any further down while the glue sets.

If you can\u2019t find an exact fitting funnel-screwcapcoupling-combination you can use a bigger funnel and cut it to size, this works fine but is less sturdy as an exact fitting one. The black (oil) funnel in the picture is one that is cut to size.\nFirst off, I saw off about half of the bottom part of the funnel. I\u2019m also using a template in order to get the 8 holes needed in the right position. Marking a ring about 1 below the upstanding rim and using my template to divide the funnel into 8 equal parts.\nI drill these using the 7/64\u201d drillbit and use the soldering iron to just tap all holes on both sides (you could also push your solder through, making the hole a little bigger). This makes a reinforced edge around the hole. Using a ruler I put lines from holes towards the narrower part of the funnel.\nNow put your funnel us-side-down and with an exacto blade cut the diagonal parts first leaving the narrow part for last. Cut towards the holes following the lines but be oh so careful you don\u2019t accidentally, force your blade into the drilled and molten hole! Carefully cut into the hole following your drawn line not cutting anywhere else in the hole! I actually stop before I reach the hole and gently push it through when I passed 3 or 4 times.\nDon\u2019t force your blade through on the first pass, score it first so when you pass your blade a second and third time it has a path to follow.\nWhen you have 8 slots in your funnel, turn it around again and sit down, place the funnel in your lap more towards your knees instead of your crouch, holding onto it. Carefully cut the narrowest part of the funnel, from middle to bottom, following your drawn lines. Again, don\u2019t force your blade through on the first pass, score it first so when you pass your blade a second and third time it has a path to follow.\nBE CAREFUL!

Just drill 2 holes neatly aligned, pass your cord through and tie a big enough knot so it doesn\u2019t slip back out, even with substantial weight. A simple figure-eight knot is enough in my case.

Plz keep the spacing between rivets \u201cas close to each other as possible\u201d, at least don\u2019t go wider as the 2cm (\u00be\u201d) used in this instructable!\n\u00b7 No jigsaw; drill a quadrillion holes! All along the lines, as close to eachother as possible and poke through the left-over plastic using a knife (or anything really). You\u2019ll have a lot of rough edges to clean up tho\u2026\nYou can also use a figure-saw for the screwcap-cut-out.\nUse a close quarter hack saw for the window-cut-out, put the 3 holes in line and fit a hacksaw in. you\u2019ll have to drill holes on all 4 lines of your rectangle since using this way you probably can\u2019t get rounded corners, but those are purely esthetic anyway!\n\u00b7 No holesaw; If you don\u2019t have a holesaw you can use the biggest drill you have and drill lots of holes in between your fastening bolts, try putting in at least 12 or so. Divide them nicely and be sure not to get to close to your screwholes, I\u2019d leave at least 2cm or so (an inch) in between. For the cut-out see alternative for 'speartubecap'.\n\u00b7 No soldering gun; hold a nail (using isolated pliers) into an open flame, heat it up and melt away!\n\u00b7 No PVC glue; I used to use miniscrews and jamming techniques in order for all components to be changed or replaced. When using miniscrews, do check on the inside of your tube if they are not poking through too much, I tend to file them down and flat.\nYou can also use a (thicker than paracord) rope and jam all tube segments together with this rope in between, you\u2019ll be surprised how well this holds! Push in as far as possible.\n\u00b7 Heat sources; preferably use fitting endcap for the speartube to skip this heatingstep altogether. But using scraps means less trash and less costs!\nUse a portable camp stove, heatgun, kitchenstove, gel-based contained fires, alcohol stove etc.\n\u00b7 Nicer-finish screws; I usually use these screw-into-eachother type screws. They leave a very smooth finish inside your tube! A bit more expensive tho.\n\u00b7 Bringing a second spear; I have different length extra spears to exchange on my different length zookeepers. I normally strap a piece of strechcord/ shockcord around the neck of my tube. If your spear is longer than your zookeeper you can use a bungeecord; drill a small hole through the top of the speartube (close to the tube), hook and cringe the hook. You might also have to drill a small hole in the top of your spear.\n\u00b7 Same diameter funnel, bigger tube; use a connector cuff (diameterreductor).\n\u00b7 Bigger tube; If you go up to 200mm most lobster will fit too! Make sure you have a funnel that big!\n\u00b7 Cheaper and bigger handle; often use a gardenhose filled with thick nylon rope as a handle on my own zookeeper. For a 30cm handle, cut 60cm of thick rope. Take a thin, strong rope and tie it halfway around the thick rope, guide the thin rope through the gardenhose, create a hold-on and pull the thick rope (doubled) through the gardenhose. Drill (and melt through) the ends for screws to pass through. It holds way easier, under and above water!\n\u00b7 Clips; lots of options!\n\u00b7 Fixed clips position (or closed ring clips); double the rope and feed it through the opening of your clip, now feed your clip through the loop you just created. This works very well when diving.\n\u00b7 Speartube cap; preferably use fitting endcap for the speartube to skip the heatingstep altogether. But using scraps means less trash and less costs!\nlots of plastic alternatives. Some bottlecaps fit, or other kind of lids. Otherwise cut a disk from a bucketlid using a Stanley-knife.\n\u00b7 Screwdrivers; a small screwdriver (needs to fit inside the tube) can even be a loose screwbit.\n\u00b7 Small Bahco; for locking the nuts onto your bolts you also have multiple options. Pliers is only for grip, tighten with other side (screwdriver-side).\n\u00b7 Spacers; I use storebought nylon spacers, but you can use things like wallplugs, stacked nuts, stacked washers, electrical pipe (the yellow one), small blocks of wood with a hole drilled through, even the cut-offs from the funnel will do!

You can adjust your water height at this point, as it can be a bit awkward to do once everything is in the pond (and at a much deeper depth).\nOnce tested, remove the pump from the water. The open end of the cedar box should be facing the front; place the pump into the box so it rests on the bottom as shown. Add the piece of travertine onto the top of the box. Insert the fountain head nozzle through the holes in the top of the box and travertine and connect it into the pump.\nThe last step is to add a rubber gasket. This is simply a circle with the hole in the centre that sits on top of the travertine to cushion the concrete bowl and mitigate any vibration. It also helps seal around the hole in the bowl so the water doesn't leak out the bottom.\nAll of this pre-assembly is to test the fit and make sure it all works together.

Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are one of the most effective and low-cost ways to protect our oceans while making them more productive and financially profitable. Currently only about 3% of our ocean has strongly protected waters while scientists agree that 30% are necessary for a sustainable ocean. We have a long way to go to create more MPA, monitor and enforce them. The brief was presented by former NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco below.\n\"There is broad acceptance of \u201cgreen parks\u201d on land, but demonstrating positive impacts that ultimately effect nearby communities with \u201cblue parks\u201d remains a challenge.\nMPAs are constrained by three major factors in public opinion:\nLack of awareness about the low area coverage of MPAs;\nLack of knowledge and awareness of massive conservation benefits of fully protected MPAs;\nLack of knowledge and understanding that those benefits spill out to adjacent areas and help make the oceans more resilient.\nMPAs are further constrained by forces that impact their existence and efficacy:\nCommercial interests and small-scale fishers and communities who use the ocean now see MPAs as a negative, as a loss, and not an investment in the future;\nIn some communities, community-based management projects offer some respite for depleted ecosystems and populations, but they require clearly delineated rights, and may not scale beyond the community;\nReal-time monitoring and enforcement remains a critical challenge that while technology exists, action is much less frequent and politically\n\n1. LOCAL AWARENESS SYSTEM\nHow might we create tools and systems to not only raise local awareness of the (ecological, cultural, and financial) benefits of MPAs, but also make sure that the protected areas maintain a viable ecosystem with healthy populations of marine life?\n2. MONITORING & ENFORCEMENT\nWhat kinds of scalable tools and systems can accurately monitor and enforce the protection of MPAs in new ways, so that \u201cenforcement\u201d is not perceived as yet another reason for powerful lobbies to view MPAs as negative? What kinds of functions can these technologies help augment and improve the functions of policy makers and managers of MPAs?\n3. FINE-GRAIN MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING\nWhat are the tools and systems needed formulti- stakeholder sustainable use of MPAs (cultural, economic, and environmental)? How might we create tools to design MPAs like how terrestrial multi-use protected areas are designed \u2013 what are the ecologically relevant spaces, what are the spaces for multi-use, how do you design for both economic outcomes & protection of marine life?\"\nIn this slideshow, we explain why created this surface marine drone: to monitor Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and map coral reefs.

It's probably also worth checking the measurements for the corner braces/duct reducer holes to make sure they're correct for your particular corner braces.\nFYI: The lid diagram/template image can be downloaded here, but make sure you measure it out/verify it if you plan to print it and use as as a reference.

Ensure the lid is secured tightly and let the blades do the work - don\u2019t push down forcefully while you\u2019re drilling with it (i.e. BE SAFE.) Nuff said.\nAs far as setting up the width on the hole saw - if you've downloaded and printed the PDF template and it came out to scale, you can use that as a reference to go off. Otherwise, your best bet/easiest bet would be a good caliper that does millimeters and inches. If you end up making the center hole *slightly* bigger than recommended, it's not a huge deal - but make sure you stay under 5\" so that the exhaust port/duct reducer will completely cover the hole.\nOnce you've made the hole, it's a good time to check it against your fan before we move on. Center your fan under the hole, and make sure that the lid isn't covering any of the fan blade area, but that it's also just wide enough not to have much of a gap between the fan chassis and the edge of the hole.\nAfter the exhaust hole is looking good, you can place the template on the lid and use it as a reference for your mounting holes. Cut out the area where the center hole/exhaust hole is on the diagram, and line that up with the actual hole on the bucket lid. Securely tape the corners of the reference to the bucket lid using masking or packing tape so that it doesn't come off when you start drilling.\nBefore you drill the holes for the corner braces/duct reducer mounts, you might want to check to make sure that the actual holes on the corner braces match up with the template. If they look good, go ahead and drill them holes.\nAfter you've drilled the corner brace holes, drill one of the mounting holes for the fan, and then use that to make sure that you can run a bolt completely through the lid hole and the fan chassis/mounting hole.\nYou might need to bore out the chassis holes on the fan if they're not wide enough.\nIf the fan's chassis holes are all good, drill one of the adjacent fan mounting holes, then run bolts through the lid and fan chassis for both fan holes you've made so far.\nMake sure your fan is all centered up with the exhaust hole. If that's all good to go, drill the remaining two holes and then move on to the hole for the DC connector.\nOnce your lid is all set, just make sure everything is disconnected from it for now.\nNext, we\u2019ll drill the ventilation holes in the bucket.\nI usually go with 2\u201d holes with .25\" padding on either side of each hole, but you may need to make smaller holes based on the size of your bucket or your personal taste.\nSo, here we go:\nMeasure 1.75\" below the bottom of the rim (the raised part near the top of the bucket that the handle is bolted into.)\nMark that point with your sharpie. This is the center point of the first row.\nMeasure the circumference of your bucket using your twine/string/measuring tape. (On my bucket, this came out to ~35\")\nIf the circumference of your bucket is ~35\" at the point we marked, you're in luck - we can just divide that by 2.5 and get a nice clean number - 14. If not, refer to the note some people need to do for row #2/subsequent rows.\nMark a 2.25\" interval somewhere on your twine, or use measuring tape and carefully mark your 14 spots around the bucket.\nOnce you\u2019re finished, make sure that all of the points are the appropriate distance from each other and level, as these will be the reference for the next row of holes.\nMark a point directly between two of the marks you just made for the first row, 3.75\u201d below the bottom of the rim. This will be the first point of the second row.\nIf you're using an HD bucket, the width/circumference of the bucket should about the same all the way down.\nIf so, make another set of 14 marks. Sad Note: If you're not using an HD bucket (or identical type) or your bucket is angled/funky, you might have to make a google math detour at this point and research \"how do I find the largest number I can divide into another number.\" in order to find the amount of holes per row.\nYou could do a third row of holes, but make sure that you leave at least a 3.5-4\u201d gap between the bottom of your ventilation holes and the bottom of the bucket for water, otherwise you might have to refill your swamp cooler a lot more often than you\u2019d like.\nOnce all of your future ventilation hole spots are marked, go ahead and 2\" hole saw away.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFU/8C3X/JIOUDQQA/FFU8C3XJIOUDQQA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHP/MU0H/JIOU4UYE/FHPMU0HJIOU4UYE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBF/IKHL/JIOUDNOO/FBFIKHLJIOUDNOO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIH/UICU/JIOU4UVN/FIHUICUJIOU4UVN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Bucket and Lid Prep"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Let\u2019s start by cutting the cooling pad to size. If you're using an orange HD bucket, then go ahead and cut your pad to 12\" (high) by 32.5\" (wide).\nIf you're using a different kind of bucket, find its circumference and subtract about 3\" to start with for the width you should cut your pad. Do a test fit and cut it down if necessary until it fits as described below. As far as height, the top of your pad should be about 2-3\" below the rim of the bucket.\nAfter the pad is cut to size, do a test fit in the bucket. Make sure you have a nice 2\u201d or so gap between the top of the pad and the rim of the bucket. As far as width, the pad should be snug against the walls of the bucket, and the ends shouldn\u2019t overlap. If your pad fits well, go ahead and leave it in the bucket if you like.\nNext we'll get your tubing in order.\nFirst, we'll cut the \"main\" tube that will lay on top of the pad and hydrate it. If you have an HD bucket, cut a length of tube to 32.75\" long. If not, cut a length of tubing to the circumference of the bucket. Place one of the \"arm\" barbs of the plastic tee in one of the ends of the tube. Run the tube around the bucket back to the other barb of the tee, mark where the point where the tube would come to on the tee once attached, and cut it to that length.\nOnce you\u2019re done, connect the tube to the \u201carms\u201d of tee and you should have sort of a tube \u201chalo\u201d that will run snugly along the inner wall of the bucket, and sit atop the pad.\nNow, we\u2019re just gonna put in some fluffy little irrigation holes... I use a \u215b\u201d drill bit for this operation, but you could use an awl, a nail, or any other object with a sharp, pointy end - just make sure you don\u2019t punch through both walls of the tube. Measuring out from the edge of one of the barbs in the tube and make a hole every 4\u201d or so the entire way around the tube. Once you're done with that, you can test it by running water from a faucet through the tube into your sink. Water should flow easily out of the holes.\nIf you\u2019re happy with your holes, twist the tube if necessary to point all of the holes downwards so that they\u2019re facing the same way as the \"trunk\" barb of the tee. Once the \"tube halo\" is installed in the bucket, both the tee \"trunk\" and those holes will be facing downwards.\nNext, we\u2019ll cut the tube that will connect our pump to the tube halo we just made. For our HD bucket readers - this tube will be 1'. For everyone else:\nPlace your pump on the bottom of the bucket. Measure from the top of the pump to the base of the tee, with the tube halo laying on the pad.\nCut the tube to the proper length, and insert one end into the \"exhaust\" barb of the pump (some pumps have an up arrow near it, or place the sticker behind it). Insert the other end into the tube halo. The intake/horizontal barb on the pump (the barb that's parallel with the power wires) should be parallel with the bottom of the bucket, so that it can get to that last bit of water if your bucket runneth low. If the tube length and all that stuff was fine, remove the pump from the tubing and set it aside for wiring later.\nFinally, we\u2019ll cut off a length of ducting that will get the swampy air from the cooler into your camping domicile. I\u2019m not even an HVAC novice, much less an expert, but I believe keeping it as short as possible is the way to go, so that the cool air has less distance to travel through the ducting before it gets to the inside of your tent. Ergo, if you know where on your tent/structure the vent tubing will be coming in, you could measure or guesstimate the length of ducting you\u2019ll need to go from the exhaust port/duct reducer to the inside of your tent.\nPersonally, I use a 3\u2019 length of ducting to run from MechaSwampy 2.0 into one of the inlets of my ShiftPod and it works pretty well.\nTo cut the ducting, you can use your scissors to cut the foil area, but you will need your wire cutters or potentially bolt cutters to cut the \"frame\" wire inside the ducting.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FU6/S3TL/JIOU4UV8/FU6S3TLJIOU4UV8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQL/CKHX/JIOU4UVL/FQLCKHXJIOU4UVL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2U/G6BS/JIOU4UYI/F2UG6BSJIOU4UYI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Preparing the Cooling Pad, Tubing and Ducting"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "We\u2019ll start by wiring up the DC connector. First, cut a 12\u201d length of red hookup wire for your positive line, and a 12\u201d black wire for your ground. Strip about \u00bc\u201d on one end of each wire, and 1\u201d on the other end. From the pictures you may notice that I used brown hookup wire for both - well, all I can say in my defense is that the author is a cheap scoundrel who only had brown wire laying around, and I have faith you can do better than me. I believe in you.\nDetermine which of the (usually 3) posts on the back of the connector connects to the (positive) pin, and which connects to the (ground) tab.\nIf you\u2019ve never wired up a connector before, don\u2019t worry - it\u2019s not too hard: with the multimeter in continuity or resistance/ohms mode, place one lead on the pin inside the connector, while taking care not to touch the metal \u201ctab\u201d inside the connector (the shiny part adjacent to the pin in the picture of the connector), and place the other lead on one of the posts in the back. If the multimeter reads zero and/or beeps, that post is connected to the pin and is the \u201cpositive\u201d post. If not, try one of the other posts.\nIt may help keep things orderly if you put a mark next to the \u201cpositive\u201d post, and/or solder it\u2019s wire on immediately so you don\u2019t mix them up later. Use the end of the of the wires where you only stripped about \u00bc\u201d for connecting to the DC connector. The other end of the wire with the longer exposed area will be used later to connect the pump and the fan.\nRepeat the same process to identify the \u201cground\u201d post, except instead of measuring the pin in the center of the connector, you\u2019ll measure from the tab inside the connector to the posts in the back without touching the pin.\nOnce you\u2019ve soldered both of the wires onto the posts, verify that they\u2019re connected to the right connections inside the connector using the multimeter to read from the exposed ends of the wires back to the pin and tab in the connector. If everything is copacetic, heat shrink the wires to both posts individually and then, using a larger piece of heat shrink, run both wires through it and use it to heat shrink both wires together and to cover the back of the connector as well as you can. Most solder nowadays is non-toxic, but it\u2019s a good idea to cover up the back of the connector and the ends of the wire, as they\u2019ll be inside the bucket and exposed to moisture.\nNow we need to connect the pump and the fan. First we\u2019ll connect the fan, as it\u2019s the closest to the power connector. Start by clipping off the plastic connector on the fan. Gently separate the wires.\nTypically, I cut the blue wire so that it only extends about 2\u201d from the fan, then I fold it back about an inch and completely heat shrink over the folded section to prevent any contact, as we won\u2019t need it for swamp cooling purposes. Strip the red (positive) and black (ground) wires about \u00bc\u201d.\nOrient the black wire from the fan so that it\u2019s running the same direction as the black wire from the power connector, or, laying on top of it, so that we can set up all of our heat shrink once we attach the fan. Solder the wires together as close to the shielded section of the black wire coming from the power connector as possible [picture] so you have room to connect the pump later. Repeat for the red wire.\nNext we\u2019ll get all of the heat shrink for the components set up, then finish up by soldering in the pump. Consider my heat shrink measurements approximate. If you stripped a little too much of the insulation on the power cables/had a solder malfunction/etc, you might need to use heat shrink that\u2019s bigger and/or longer. Too much is definitely better than not enough, especially in this case.\nCut about an inch and a half long piece of ~0.5\u201d heat shrink and run both of the pump\u2019s power wires through it. Slide it down near the pump for now, so that the heat shrink isn\u2019t affected when we solder the pump\u2019s wires to the power connections. This heat shrink will enclose both power wires and should comfortably cover the entire exposed section of the wires from the DC connector. If you\u2019d like an additional layer of heat shrink, go ahead and add another piece of wide heat shrink at this point.\nCut two half inch long or so pieces of ~1/8\u201d heat shrink, and slide them over each of the wires coming from the pump. These pieces of heat shrink should be long enough that they\u2019ll cover the the exposed section of the wires coming from DC connector, and the solder connections for the fan and the pump.\nOnce the heat shrink is all ready to go, we just need to solder the pump\u2019s power wires to the ends of the DC connection wires, and then we can finish up.\nMost of these pumps are made with fairly long power wires, and they should comfortably reach up to the top of the bucket with the pump sitting on the bottom. Strip about \u00bc\u201d off the end of each wire. For those of you who aren\u2019t familiar with standard wiring colors - usually these pumps will have a red wire and a red/black wire. Red is the positive wire, and red/black is ground.\nOnce you\u2019ve soldered the pump to the DC wires, you can (carefully) test the pump and fan by connecting the power supply. The power supply I have listed in parts comes with a variety of connectors, and has reversible connections, so it can be handy for other devices and for troubleshooting as well. Once you attach the appropriate connector [connector description], go ahead and plug it into the DC connector and then into your power source/outlet.\nYou should hear the pump vibrating, and the fan should start blowing. If one or the other doesn\u2019t turn on, make sure you didn\u2019t accidentally reverse the connections on the offending component (i.e. soldering a positive power wire to the DC ground wire), and that your solder connections are good. As I mentioned, the power supply I recommend also has a reversible connection, so if you reverse it and your stuff works - then the connections on your DC connector are backwards. I leave it up to you if you wanna fix it, or roll with it at that point. Finally, you could just be using a connector that\u2019s slightly too small for your DC connector, so just make sure to try the next one up.\nIf the pump and fan are both working, disconnect them immediately, as it\u2019s not good for the pump to run while it\u2019s not pumping anything.\nOnce you\u2019re electrically all good, go ahead and heat shrink the individual wires, and then use that larger heat shrink to wrap it all up. At this point, there should be no exposed wire, and the large piece of heat shrink should extend a little bit past the smaller pieces of heat shrink on either side of the wires.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6G/0SMG/JIOU4UVA/F6G0SMGJIOU4UVA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX1/9AGG/JIOU4UVI/FX19AGGJIOU4UVI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJG/QAY1/JIOU4UYJ/FJGQAY1JIOU4UYJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9K/LK3C/JIOU4UVG/F9KLK3CJIOU4UVG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Soldering Stuff/Wiring"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "At this point, you should have:\nYour bucket, with pad inserted\nLid, with holes for the duct reducer, mounting holes for the fan, and hole for the DC connector.\nPlastic tubing \u201chalo\u201d, and tube for the pump connected to the tee.\nPump, Fan, DC Connector, all wired together.\nDuct reducer with L-brackets attached to its sides.\nStart by connecting the fan to the lid.

I'll address what I think are the most common and workable options, and describe how you would go from there. Please note, I am not suggesting any one power source/product over another. I will say, unless you have a ton of other stuff to power, a gas-powered generator is massive overkill for this, but beyond that - it's your call.\nIf you'll be using solar power, make sure that the panel you use can reliably produce at least 60 Watts of power for at least 4-5 hours during the day.\nCommercial/\"Off The Shelf\" Solar Power (what the author uses): I have an all-in-one solar battery/controller that I use with a 100W solar panel. The solar battery/controller unit has a 3-prong North American 112 VAC outlet which I plug the power supply (listed in the parts section) into. If this is similar to what you'll be using, get the power supply I listed (or any other good 60W 12VDC power supply) and you'll be good to go. My unit has an on/off button for the AC outlet, so that's what I use to turn the swamp cooler on/off from inside my tent. If your power unit doesn't have a button, you'll need to manually insert/remove the power cable to turn the swamp cooler on/off.\nDIY Solar: A cheaper, yet perfectly viable option for powering these. You will need a solar panel, charge controller that will output 12VDC, and deep cycle 12V marine battery. Setting that up is beyond the scope of this article, but *instead* of buying the power supply in the parts listing for the swamp cooler, we'll just be making a DC power cable like so:\nGet a Male DC Connector/Plug. Ensure that it fits well into the Female DC Connector you purchased.\nMake sure you have an additional 3-6+ feet of Red and Black wire (or more specifically - enough to make a cable that goes from your swamp cooler to where the charge controller is stationed), and enough shrink wrap for another connector. I would also consider electrical tape, zip ties, cable ties, or a cable sleeve for keeping the two wires together for safety/trip hazard elimination purposes.\nSolder the wires to their appropriate counterparts. (If you buy a male DC \"plug\", they usually have black and red wires connected to the connector, and you'd just to solder wire to wire. If you buy a \"connector\" it will likely just be the connector, and then you'll need to identify the posts similarly to how you did for the female connector for this swamp cooler.)\nI would definitely heat shrink both red and black wires, heat shrink them together, and potentially do an additional layer of heat shrink. But keep the length down to 3/4\" at most so that the wires have some flexibility near the connector(s).\nSecure the wires together using your zip ties/cable ties/tape/etc for the length of this power cable back to the solar charge controller.\nThe bare power and ground wires will plug into the solar charge controller. Typically, there is a set of connections with a light bulb or fan symbol above them on most charge controllers where you'll plug these wires into.\nTo turn the swamp cooler on/off, you'll have to manually plug/unplug the power cable from the swamp cooler, unless you add a switch to the cable.\nGas-Powered Generator: In addition to being an overkill option (most of them easily produce 200W+) this is also the loudest and riskiest option. If you are planning to power this cooler with one - make sure the generator is far, far away from where this swamp cooler will be sucking in air. That said, here's what you'd need to do:\nIf the generator has a 3-prong North American 112 VAC outlet, buy the power supply listed in the parts, and a super long extension cable.\nIf the generator only has DC outlets (e.g. the \"cigarette lighter\"/auto DC connectors) I would try to find a very long DC Male-to-Female auto cable, cut off the female connector, and solder on a male DC barrel connector, similar to the DIY Solar power cable.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 7: A Word on Power"}], "channel": "Camping"}, {"category": "Outside", "description": "A disc wheel gives you about 1minute advantage over the bike course of an Olympic triathlon (40km).

For example if you to fill a space with 2 planks use the golden ratio or radical of 2, 3 to decide on the length (width) of those pieces.

For a single seat, the boat may be around 10-15 feet long, and for a two person boat, it may be anywhere from 14-17 feet long. If you plan to add seats like a canoe, the depth of the hull will be around 12-16 inches, while a kayak hull is closer to 10 inches or less in depth. This article from PaddlingLight by Bryan Hansel has a good explanation for calculating seat positions. The seat positions will also drive the overall length of your canoe depending on how much leg room you desire. I chose to make my canoe around 11 feet long so that I could use standard 12 foot cut boards. This decision also confined me to a single seat adult or two seat for kids. I found the gun wales, bow and stern shape, and keel determined the general shape of my canoe. For this canoe, I made most of the design decisions as I progressed.

These all steam bend fairly well but each have different advantages and disadvantages. I also experimented with some plywood; this does not steam-bend at all in my experience.\nRed Maple is a very lightweight wood and has natural properties which guard it against rotting easily. It does not bend well when it drys out, however. I found it took much longer for this wood in the steamer and it will not bend unless it is soaked through. It is easy to do a few test pieces then cut through the middle and check. The dry and wet sections will have a slightly different color. I would also recommend pre-soaking this wood for a few days before steaming. Obtaining red maple directly from a saw mill is ideal as it has not had as much time to dry out. Red maple also has a pleasant aroma to it and looks absolutely beautiful with linseed oil applied.\nOak is the strongest out of these three. It was also the easiest to steam bend out of my experiences. It holds in moisture which is why it bends easily, but this also causes it to have less of a tolerance for rotting over time.\nThe pine was also easy to work with but it tends to have more natural knots. When choosing pine, be careful to pick out a piece without knots or with very few and it should be okay.\nFor the lashing, I used an inexpensive waxed nylon string. This worked very well and it is still holding up.\nThe skin of the canoe and choosing a sealant were the most difficult parts of selecting materials. I would appreciate any offered tips for skin and sealant options. I used a 1050 outdoor ballistic nylon weave. It was already water proof and shrinks a little with heat.

To determine largest width rib, start in the middle of the canoe and it is simply the width of the middle of the boat. The narrowest rib in this design was about 12 inches from the bow.

Luckily, I found one of these someone was throwing away. I found the roaster, shown in the pictures, at a local thrift store for $5. The high capacity of the roaster allowed me to comfortably leave the steamer alone without worrying about refiling the water level. However, with the container you choose to use, make sure to watch it the first few times to get an idea of how long it takes for all the water to dissipate before leaving it alone. I then used a fuel grade hose to transfer the steam from the roster to the gutter (steam box). I got the hose used here from an auto-parts store for free. Just ask if there is any short sections or \"left overs.\" I have been able to get free tubing sections for many of my projects like this.\nTo seal off the gutter on the tube end, I used a wooden block with a hole in it. This preformed well because the block swelled up from the heat and steam therefore sealing the end. For the other end I simply used a rag. make sure to place something under the ends of the steam box to catch condensation.\nFor the steaming process, the 1\" by 2\" cross-section oak for the gun wales took about 4-6 hours to become workable. Thin pieces used for the ribs were workable in as little as 30 min as long as the steam was already running. Because the box was shorter than my long pieces of wood, I had to do them one end at a time. This did not cause me any issues. If you do decide to make a box long enough for the whole pieces to fit in, you may want to position more than one steam entrance hole as this with set-up most of the steam collected on one end causing nonuniform pliability when working with the wood.\nI will explain more of the bending techniques along with the specific pieces in later steps.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ9/H7CD/JIEU2ZMI/FZ9H7CDJIEU2ZMI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUE/9TP4/JIEU2ZMM/FUE9TP4JIEU2ZMM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F73/GKU9/JIEU2ZMK/F73GKU9JIEU2ZMK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Fast Forward!

This part \"cuts\" the water and takes the first impact of any collisions or running on shore. There was a lot of prep work involved with these pieces. First, I split the 2x4 into two sections with an ax. Splitting the wood with an ax rather simply cutting it with a table saw allowed the break in the wood to follow the grain. This keeps splinters from developing when bending. Next. I planed the pieces close to square. Again, using a plainer follows the natural grain of the wood better. Note, when choosing wood for the bow and stern, make sure the piece has no knots and the grain runs parallel to the grain with the board. Otherwise, the piece will break and/or splinter. Because the sections were thicker, I pre-soaked them before steam bending. This helps the wood be more workable after steaming. I modified the rib-jig for bending the bow and stern shape but I wound up not using it because I was not able to get the metal band, clamp, and wood around it.\nThe first attempt was a complete failure because the wood piece was mostly under tensile forces causing the grain to separate from itself. Because wood has much higher compressive strength than tensile, a method of bending where mostly compressive forces act on the wood is needed. An easy way to visualize these \"pulling\" and \"pushing\" like forces within a bent beam or member is to take a paperback book, hold it by the spine with one hand, and bend the book like an arch down its length. Notice the pages on the inside of the bend stick out further than those at the top? With a book the pages can move freely with each-other. Now imagine holding the edge of the book square while bending it. The pages near the top would most likely break under tensile \"pulling\" forces, and the pages on the bottom inside of the bend will wrinkle under compressive \"pushing\" forces. A metal band with stops on either side aided in solving this problem for the wood. It is .060\" aluminum sheeting with wood blocks attached to either end. Because the aluminum's tensile strength and modulus of elasticity is much much greater than that of the wood, it may be assumed to have almost no deformation in this case. Thus, if placed on the outside radius of the bend, as shown in the picture, it will retain almost all of the tensile forces and force the wood on the inside of the bend to be under mostly compression as long as the ends of the wood do not slip relative to the band.\nAfter completing a successful bend, I let the piece dry then cut it in half.

The rib jig shape and hole placement will determine their shape and curvature.\nI cut all of the rib pieces from 2x4's on a table saw. They are just over 1/4\" thick and an inch in width. Looking back I would have made these closer to 3/8\" thickness. The 1/4\" is too thin for an accidental step in the wrong spot. I would suggest, once you determine the rib spacing, take two blocks and set them this distance apart. then experiment with different rib thickness and width until you find one that can support your weight standing on it between the blocks. I preformed this test with mine after completing the project and found it took two of the pine ribs at 1/4\" thick and 1 in width to support my weight across a 4\" spacing.\nBefore steam bending the ribs, be sure to sand these very well. Any small splinters will split off into large sections when bending. These small pieces only took about 30 min in the steamer to become workable. Pull them out one at a time and bend them right away while they are still hot. I used a retaining block on the edge of my rib jig as a starting point then slowly bent the wood around the curvature of the jig. It is important to \"feel\" the wood during this process. It is hard to explain exactly what to watch for but if you start hearing any small cracking noises, it may not be steamed well enough or you are bending the wood too fast.

It seems to appeal especially to those who like to take a more simplistic and closer-to-the-essential nature approach to things. Most ski resorts do not allow these kind of boards, so it usually means hiking up a hill or into the backcountry mountains to ride, an experience that only brings oneself again closer to nature and the natural condition of things. And there is no specialized gear necessary to ride one of these boards \u2013 not even snowboard boots; simple snow boots will work just fine.\nIt\u2019s difficult, if not impossible to adequately describe the feeling that comes from simply standing freely on a plank of wood and allowing gravity to pull you down a hill covered with fresh powder snow. Throw in factors like momentum, inertia, hydrodynamics, g-force, weightlessness, and precision control, and it can become a mind blowing experience!\nAlthough there are high quality bindingless Snowsurf boards available commercially, some with highly sophisticated 3D designs, it is possible and not difficult to make your own board with basic materials from a hardware store for very little cost, using simple tools. And not only is it a fairly simple process to make a board, but the board can be highly functional, allowing for a high degree of control while riding, and a ton of fun!\nIt\u2019s the kind of back-to-basics fun that can remind oneself of the simple joys in life, like being a kid again and feeling the amazement of snowboarding or surfing for the first time.\nThis instructable will take you through the steps involved for making two different versions of a snowsurf board.

The board was affectionately known as \u2018Jugon\u2019 (Japanese for \u2018manatee\u2019) and provided a lot of laughs.. That project can be seen here and may provide additional information on methods and designs.\nhttps://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Your-Own-sNOw...\nSince then the crafting of the boards has been more focused on the functionality of design, with consideration given as well to aesthetics and appearance. The way a board will perform depends on a few elements of the design. Without getting too technical, it\u2019s the\n\u2022outline shape\n\u2022board profile (for example: the rise in the board\u2019s front end which allows it to plane over the snow)\n\u2022overall size\nwhich will primarily determine the riding characteristics of the board. These design inputs can be based on your own personal riding style, or could be the desired character you would like the board to have. (There are other design factors which also influence the way the board rides and these will be discussed later in the descriptions of shaping the boards for those interested in a more in-depth look at how board design influences the riding characteristics of a board.). The pictures illustrate some of the varieties of outline shapes and board profiles, which will influence how the board rides. For example:\nDo you want the board to be quick turning, slashy, and loose in the tail? Or would you rather the board is more of a cruiser, keeping a stable and steady feel at higher speeds? Or perhaps somewhere in between? These are some of the riding characteristics that can be designed into the board\u2019s shape. It can be a lot of fun to experiment and very satisfying to conceptualize a design, shape it into a tangible form, and then ride it down the mountain! -And all from a relatively simple piece of wood!\nThe two boards featured in this instructable each used different source materials and each has distinct riding characteristics, similar to the different styles described above.

This DIY Powder Surfer was crafted from a piece of construction grade plywood that I bought at the hardware store for about $16. The plywood comes from the factory with a durable enamel weatherproofing coating on one side, making it ideal for this project. But because the plywood is flat, this board needed to be given a profile to make it functional on snow.\nDrifty is a shape inspired by a snowboard I\u2019ve never ridden (the commercially produced board is too small for me) but have long admired the shape of.

But one thing that is generally held to be true that may be helpful here is that for boards like this, ridden in deep and powder snow with no bindings, much of the board\u2019s riding characteristics will come from the shape of the tail.\nWhile deciding on the outline shape was relatively easy, what was more difficult was deciding on the size. I struggled a bit, actually a lot, with the question: \u2018How big to make the board?\u2019 I knew snowsurf boards are typically smaller than their binding-clad counterparts, but how much smaller? What\u2019s an ideal length and width?\nBoard sizes, while often generalized in the factory-produced snowboarding world, don\u2019t necessarily match up with everyone\u2019s body size and proportions.\nFor example, it wasn\u2019t until I placed the prospective board sketches on the floor and actually stood on it, 193cm tall in size 12 snowboard boots positioned in my riding stance, that the proportions for a board became much more clear. Of course, it might seem obvious that a smaller board will be better for a smaller rider and the same holds true for a larger rider, but this is a great opportunity to make the board a customized fit to get the most out of the potential of the board and the riding experience.\nIn the end, Schwifty had an overall length of 158cm and Drifty came in at 150cm. The width of both boards was based upon my boot size.

Marking a center line on the blank can be very helpful in getting it right, by providing a reference for measuring distances from the boards center. Various methods can be used for tracing the desired outline shape onto the blank.\n\u2022For Schwifty I used all kinds of stuff to trace out a shape: From using other snowboards to mark the side-cut of the board (the hourglass shaped section between the nose and tail of the board) To using such things as kitchen serving bowls and other curvy shaped items to outline the various curves and transitions found on the nose and tail of the board. While the shape came from a quite freeform and creative place, still I measured carefully to be sure the board was centered and symmetrical. (If it\u2019s, in fact, a symmetrical shape you\u2019re after..)\n\u2022For Drifty I used templates provided by the workshop I attended for making the board. These templates made it much easier to get the desired shape right the first time, without a lot of erasing and re-tracing. Templates are relatively simple to make if you desire this approach. They can be made from cardboard, and have the advantage of providing a reliably symmetrical shape more easily: After tracing a line on one side of the board, simply flip the template over the center line to trace the mirror image on the other side of the board.

I recommend cutting just outside of the line, to allow space for the board to be shaped by hand, and to avoid accidentally cutting into the wrong side of the line, which can really make the heart sink and make for a lot more work to correct the overall shape of the board!\nTight curves, for example, if the board has a swallow-tail or fish-tail can be a little tricky, but a slow and steady saw will bring the best results.\nNow that the board is cut out, this is the fork in the road where Drifty and Schwifty take separate paths to meet up again later..\nWhile Drifty is ready for final shaping, Schwifty still needs an important element to make it an effective snow slider: It needs a rocker profile.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F13/O8AE/JIOU0QBC/F13O8AEJIOU0QBC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBJ/TS59/JIOU0QBF/FBJTS59JIOU0QBF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3M/CZ0J/JIOU0QBI/F3MCZ0JJIOU0QBI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJR/X7HG/JIOU0QCH/FJRX7HGJIOU0QCH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Bringing the Shape Out of the Blank"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Since the beginning of the invention of the ski, which far outdates the snowboard, at least by most historical accounts, the ski has had a design element giving it a distinct advantage over a flat plank when it comes to sliding over snow: a turned up nose, or rocker. And the same is true for snowboards. This is easy to take for granted in these modern times when examples of this innovation can be found on old skis piled up at thrift stores, but it becomes an important issue when making a homemade snow surfer.\nSo, how to give a sheet of plywood manufactured to be perfectly flat some permanent rocker? There\u2019s probably a number of ways to accomplish this, but what seemed most accessible and simple to me is to soak the wood in water and then lock it into a rockered shape, allowing the water to completely dry and hoping for the best. So after soaking overnight in the tub, locking it into shape, and letting the wood dry for seven days, much to my delight- and surprise- it worked!\nIn future projects using the same method, I may try putting the rocker into the board before cutting out the outline shape, to see if it gives me more control over the final outcome of the profile design.\nNow, with a board profile in place, it\u2019s time for the final shaping.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMP/MWYD/JIOU0N5A/FMPMWYDJIOU0N5A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4P/NUZ4/JIOU0N6A/F4PNUZ4JIOU0N6A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOC/LHH9/JIOU0N6C/FOCLHH9JIOU0N6C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F47/GRKS/JIOU0N6D/F47GRKSJIOU0N6D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXE/V9UJ/JIOU0N6G/FXEV9UJJIOU0N6G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH1/WGS5/JIOU0N6H/FH1WGS5JIOU0N6H.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Schwifty Gets Rockered"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "This part of the making process is perhaps my favorite..\nThere is something about shaping a board by hand that is indescribably satisfying. Watching as the board takes a more refined and beautiful shape right before one\u2019s eyes, with each passing stroke of the hands removing ever so finer layers and particles of dust to reveal elegant nature-inspired lines and sultry curves, and at last the appearance of the unimaginable shape of the board imagined by the mind\u2019s eye...\nBut before that can happen, still need to give it a rough shaping using rasps, files, and coarse grit sandpaper.. And for those with an interest, there is something to consider about some other more subtle aspects of the board\u2019s shape.\nAs mentioned before, there are other factors besides the board\u2019s outline shape, profile, and size that influence it\u2019s riding characteristics. In particular, these are the shape of the board\u2019s edges, and the shape or contours on the bottom of the board. Examples of these can be seen in the pictures.\nThe noses of both boards have been given special attention to shape, as the nose of the board determines how the board plows over and through the snow.\n\u2022Schwifty has been given a nose bottom shape similar to that of a boat hull, for the purpose of using a similar principle of hydrodynamics to create lift and a smooth flow of movement, while remaining playful and quick turning.\n\u2022Drifty, a shorter board, has a broader and more square shaped nose to give it more surface area for planing over the snow to provide lift. Also, the thickness of the nose section has been reduced considerably to make it lighter in the front both to counterbalance the board to keep the tail sunk with the nose above snow, and to reduce the board\u2019s swing weight to make it more nimble. The nose then transitions into the waist.\n\u2022The \u2018waist\u2019, of both boards has the edges kept squared off, sometimes to the point of near sharpness, to support responsiveness and crisp edge control on this part of the board. The waist transitions into the tail.\n\u2022 And the tail of each board has distinctly different shape characteristics giving each of the boards a more distinctive riding characteristic and feel. The tail of a snowsurf board has special significance in that much of the riding dynamic takes place on the tail, similar to the physics found in riding a surfboard in the water.\n\u2014Schwifty has a more tapered sort of modified diamond tail shape to give it a loose and playful yet still precise feel and the edges have been rounded up considerably to make it even looser and more slashy.\n\u2014Drifty, on the other hand, has a less tapered crescent moon shape tail to give it a longer effective edge and more stability, since it has a shorter overall length. The crescent moon shape also allows the tail to sink more easily in the snow, keeping the nose of the board up and planing over the snow. The tail edges have been left fairly squared off to lend further to its stability, and additionally, channels have been carved into the bottom along the edges to greatly increase its tail stability and ability to track in a straight line. These two boards ride very differently!\nThe shaping process can be simple or extensive, depending on your interest. As the shaping progresses from rough to more and more refined, the board in it\u2019s finished form begins to emerge, smoother and with more nuanced subtlety! A thing of true beauty revealed from a chunk of wood!\nAs the final outline shape approaches, I like to do more and more of the sanding by hand, especially the shape of the edges. While a power sander such as an orbital sander can be very useful for sanding out the rough shape, removing larger amounts of wood and doing the finish sanding on the large surface areas, I still prefer doing the edge finish sanding by hand. A power sander is a highly efficient tool, but can also lead to time consuming mistakes by taking off too much material in delicately refined places\u2014 removing excess wood is not difficult, but putting wood back on is not so easy!\nNow that the board is in its finished shape, there\u2019s one more important thing to consider: How do you keep your feet from slipping off the board while flying through the snow?", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FR5/J23Z/JIOU9XCV/FR5J23ZJIOU9XCV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1L/Z9CL/JIOU9XD9/F1LZ9CLJIOU9XD9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQK/8K3Z/JIOU9XDA/FQK8K3ZJIOU9XDA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUJ/ZIBF/JIOU9XFX/FUJZIBFJIOU9XFX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F45/2P8K/JIOU9XGB/F452P8KJIOU9XGB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCD/XRU7/JIOU9XGP/FCDXRU7JIOU9XGP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNS/GG3L/JIOU9XH3/FNSGG3LJIOU9XH3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO6/J3WB/JIOU9XHU/FO6J3WBJIOU9XHU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUU/LNDL/JIOU9XI8/FUULNDLJIOU9XI8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7M/ZXCU/JIOU9XIN/F7MZXCUJIOU9XIN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGZ/TWZI/JIOU9YPK/FGZTWZIJIOU9YPK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM9/1WEY/JIOU9YU5/FM91WEYJIOU9YU5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F26/Q73M/JIOU9YZ3/F26Q73MJIOU9YZ3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLY/TM6X/JIOU9YZS/FLYTM6XJIOU9YZS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8O/3789/JIOU9Z08/F8O3789JIOU9Z08.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F99/KVFB/JIOU9Z0K/F99KVFBJIOU9Z0K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP0/HMM3/JIOU9Z5D/FP0HMM3JIOU9Z5D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F33/3373/JIOU9Z62/F333373JIOU9Z62.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD3/Z4YC/JIOUA4O5/FD3Z4YCJIOUA4O5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCK/H8WN/JIOUL1XZ/FCKH8WNJIOUL1XZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Shaping: Revealing the Diamond in the Rough"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "So now that the board has emerged in its desired shape, the topsheet will need something to assist with traction to keep the board from slipping out from beneath your feet while riding.\nThere are several different ways this can be done, such as mixing coarse sand with paint and applying it to the top sheet, or using adhesive foam or stomp pads made for surfboards. The way it has been done here is to fix wooden pegs into the board to create a grippy surface that is effective even if the board becomes covered with snow.\nThis was done by first using graph paper to lay out the pattern, then using a sharp piercing tool to mark the locations on the board, keeping in mind that there will be two additional holes drilled through the board to secure a leash anchor and allowing for this location (Shown in the next step).\nThe drill bit is marked with tape so as to get the correct depth of the holes. These boards are about 15mm thick, so I drilled to a depth of about 6-7mm to get a secure footing.\nI made a simple cutting guide to easily cut the dowel off at a uniform height to create an even textured pattern. This was a small piece of plywood with a hole drilled through it and the same thickness as the desired length of the peg to be left sticking out of the board (as shown in the pictures). Generally I left 5mm of the dowel sticking out to form the traction pad.\nThen, using a little glue to make a more permanent bond , I tapped the dowel in using a small mallet, then used the cutting guide and a fine-tooth saw to cut it off at the proper height.\nFor Schwifty, I took a very straightforward approach, using a simple grid pattern made with 6mm diameter dowel, left sticking out 5mm .\nFor Drifty, I wanted to make it more elaborate and decorative, so I did more complex geometric patterns using several different diameters of dowel, such as 6, 8, and 10 mm. Additionally, I wanted to build in some canting (areas of greater thickness to change the contact angle of the foot to the board) so the amount of dowel left sticking out ranged from 5 mm to 8mm, as shown in the pictures.\nThis style of traction pads worked very well, keeping the board feeling a very solid and dependable connection underfoot. Only very occasionally did I need to replace a peg that got knocked out on Schwifty, and because I got a bit carried away with the elaborate design patterns on Drifty, it did not shed snow as well due to placing the pegs a little too close together.\nAll in all, I liked the results, and will be using this method again for it it\u2019s effectiveness, simplicity, and appearance.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWN/C7XA/JIOU0OI8/FWNC7XAJIOU0OI8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7W/HG6T/JIOU0OJ1/F7WHG6TJIOU0OJ1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKK/F44M/JIOU0OJV/FKKF44MJIOU0OJV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F83/KUTX/JIOU0OJY/F83KUTXJIOU0OJY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0I/1D1I/JIOU0OKS/F0I1D1IJIOU0OKS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNR/UA7L/JIOU0OKV/FNRUA7LJIOU0OKV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9C/U0TV/JIOU0OMV/F9CU0TVJIOU0OMV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQQ/V87J/JIOU0OMW/FQQV87JJIOU0OMW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI7/WDAS/JIOU0OMX/FI7WDASJIOU0OMX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNS/MSGM/JIOU0OMY/FNSMSGMJIOU0OMY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMN/VCVN/JIOU0ONX/FMNVCVNJIOU0ONX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSC/08JH/JIOU0OO0/FSC08JHJIOU0OO0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFO/GFHQ/JIOU0OOZ/FFOGFHQJIOU0OOZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG2/4QLK/JIOU0OPZ/FG24QLKJIOU0OPZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR4/755K/JIOU0OR0/FR4755KJIOU0OR0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSM/T6BG/JIOUA7XK/FSMT6BGJIOUA7XK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: Footloose and Fancy Free"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "There is nothing keeping you physically or mechanically stuck to the board- but only the dynamics of nature. This allows for a tremendous sense of freedom. But as someone wiser than myself once said \u201cwith great freedom comes great responsibility.\u201c or something like that.\nSo using a leash is not a bad idea. It\u2019s not difficult, even for an experienced rider, for the board to get away from you. A leash prevents the board from getting too far, like all the way down the mountain, or into a tree, or even worse, into another person. In order to make it easy to connect a leash to the board, there is a leash anchor built into the board.\nAs shown in the pictures, this is accomplished simply by drilling two small holes completely through the board (6mm) then on the bottom side of the board, drilling the same holes to a larger diameter (10mm) and limited depth. A piece of strong cord (5-6mm thick) can then be fed through the holes, leaving a loop on the top side of the board. The ends of the cord on the bottom side of the board are then tied into knots, and securely pulled in, countersunk or flush with the bottom of the board (Diagram shown in the photos).\n**It\u2019s recommended to paint the board or apply weatherseal & you may want to wait until after you do so to fasten the leash anchor cord to the board.\nThere\u2019s no rules as to where to put the leash anchor. Most people put it on the tail of the board, or sometimes between the feet in the middle of the board if they like to do tricks. Anywhere it is going to allow you the most freedom of movement, and get in the way the least is a suitable placement.\nThe leash itself can be made from a strong nylon cord or nylon webbing, with strong carabiners on the ends for convenience. The length of the leash should be neither too short north too long, Roughly the same length as your own height will probably be adequate for most people. Most of the time the leash is attached to a secure spot near the hip of their back leg, such as to a belt or backpack or a very strong belt loop that will not pull out, but again this is open to interpretation.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHA/8ABP/JIOU7S9L/FHA8ABPJIOU7S9L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8N/ONTJ/JIOU7SAK/F8NONTJJIOU7SAK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKR/Z86K/JIOU7SCG/FKRZ86KJIOU7SCG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMA/O750/JIOU7SCH/FMAO750JIOU7SCH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDX/CBYH/JIOU7SDF/FDXCBYHJIOU7SDF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJL/SX9A/JIOU7SH4/FJLSX9AJIOU7SH4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMJ/2J2I/JIOU7SH8/FMJ2J2IJIOU7SH8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F20/1SGD/JIOU7SI6/F201SGDJIOU7SI6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0G/J3QC/JIOU7SMX/F0GJ3QCJIOU7SMX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR3/MUZ4/JIOU7SOX/FR3MUZ4JIOU7SOX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBT/KHY1/JIOUA891/FBTKHY1JIOUA891.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIH/8M5T/JIOUL02O/FIH8M5TJIOUL02O.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 11: Free to Fly..

There are many beautiful examples of boards with graphic art designs out there; from painting to silkscreen to relief woodcarved designs, which can add another whole dimension of beauty to the boards.\nThe last thing left to do to finish the board is to give it a weatherseal to keep the wood from being exposed to too much water. I used a water-based urethane stain in about four or five coats and that seemed to do the trick. The base of Schwifty already had a durable factory enamel coating so it didn\u2019t need any additional painting or sanding in that area. For Drifty\u2019s base, a light finish sanding with very fine sandpaper, such as 1000 grit, after painting made it super smooth and slide more easily over the snow.

For first time riders it can go a long way to simply stay relaxed and try to keep a lower center of gravity by bending the knees- and have fun! There are many tips and pointers available online for surfing and snowboarding, many of which will also apply to this activity. Like surfing or other similar sports, ones ability increases with frequency, that is, the more often you do it, the more quickly your abilities improve.\nBoards such as these will perform best in deeper amounts of light powder snow. However, depending on conditions, 10 cm of snow may be enough, and heavier snow can still be workable. What they don\u2019t work well for is hard pack or crusty or icy conditions.\nThere is a lot of simple pleasure to be found with boards like this \u2013 no need to buy lift tickets at a ski resort, or any specialized gear; a regular pair of snow boots will work just fine. It\u2019s great exercise and a wonderful way to spend time in nature and with friends.\nAnd if by chance you don\u2019t really like the way the board rides and want to modify the shape by removing material, that can be done too.

Next, place the jack under the frame of the vehicle close to a corner or as close to the tire needing changed as possible. After that start raising the jack. Tip: Jacks can be difficult to handle when on the ground, extend the jack as much as possible to allow it to fit under the vehicle, before placing it under the vehicle. Scissor jacks will require the tool with the hook end and the breaker bar. Insert the hook into the loop on the outside loop in the middle of the jack. Take the other end of the hook tool, the square end, and insert it into the middle of the breaker bar. (Tools may vary depending on vehicle make.) To raise the jack, use the breaker bar and spin it clockwise and the vehicle will begin to rise. If a bottle Jack is required stick the square end of one of the tools into the hole on the jack knob and twist clockwise to raise.

Generaly I like to have my multi tool and a flashlight with me at all times, and when I go in the field I carry several more things, such as survival gear and first aid items that may be needed in a hurry like field dressings, tourniquet etc. So today I am going to show you how I make my own pouches to carry things in.\nThey are extremely easy to make, and a lot cheaper than buying more carrying pouches.", "title": "Diy Tactical Belt Pouches", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Diy-Tactical-Belt-Pouches/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The first thing you will need is some good sturdy material to make the pouches out of. I prefer something that is either vinyl, nylon or polyester, they seem to last longer. The material I am using here is part of the leg from a pair of tactical pants that the right knee wore out of. Tactical pants are generally made with a type of weave that will stop the fabric from ripping if it gets cut. As with any fabric it will eventually get weak from use or from rubbing against something, but the good thing about these pouches are they are easy and quick to make, and cheap.\nA few other ideas for material would be old backpacks or duffle bags, and most types of luggage are made from fairly strong material. For this project though, the fabric can not be to thick or stiff. If it is, it may not be flexible enough.\nFirst off, let me say I can not stitch anything. So for this project the only thing needed to bond the material together is a good quality super glue. I like all types of Loctite Superglue. The gel type bonds faster than liquid superglue, and it resists water and will function fine in temperatures below freezing. This will be good for the main adhesive used in this project. Liquid super glue is also useful, especially for gluing the edges of the nylon straps, and the pouch seams.\nThis address will take you to the Loctite website, where you can get more information, including the material safety data sheets.\nhttp://www.loctiteproducts.com/super-glue.shtml\nSuper glue will bond skin together in seconds, so knowing what to do if that should happen before hand will be easier than trying to look it up with fingers all glued together, or if you find yourself glued to your project.\nFor closures I use velcro, which can also be glued in place, provided the velcro is not the industrial strength kind. This kind of velcro is meant to hold heavy objects and is not suited to this kind of job. I bought a pack of Velcro tape from Dollar General for 90 cents that is perfectly strong enough for this.\nTo add strength, and your own style, you will need a nylon strap. If you are making this from a backpack or duffle bag there should be some on it. Nylon dog leashes and tie down straps are also potential sources. I am sure there are more sources for these materials, but these are the ones I have around my house, and in my workshop / junk pile storage area. The straps I am using are shoulder straps from duffle bags that I do not use.\nOnce a nylon strap has been cut, it will immediately begin to fray. The easiest way to remedy this, and the way that looks the best is to simply coat the end with the liquid super glue.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBV/WS6E/JIEU26W3/FBVWS6EJIEU26W3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJJ/CYIK/JIEU26WO/FJJCYIKJIEU26WO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F71/FV72/JIEU2B0S/F71FV72JIEU2B0S.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Materials and Their Uses"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Now, as far as tools needed for this project, the list is pretty short;\n1; Scissors\n2; Ruler or tape measure\n3; Corrugated cardboard box\nThat is it!\nTo start things off I will begin with my multi tool. So far it has outlived two store bought belt pouches, and since then I have been carrying it in my cargo pocket, much to my knee's disapproval.\nUsing my pair of tactical pants, I cut off the leg just below the knee.\nI then split the leg lengthwise as close to the seam as possible. Scissors work best for this, a box cutter could be used but it will sometimes bunch the fabric up and give you jagged edges. Remove all the rest of the seams, so you have a nice flat piece of material.\nNext, measure the object you intend to use this pouch for. My multitool is 4 1/2\" long, 1 1/2\" wide, and 3/4\" deep. Take one section of your cardboard box and cut some pieces to the length and width of your object, and stack them until they reach the right depth. you can then tape or glue them together. For the rest of the project you will use this in place of the actual object to prevent getting glue all over it.\nThe size your piece of material will need to be is 3x the length, and 2 1/2x the width. When the material is folded over the object to make the pouch, the width of the material covers both the width and the depth, which is why it has to be 2 1/2x the width of the object, in this case the multitool.\nTake the rest of your box to lay down for your work surface, as it is likely to get glue all over it.\nLay the material out flat, with the side that you want as the outside of the finished pouch facing up. Once we get some of the edges glued we will turn it inside out, so for right now what looks like it will be the inside is actually the outside.\nLay your fake cardboard object on the material and pull the it up so that it covers the entire object, then fold the material back at the top like bed covers. Glue this down with generous amounts of the gel super glue. You will have to hold some pressure on this until it dries, but the glue will penetrate the material so you will have to press it down for a few seconds, then move your fingers before you become a bigger part of your project than you would like to be. Let it dry about 5 minutes. Next glue the sides down, again with generous amounts of the gel glue. Repeat your press and move process as you do this. I found it easier to make the sides come out even if I did both sides at the same time. Let it dry about 5 minutes.\nAgain, the glue will seep through, and it may also glue your pouch down to your work surface, so be careful.\nNext, using the long \"tail\" at the top of the pouch, carefully turn it inside out. Check to make sure the object slides in easily. If so, cut the \"tail\" off leaving about 1/2 inch. Apply glue to this and fold it inside the pouch. This will help create a stiff and durable top. Apply liquid glue to each side seam, to increase the strength of each side.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5D/WRYL/JIEU26YJ/F5DWRYLJIEU26YJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD8/1YA3/JIEU270E/FD81YA3JIEU270E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLY/AFR3/JIEU277I/FLYAFR3JIEU277I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHO/YRYC/JIEU27EW/FHOYRYCJIEU27EW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM5/V6ZL/JIEU287P/FM5V6ZLJIEU287P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLS/1I6U/JIEU27LE/FLS1I6UJIEU27LE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFE/7MUW/JIEU28BE/FFE7MUWJIEU28BE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEF/HU9G/JIEU28F0/FEFHU9GJIEU28F0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOL/9OPH/JIEU28GK/FOL9OPHJIEU28GK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGA/UUWG/JIEU2AB0/FGAUUWGJIEU2AB0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZV/BJPB/JIEU2AE2/FZVBJPBJIEU2AE2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHM/MFCN/JIEU2AXE/FHMMFCNJIEU2AXE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGO/X9QD/JIEU2AZT/FGOX9QDJIEU2AZT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Carrying Pouches for Common Items"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Next you need to put your real object inside the pouch. Using a nylon strap, which will be used to add support and serve as the closure for the pouch, measure off enough length so that it is long enough to go around the pouch and the object lengthwise, and overlap enough to cover the width of the Velcro used to hold it closed.\nNow put your cardboard fake back in for the rest of the gluing. Starting at the front, apply the gel glue to the pouch and press the nylon strap to it. Continue around the bottom and back. Trim the overlap until it is just long enough to cover the width of the Velcro, and seal the end with glue. You can now cut a length of Velcro to the appropriate size, determined by the width of the pouch. The Velcro I bought was a Velcro tape, but the adhesive tape on the back is not strong enough by its self to hold when applied to fabric.\nThere will be a lot of pull on this part of the pouch when opening, so apply plenty of the gel glue under the Velcro. Super glue will seem to be dry within a few minutes, but to reach full cure it should set for 24 hours. This step should not be cut short for the glue holding the Velcro in place. Wait at least 24 hours before using the Velcro once it has been applied.\nAll that is left to do now is to add the belt loop. Cut another nylon strap, usually about 4 inches will allow most tactical or nylon belts through. Glue heavily on each end to ensure the weight of the tool does not pull it off. Finish by gluing all seams and edges one more time with the liquid glue and you are done. This same technique can be used for any kind of object you want to carry. Measurements for your pouches are tailored to the size of whatever you want to use it for.\nFor most things, 3x the length, and 2 1/2x the width is a good size. If you do end up with extra material, trim it away after gluing. As with anything you will be using in the field, test it out first to make sure your seams are firmly set. Besides carrying on a belt, these are great for duct taping to the shoulder straps of a backpack for quick access to your gear.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRK/GWUY/JIEU2B0J/FRKGWUYJIEU2B0J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7M/JKI9/JIEU2B0L/F7MJKI9JIEU2B0L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCR/6CVD/JIEU2B0P/FCR6CVDJIEU2B0P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9Z/6LQ2/JIEU2B0O/F9Z6LQ2JIEU2B0O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEJ/XVGT/JIEU2B0U/FEJXVGTJIEU2B0U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPY/FQ59/JIEU2B0V/FPYFQ59JIEU2B0V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F60/O8AC/JIEU2B3B/F60O8ACJIEU2B3B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN4/TSI0/JIEU2B3C/FN4TSI0JIEU2B3C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD8/LQ9B/JIEU2B3D/FD8LQ9BJIEU2B3D.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Adding Support and Velcro Closure"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Making a holster for a flashlight is incredibly simple, and quick. For this you will need two nylon straps. One around 10 inches long for a belt loop, and the other long enough to go around your flashlight 2 1/4 times. You will also need something just slightly bigger around than your flashlight handle. For mine, an old deep well socket is perfect.\nWith your 10 inch long strap, fold it over to make a loop that is about 3 1/2 inches, and glue the remaining 1 1/2 inches together.\nNext, wrap the other nylon strap around your \"fake\" object until it reaches the point of overlapping, and apply a strip of gel glue to hold it. This will be your holster. Keep applying glue and rolling for another quarter turn. Let this set about 5 minutes to dry before continuing. Apply a wide section of gel glue to each side of the glued together end of the belt loop, and the inside edges of the holster. Lay the belt loop on the holster and roll it up inside. Continue rolling and gluing until you reach the end. If the end of your holster strap is going to end up on the front of the holster, it is fine to trim it so that it ends near the back, out of sight.\nWhile it is drying, it may be necessary to clamp or tape it around the \"fake\" flashlight to preserve its round shape.\nAgain, glue all seams and edges again with liquid glue to strengthen the holster. The same technique used for the other pouches will work fine for a flashlight too, but I like this design better, because it is lighter, allows easier access to the flashlight, and it will not hold water around the flashlight if it gets wet. This part is especially useful if temperatures will be below freezing.\nLet it dry for 24 hours before use.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FML/75K9/JIEU4DP0/FML75K9JIEU4DP0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRI/87DI/JIEU4DQJ/FRI87DIJIEU4DQJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAC/27J7/JIEU4DQQ/FAC27J7JIEU4DQQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEM/QM39/JIEU4DPE/FEMQM39JIEU4DPE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FET/PC3I/JIEU4DPS/FETPC3IJIEU4DPS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDW/ZIH3/JIEU4DQ9/FDWZIH3JIEU4DQ9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJF/CY8C/JIEU4DQX/FJFCY8CJIEU4DQX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F24/KD0K/JIEU4DRA/F24KD0KJIEU4DRA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F04/F4SF/JIEU4DRF/F04F4SFJIEU4DRF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4I/7KL5/JIEU4DRO/F4I7KL5JIEU4DRO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Flashlight Holster"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "That is it!
