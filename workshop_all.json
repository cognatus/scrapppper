[{"category": "Workshop", "description": "We'll be making a planter with a funny twist, because houseplants don't have to be boring. This Instructable is an entry to the Remix Contest, because I got inspired by the shampoo bottle monster pencil holder from Bianca Barreto:\nMine is made from wood instead of a shampoo bottle. It's made mostly with hand tools, with the exception of an electrical jigsaw (see further). I'd like to point out that although the body of the monster is round, there is no lathe required. The process for making it is somewhat similar to coopering, the long lost art of making wooden barrels for wine, beer and other spirits. For the main body of our planter, I chose oak. Mainly because I had it at hand but also because it's quite durable, which means it doesn't rot easily. Of course, any other durable hardwood would do fine too. You could even get away with softwood if you meticulously coat the inside with a waterproof finish.\nIf you're new to hand tool woodworking, I suggest you take a peek at the YouTube channel of Paul Sellers. There you will find everything there is to learn: planing, sawing, chiseling etc. For this Instructable, I'll assume you already have some basic knowledge. Feel free to ask me anything in the comments. About this project, of course :-)\nWithout further ado, let's get building!", "title": "Friendly Monster Planter", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Friendly-Monster-Planter/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "As I mentioned earlier, I had some oak strips available (pic 1). These will become the so-called staves of the barrel. They are 2.5 cm (1 inch) thick and a little over 5 cm (2 inch) wide. This thickness might seem a bit excessive, but later on we'll shape the body and we need to remove a lot of wood without the body getting too thin and fragile. Using a crosscut saw (pic 2), all pieces are cut to 30 cm (almost 12 inch). This resulted in the stack you see in pic 3. After taking a good look at it, I decided to cut them all in half using a rip saw (pic 4). This will make it a lot easier to approximate a cylinder, since the facets will be narrower and will require less shaping to get a round object.\nNext, plane all the inside and outside faces of the staves (pic 5) and choose how they will go together (pic 6). Mark them with a triangle to establish their order. Try to pay attention to grain direction. Now we're ready to join them into a barrel shape.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQQ/VLZB/JJEK2345/FQQVLZBJJEK2345.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYF/QMI9/JJEK234J/FYFQMI9JJEK234J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLJ/OKBB/JJEK236Q/FLJOKBBJJEK236Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW7/ITXL/JJEK237D/FW7ITXLJJEK237D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FII/0IVO/JJEK238X/FII0IVOJJEK238X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUF/FUII/JJEK239R/FUFFUIIJJEK239R.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Dimensioning Your Lumber"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "This step is where the magic happens. If you were to make a panel, you would plane all the edges square before gluing up. But here we will plane the edges at an angle on purpose (pic 1 and 2). At what angle you say? It depends on the radius you want. In my case the angle is about 5\u00b0 off from 90\u00b0, so 85\u00b0. Regardless of the angle you choose, it's a good idea to set your bevel gauge to that angle (pic 2), so that you get a consistent angle on every stave. Of course you need to plane both edges of each stave at that angle. The outside part of the stave should be wider than the inside part. Picture 3 shows that with just 3 staves, you already see the beginning of a curved surface.\nContinue planing all staves at an angle on both sides. Test each stave against the previous one to test the fit. I find it best to create two halves first, and then later glue those halves together. Before the glue up, you can wrap rubber bands around the staves to test the fit and get an idea of the diameter (pic 4). To glue up one half, use painter's tape to connect the staves on the outside (pic 5). Then apply glue (pic 6) and add more tape and rubber bands to hold everything together until the glue is dry (pic 7). Repeat to make the other half and leave both halves to dry for about half a day.\nYou'll notice the two halves won't exactly fit together. You can make corrections by planing the edges at the correct angle (pic 8). Test the fit regularly while doing this. Once you're happy that both halves fit together nicely, apply glue to the edges and clamp everything up (pic 9). And tadaaa, you made yourself a barrel.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F25/TYM7/JJEK49EW/F25TYM7JJEK49EW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTJ/ALQ0/JJEK49F5/FTJALQ0JJEK49F5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWL/I6EZ/JJEK49FE/FWLI6EZJJEK49FE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJX/WP9T/JJEK49G2/FJXWP9TJJEK49G2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTF/F53K/JJEK49GH/FTFF53KJJEK49GH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC4/E5F7/JJEK49H4/FC4E5F7JJEK49H4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCM/9RK6/JJEK49HJ/FCM9RK6JJEK49HJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAV/JQNN/JJEK49HK/FAVJQNNJJEK49HK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS6/KG8R/JJEK49I7/FS6KG8RJJEK49I7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Making the Barrel Shape"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "While the glue dries, we can start making a face and arms for our monster.

Take extra care when cutting out pupils and teeth. I would not recommend sawing out small pieces like this with a jigsaw if you're not experienced.

Keep planing down bottom and top, until you have a barrel-shaped object like in picture 3. Refine this shape further with a smoothing plane (pic 4), until you get rid off the roughness.

So let's add one. I found a scrap piece of oak that would do. Choose which side you want to be the bottom, and trace it with a pencil (pic 1). Cut it out with a jigsaw, and make sure to keep away from your line. It's a good idea to mark how the bottom corresponds to the body (pic 2), because chances are your planter won't be exactly round. Apply wood glue to the edge (pic 3), let it soak in a bit, apply some more and then clamp everything up (pic 4). We are gluing end grain to face grain here, so that's why the glue needs to soak into the end grain a bit.\nOnce the glue is dry, remove the hard edge with a sharp chisel (pic 5). This bevel will prevent the fibers from tearing out when you plane the end grain flush with the body (pic 6). Refine the bevel with your smoothing plane (pic 7).

The bottom edge is a bit sloppy, but that's fine because it won't be seen.\nChisel away the eye cavities as well (pic 4). Glue on teeth and pupils first, leave to dry, then glue everything to the body with clamps (pic 5).

Alternatively, you could either drill holes and put a scale under it, or you could fit a plastic pot on the inside. Next, fill the planter with regular potting soil (pic 2).\nAs for the plant, I chose a very easy to keep house plant called spider plant (Chlorophytum sp.) It grows in a wide variety of conditions. It spontaneously forms new shoots that easily take root, so it's very easy to propagate. Fun fact: this plant made NASA's list of air-purifying house plants. All plants produce oxygen, but the plants on this list also remove pollutants like formaldehyde from the air. Formaldehyde is a common pollutant in houses, originating from foam insulation, particleboard, fabrics and various other synthetic materials.\nAnyway, select a couple of shoots, cut them off (pic 3), plant them in potting soil (pic 4) and water them.

In fact, our fridge is exposed along its right side, since it is located at the crossroads of our house.

Instead of going through the work of making two complete doors, I opted for a simpler approach.

However at one point I realized that the drill press would make this way faster and since I'm usually making 20 pens at a time this is a great way to cut time down. However, using the drill press requires a little bit of finesse as it's powerful enough to chew right through the brass tubes.

I like the Easy Wood Tools square and circle cutters to do my pens and they're just amazing.\nNo matter how you do it, use your roughing gouge to start and get the blank to round. And then use the chisel of your choice to trim it down.\nYour goal with the carving is to get the ends flush with the bushings so that the hardware will fit. One other tip I have is that if you get a knot or a chip in the wood (as seen above), put a dab of CA thin glue in the hole and fill it with shavings. Don't worry, you'll sand it down later.\nYou can carve whatever shape you want, just make it pen-like. For a true slimline, make the blanks uniform from end to end. Or you can go fancy and make the bottom half a little fatter around the middle and tapered down. You'll just want to make sure that on the top half you make it mostly the slimline shape as the pen clip will ultimately go there and it needs to be uniform for that.\nOne other tip is to leave yourself a little extra wood on the bushing ends for sanding.

Probably around 800 rpm's. You can go faster, but you run the risk of burning your fingers. If your lathe has a reverse mode, use that for sanding as all your dust will fly backward.\nStarting at 150 grit, sand your pen blank down to get your final shape. You'll probably go through more 150 grit than any other grit in the pack. But it's important to make sure your ends are flush to the bushings and that you like your final shape.Once you're good with that, turn off the lathe and you'll be able to see the grit markings on the wood. To fix this you should now take that same grit and rub it cross-wise on the blank, slowly turning it until you get all the way around. This should get rid of the rest of your tool marks and your sandpaper scratches.\nRepeat for each grit up through 600.\nClean with denatured alcohol after 600 grit. I use a paper towel and wet it with the alcohol, then turning the lathe back on wipe it down. I usually do this 2 or 3 times. You'll be able to tell when you're done as you'll stop getting dirt and blackness on your paper towel.\nNext we'll wet sand with the micromesh. Get a cup of water and dip each pad in the water as you go. Keeping the lathe on, wet sand from the 1500 grit all the way up to the 12000, drying with a paper towel between each grit. No need to do the horizontal sanding with these.\nWhat we're doing here is that the water will raise the grain of the wood and then the sanding pad will sand it back down. This ensures a super smooth piece of wood.\nThe BLO and CA finish is a little hard to explain. We're doing one half at a time.\nWith the lathe on, put some BLO on a piece of paper towel and run it over the piece of blank. Run it back and forth, until the BLO is completely dried.\nThen place 3 drops of the thin CA on the paper towel over the spot where the BLO was. Run it back and forth over the same piece of wood, quickly, until it dries out as well.\nYou'll want to keep the paper towel moving the whole time or it might stick to the wood.\nRepeat for 3 -12 coats per piece. I usually stop at 4 but I've seen people who go up to a dozen. Completely depends on what kind of finish you want.\nIf you mess up the CA at any stage you can fix it by just starting over with the sanding at 150.

By using a relatively small value for the infill (around 20% for me) you can make surprisingly light yet strong pieces. This hollow infill will also make for a crushable area that can further protect the equipment inside from extreme shocks.\nI started this design when I still had a small 3D printer with around 4\" x 4\" x 4\" print area. All the pieces can be printed on a printer of this size except for some longer rail pieces. I've included shorter versions of those rails as well.\nIn this version the panels are 4 x 4 inches, the rails are generally 1 1/2 inches (finished dimension). By varying the number of panels you can get case sizes in factors of 4 inches. The panels come in 2 styles, \"male\" and \"female\", with the inner flat area either protruding slightly (approx. 1/16\") or recessed the same amount. By using these in opposition you can make the case more stackable, the panels on separate cases can register to each other like Tupperware.\nI will be updating and improving the pieces for this case over time, with the project posted here and on Thingiverse. However, with multiple copies of only 7 different pieces you can make the exact case you need.", "title": "Modular 3D Printed Hardbox", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Modular-3D-Printed-Hardbox/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "This version of the hardbox files are 4\" x 4\" panels, and 1 1/2\" corners and edges. This will allow for boxes in increments of 7\", 11\", 15\", 19\", etc. in each dimension. The box in these photos is 11\" x 15\" x 5 1/2\" deep. The box lid can be thin, as in the instructable, or built as the base with panels on the edges.\nThe panels are available in \"female\" and \"male\" variations, where the inset area in recessed (female) or extends (male). If the boxes built are meant to be stacked, alternating the female and male pieces will let them stack easily. Otherwise either panel type may be used. The male panels will be slightly stronger/thicker than than the female ones.\nTo make the box in this guide requires 34 pieces. Broken down that's 16 female 4x4 panels, 6 male 4x4 panels, 4 bottom corners, 4 opening corners and 4 shallow lid corners. In addition to box pieces you'll need hinges, handle, handle mounts and latches.\nImport the enclosed files to your favorite slicer program (i.e. Cura) and print as needed for the application. A \"light\" box can use settings of 20% infill, .175mm extrusion and 2 shell layers. Test higher (or lower) numbers to get the right amount of \"sturdy\". Even though those settings may seem very light, remember that the final case will be glued together with splice pieces in the slots. This construction will make the final case much more sturdy than any single piece right off the printer.\nThe exception to these settings however is for printing hinges, latches and the handle and its mounts. Print these pieces as strong as possible (100% infill) and positioned so the filament is extruded along the longest length runs, rather than the shortest as the perpendicular angle (to the filament extrusion direction) is weakest. Splice pieces will also benefit from being printed at 100% infill.\nThis box with the settings described require approximately 1.5 kilos of filament. I printed in PLA, but ABS would work fine and allow for acetone smoothing of the final assembled box. Don't acetone smooth before assembly as acetone vapor treatment shrinks the pieces and could wreck the dimensionality. Once an ABS box is fully assembled a very light touch acetone treatment would help the finish as well as sealing seams and improving the strength of the joints.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFK/PT6K/JTON1659/FFKPT6KJTON1659.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUG/2T2J/JTON168B/FUG2T2JJTON168B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCM/1KVV/JTON165Y/FCM1KVVJTON165Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F47/Y78F/JTON1607/F47Y78FJTON1607.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVR/KGMD/JTON17VI/FVRKGMDJTON17VI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT2/9D84/JTON17SJ/FT29D84JTON17SJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1H/U0LI/JTON162Q/F1HU0LIJTON162Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMU/AIZ9/JTON15XS/FMUAIZ9JTON15XS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3F/TSMB/JTON15W1/F3FTSMBJTON15W1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTC/XTZV/JTON15UB/FTCXTZVJTON15UB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE3/4U4F/JTON15SM/FE34U4FJTON15SM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8R/LDUE/JTON15R7/F8RLDUEJTON15R7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBT/T655/JTON15K3/FBTT655JTON15K3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIT/EAST/JTON15IP/FITEASTJTON15IP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5T/88QN/JTON15O5/F5T88QNJTON15O5.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Determine Required Box Size and Pieces to Print"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "It's important to test fit all pieces before gluing.

Dad and I went through a few ideas on how to construct them. However, before he had a chance to build them he passed away. My family said it was now up to me to carry on the woodworking tradition of the family. So with this I decided to take the ideas we had started with to make these advent calendars. The first couple I made I had some serious issues with the doors. How to hinge them... After trying to make custom ones with thin metal, using \u00bd\u201d steel dowels and modifying regular hinges, I finally came up with an idea that would work. I use long pieces of 1/8\u201d steel rod that run through the full height of the calendar going through holes in the doors. This may sound tricky, but it is actually quite simple.\nThe calendars are highlighted with a Christmas tree in the top gable area with a battery-operated tea light in behind to give a nice glow. My preference for wood is maple for the main case and Padauk for the doors and accent pieces. I like the Padauk for the main fact of having the red accent wood for Christmas. These house shaped advent calendars have now become quite a popular item on my online store. This is a project for intermediate to advanced woodworkers and requires patience and the proper tools. With the trial and error process that I worked through over the past year, I think I have worked out all the bugs to make these a sturdy and long lasting family heirloom.\nI have included the drawing plans with material list and templates for easy reference.", "title": "Wood House Advent Calendar", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Wood-House-Advent-Calendar/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "6 \u00bd\u201d x 12 foot rough 4/4 Maple wood (or any type of light coloured wood)\n6\u201d x 4 foot rough 4/4 Padauk wood (or darker accent wood of your choice)\n24\u201d x 24\u201d piece of 1/8\u201d hardboard\n5/8\u201d pre-cut wood numbers for the doors (Stockade.ca)\n25 \u2013 \u00bc\u201d x 1\u201d Wood Axel Pegs (Stockade.ca)\n5 \u2013 1/8\u201d x 12 5/8\u201d steel rod (Hinge Rods)\n25 - #4 thin Washers\n1 \u2013 Keyhole Slot Plug (Lee Valley #05H03.01)\n1 \u2013 Battery Operated Tea Light\nMaple Veneer (optional)\nGorilla Super Glue\nWood Glue\nHot Melt Glue Gun with clear glue\nClear Polyurethane Satin Finish\nDrill Press with Fence and stop block\nTable Saw\nMiter Saw\nRouter\n3/8\u201d Dado blade or router bit\n\u00bc\u201d Round-over Router Bit\n5/8\u201d Forstner bit\n1 \u00bd\u201d Forstner bit\nLots of Clamps", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQE/5P0F/JTMSHOKG/FQE5P0FJTMSHOKG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Materials & Equipment Needed:"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Prepare your parts for the main case, dividers and roof from maple.

The round-over allows the doors to open properly without the edge rubbing against the frames. It is easier to rout this round-over on the long strips than trying to do each door individually.\nSand the strips before cutting into length for the doors. Sanding before cutting takes away a bit of the work load when finish sanding the doors. Cut the doors to 2 3/16\u201d long on the miter saw. Make sure you put the square side of the doors to the miter saw fence and have a zero clearance backerboard against the fence to prevent any tearout on the doors. Alternatively, you can cut your long strips 2 \u00bc\u201d wide then after the doors have all been cut you can trim each door down to the final width. This will skim off any tearout you may get. It is good practice to make several extra doors for test drilling the hinge holes later on.

For the case sides, you need to cut a 3/16\u201d x 3/8\u201d rabbit on each inside end of the sides and a 3/16\u201d x 3/16\u201d rabbit along inside back of each side and case bottom.

You may need to pull them apart after dry-fitting to make adjustments. The dadoes also need to be flush on the outer edges when put together. The drawings show the exact location of each dado.\nSelect the edges that you will want to have toward the front of the calendar. Flip over and mark the back sides. Since the dadoes are on reverse edges for the horizontal and vertical dividers, it will make it easier for cutting the proper side on the table saw. I prefer using my dado set on the table saw as each groove can be done in one pass. If you prefer to use your router, and have a long enough 1/4\" straight router bit, you will need to cut in increments.

These will be done on the horizontal dividers only and the top and bottom pieces. Placement of these holes is key and must be accurate to ensure the rods go straight through the case. For the top and bottom pieces, the holes will be 3/16\u201d deep. I go to my drill press for this job and utilize my fence and a stop block. The holes are 3/16\u201d from the front edge of the dividers and top and bottom pieces. The left side holes are 3/8\u201d from outside edge and the subsequent holes are 3/16\u201d to the right of the divider dadoes. Set your fence so that the center of the bit is 3/16\" from your fence. I designed a template from 1/8\u201d hardboard for this but it can easily be done by marking the center of the holes on each piece. If you plan on making more than one you may want to make a template or a jig to speed up this process. I drill each divider individually so the bit doesn't move or bend making the lower board holes crooked. You can mark and drill one, then use that piece as the template for marking the other dividers and top and bottom pieces. You can mark with a pencil, but I like to use the same size brad point drill bit and tap it lightly with the hammer through my template holes to give an indentation for the center. Another method I have done is by using my stop block. I mark one divider only, set my stop for the first hole and drill all the dividers and top and bottom pieces individually, then set the stop block for the second hole and repeat until all holes are drilled. This ensures ever hole is identical.\nFor the five hinge rods, I purchase 1/8\" steel rod in 48\" lengths from one of the home improvement box stores and cut it to length with my hack saw. The steel rods are the same lengths as the dividers, 12 5/8\".\nOnce the holes are drilled it would be a good time to do a dry fit. Assemble the dividers together. Just as a note, I don\u2019t glue them together as I try to keep them as snug as possible, so once your done dry fitting you can leave the divider assembly together, depending on how tight your fit is. When assembling you will need to clamp the dividers within the side pieces and clamp the top case piece in place, leaving the bottom off. Push your 1/8\u201d steel rod up from the bottom through each line of holes to see if they line up properly. You can use a small rasp or your 9/64\u201d drill bit in your hand drill to make the holes a bit bigger in any direction to ensure everything is going in straight. If the holes are slightly bigger than the 9/64\u201d it won\u2019t affect how the doors open.\nOnce you are satisfied you can glue up the case. Remember, don\u2019t glue on the bottom piece on yet. It needs to stay off to install the doors. Glue your dividers together first if required. Apply glue to the top edges of the divider assembly and clamp on the case top ensure front is flush. Let dry for about half an hour. Then repeat this process to attach both sides, applying glue to the dividers and end dadoes of the sides. Make sure front side is flush and the entire case is square. This is going to require a lot of clamps. When dry, remove from clamps and clean up any glue squeeze out. Sand joints and front of case with 220 grit paper as required.

Insert a 9/64\u201d drill bit into the drill press with about 1 \u00bc\u201d of the bit sticking out. This will help keep the bit straight while drilling. Also ensure your drill press bed is square to your bit and fence. Set up your fence on your drill press so the bit is lined up in the exact center of the door thickness. Next set up a stop block so your bit center is 3/16\u201d from the hinge side (rounded side) of the door. Make sure you have a few pieces cut the same size as your doors to run some test drilling. When you are perfectly lined up put your first door against the fence with the outside of the door facing out. You can only drill about halfway through the door at a time then you will need to flip it over and drill from the opposite end. If you try to go through the entire height of the door, the bit will usually go off on a bit of an angle. Drill the hole in increments. Only go in no more than \u00bc\u201d at a time, pull the bit out, clean off any material stuck on the bit, then continue drilling gradually until you are just past halfway of the door height. Trying to do too much at once causes the bit to heat up too much and can crack the wood. I like to keep a stiff paint brush handy for cleaning the bit. Now you need to flip your door over ensuring you are keeping the bit on the hinge side of the door. The inside of the door should now be facing you. Repeat the process as you did on the other side only drilling small amounts at a time. Continue until all 25 doors are drilled. To ensure the holes are straight and cleaned out well, I like to put the drill bit into my 12v cordless hand drill and ream the holes running the bit through the entirety of the hole. If you are slightly off angle with the holes you can use the bit to lightly ream them.

I used a piece of \u00bd\u201d MDF about 3\u201d x 12\u201d and drilled 5 \u2013 \u00bc\u201d holes in a row, about 2\u201d from the bottom. Spacing isn\u2019t important.

You may need to do a light sand of the case 45 angles at the top, and the outer gable edges and back panel to ensure they are smooth.\nNow you can glue on the roof assembly. Make sure the front of the roof is flush with the case front the the area that was taped during spray finishing is at the back. Apply glue along the angled edges of the gable and the angled corners on the top outside edges of the case. Clamp together making sure the entire assembly stays flat. Because the roof gable wants to pull up, make sure you clamp the gable and calendar case to your work bench to hold it down and keep it flat. Put a 1/16\" piece of scrap wood under the gable area before clamping to your bench as the back panel is recessed 1/6\".", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F51/YICV/JTON1V1K/F51YICVJTON1V1K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3B/FVOB/JTON2C0U/F3BFVOBJTON2C0U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB3/INS0/JTON2C0V/FB3INS0JTON2C0V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGI/CC2S/JTON2C0W/FGICC2SJTON2C0W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI3/KAI3/JTON2C1U/FI3KAI3JTON2C1U.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 15: Attaching Roof Assembly"}, {"step": 16, "steps_text": "While the case is drying you can cut the roof facia scallop pieces for the front of the roof edges. Cut 2 pieces from Padauk, \u00bc\u201d x 1\u201d x 11 7/8\u201d long. Cut 45 degree angles on one end of each piece. Print 2 copies of the attached drawing plans for a scaled template for the facia pieces. You can either use spray adhesive to attach the template to the wood or trace it out. The paper can easily be removed after cutting and a light sand removes any gum residue from the glue. Cut your scallops on the band saw or scroll saw and finish sand with 220 grit paper. An oscillating sander with a 1 1/2\" spindle makes sanding quite simple. Glue and clamp to front edges of roof ensuring pieces are even and line up straight at top. Leave an overhang on the flat side about 1/16\u201d past the roof. Make sure the facia doesn't block the top corner doors from opening properly.\nTIP: Depending on my material, I often cut the facia from a wider piece of stock, cut the scallops and sand the entire piece. Then I rip my 1/4\" pieces on the table saw. When cutting this way, it is safer to leave the one end square and cut the 45 degree angle after the individual pieces are cut. This makes it safer to rip giving you a square end to use a push block on the table saw.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBG/AV6T/JTON1VCJ/FBGAV6TJTON1VCJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F18/3RE0/JTON1VEW/F183RE0JTON1VEW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZK/P62N/JTON2PO4/FZKP62NJTON2PO4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVP/X0NN/JTON2PW7/FVPX0NNJTON2PW7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDY/2O0B/JTON2PXU/FDY2O0BJTON2PXU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 16: Roof Facia"}, {"step": 17, "steps_text": "To cut the Christmas tree for the top you will need some of the accent Padauk wood with maple accents. Or you can do in reverse with a maple tree with Padauk accents. Prepare your piece for the tree to around 3/16\u201d thick. You will use the attached plans again for the scaled template for the tree. Cut out the tree on a scroll saw (my preference) or band saw with a fine blade and sand to smooth all edges. Now you will cut some 1/8\u201d thick, or less, pieces of maple for the garland using the template to mark them on the maple. Cut with scroll or band saw. If you don\u2019t want them too thick you can use 1/16\u201d maple veneer and cut with a utility knife or scissors. If you pick up some pre-glued veneer edging you can attach by ironing on. Glue the garland to the tree with Gorilla Super Glue. This part doesn\u2019t have to be exact to the plans. Feel free to be inventive. Drill a number of 1/8\u201d holes through the tree between the garland. This allows a bit of the light from the tea candle to glow through giving the appearance of ornaments on the tree.\nThere are other options for the decorative accent for the candle holder. Ready made wood cutouts can be purchased through various online stores like Stockade.ca. They have numerous Christmas options, i.e. Christmas trees, Reindeer, Wreaths\u2026 Remember these will be done in a white wood, so if you want the Padauk wood you will have to cut them yourself.\nTo hold the candle, cut a piece of maple to the size specified in the cut list. Using a 1 \u00bd\u201d forstner bit, drill a hole in the center of the piece. This can go all the way through or not, depending on the depth of your tea light. Ensure the tea light you purchase will fit in the hole. I have had issues with them being a bit too large. Glue the candle base to the bottom back of the tree ensuring bottoms are flush.\nOnce your tree/candle holder is dry, scrape out any glue squeeze-out, lightly sand and apply 2-3 coats of polyurethane. Finish sand the tree/candle holder prior to attachment. Attach with the Gorilla Super Glue in the center of the roof gable area.

I was in need of additional ports for a third external drive, a printer, and then of course jump drives. I searched around online, but everything I liked was an overpriced aluminum strip or block, which would just clutter up desk space. It's bad enough that I'm spatially taunted by a random drink coaster ... wait a minute ... I can combine two annoying things into one useful thing.\n\nIt just so happened that a concrete USB hub challenge was taking place on YouTube (circa 2016), which resulted in many creative designs:\nLawing: Desk orgainizer/holding thingy\nJackman: Electronic device storage shelf\nKage: Side table\n\nAt first, the idea of concrete was of no interest to me, but further contemplation swayed my opinion. A concrete coaster would be impervious to both hot and cold beverages and the weight would keep it from dancing around while inserting cables and drives. Also, it could be used to bludgeon zombies once the apocalypse happens.\n\nFor shape, I decided to go with a shallow block - just thick enough to encapsulate the USB hub.\n\nFor the actually Hub, I chose a 7 port octopus (octopod?) style. I guess the male connector counts as the 8th arm? This style allows me to distribute the ports across three sides of the block.\n\nFor design, I decided to try an epoxy inlay ... in the shape of an 8-bit skull.", "title": "The 8-Bit Skull Concrete USB Hub", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/The-8-Bit-Skull-Concrete-USB-Hub/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The key to concrete casting, aside from an adequate mix, is a quality form.

I happened to have some melamine left over from when I made my large router/assembly/outfeed table.\n\nI sliced a length from the larger sheet using a circular saw and shop made saw track. I further reduced this using the miter saw and then cut my final parts using the table saw. A sharp blade and applying painters tape within your cutting path will greatly minimize melamine chip out.\nBottom: 5 1/2\" x 5 1/2\"\nSides: 9\" x 2\".\n\nIn true BALES fashion, I obsessively laid out screw locations on the four sides. They don't need to be perfectly spaced since this is just a form, but that's how my brain works. Holes were drilled using a countersink bit and then a 1/8\" bit. Within one of the sides, I drilled a recess for the male connector of the USB hub [Fig. 7]. This will keep that part outside of the final concrete cast.\n\nI assembled the form on a flat surface and even used a clamp to ensure the sides were flush. It's a good idea to label the side which will entomb the male USB connector, so that during demolding, you don't pry on that side like a barbarian and destroy everything.

I was thinking about running out to get some angle steel, when I remembered the \u201cwaste\u201d material I had hacked out of the shelving frame. Bolting the steel I had cut out when liberating the longer sections across the rail joint provided the needed rigidity - looking down the assembled rails showed them to be dead-straight. Since I had fitted both the upper and lower rails with the aluminum, I left the aluminum in place on the lowers, as those won\u2019t have any vertical stress on them and may add some horizontal stability.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FH2/7G67/JTOMWQC8/FH27G67JTOMWQC8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHM/4P8S/JTOMWPIC/FHM4P8SJTOMWPIC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTM/BC0C/JTOMWPDP/FTMBC0CJTOMWPDP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Engineering"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The frame assemble with only the addition of two new holes, and used the original screws from the shelving unit, except to attach the stabilizing pieces, at the joint in the rails. Consideration for this part of the assembly was to have a completely flat surface on the top and inside of the upper rails, to not interfere with movement of the sled (more on that later).\nThe back side of the original unit was about four inches taller than the front, so one of the frames (bottom) ended up being longer than the upper. I could have trimmed the longer pieces; but thought that the added length might provide a little additional strength to keep from bending the frame due to the leverage amplified by long risers.\nI lined up the upper and lower (with the aluminum) frames to determine where to drill the holes for the risers, disassembled the frames and drilled holes on the drill press, working up to 3/8\".", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFH/Q8TP/JTOMWPRF/FFHQ8TPJTOMWPRF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Frame Assembly"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Since the shelving unit was built with the shelving unit inside the vertical components (now my horizontal rails), the shelf unit was sized to fall between the rails.\nI cut out the wire mesh between the cross members with the bolt cutter, filed them and then used two more of the remaining short cut-off sections from the disassembly for the ends of the sled. The distance between the long sides was measured to fit my router base well and allow freedom of movement.\nSince the long sides of the sled are the same width as the \u2018box\u2019 the ends of the sled will sit directly on the top rails of the box. To help reduce friction when the sled is on the box, I used thin strips cut from an old plastic cutting board (another thrift store find); it doesn\u2019t matter how thick these are, as long as they are the same. A plywood base was attached to the sides (only) and the plastic strips attached to the runners using epoxy and also screwed the plywood to the frame. I hit the plastic sliders with 220 sandpaper to remove any ridges allowing a smoother ride down the rails.\nThe sled was now ready for my router \u2013 almost. I have a 2\u201d flattening bit for my router, with a 2\u201d shaft extension. I didn\u2019t want to modify one of my factory parts for the router so made a sub-base specifically for this bit. From the same cutting board, I cut a square to fit the router diameter, then cut a 2\u201d hole through the base with a hole saw on the drill press. This is an easier task in concept than execution, as the plastic melts and gums up everything pretty quickly. This melting property actually turned out to be a benefit, as the 2\u201d hole turned out to be a bit larger \u2013 enough to accommodate the 2\u201d bit without interference. You\u2019ll need to do a little clean-up on the hole to remove the solidified plastic blobs, a knife, file and sandpaper do the job in short order. I left this base square to keep it from twisting on the sled \u2013 I don\u2019t know if this is helpful or not, the router will stay in it\u2019s orientation; but, I won\u2019t be able to turn it for comfort during use, it\u2019s a matter of preference I suppose..\nOh, and there\u2019s another thrift store treasure. I picked up this adjustable light for $4 and clamped it to the bench between the drill press and bench band saw. It swivels and adjusts to work for both.\nI\u2019m not overly concerned with seeing the router working the wood for this application, so the opaque plastic and plywood sled are OK here. There\u2019s a big slot in the sled to see what has happened, and this is not detail work.\nHere, I'm going to jump ahead a little, while we're talking about the sled build... During the first couple of test passes with the system, I noticed the upper frame was spreading outward in the center. This was fixed by attaching angle aluminum to the sled, to keep the lateral forced from dropping that 2\u201d flesh destroyer, unexpectedly. The overhang is just enough to keep the sled on the tracks. I should probably mention the plastic runners work great for reducing friction, the sled will slide from one end of the box to the other with just a 12 inch incline \u2013 waxed rails don\u2019t hurt either.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYN/X59I/JTOMWQIJ/FYNX59IJTOMWQIJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL9/1BXP/JTMT0SZ7/FL91BXPJTMT0SZ7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLE/KDDI/JTMT0T0U/FLEKDDIJTMT0T0U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWE/H0MP/JTMT0T3M/FWEH0MPJTMT0T3M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ2/KH01/JTOMWQ11/FZ2KH01JTOMWQ11.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Building the Sled"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "I purchased two six foot 3/8-16 threaded rods for use as the risers. Initially, I had planned for four 2\u2019 risers (on the corners only). After assembly and putting the weight of the router onto the sled, I decided to put another set of risers at the joint of the horizontal sections (the middle) to eliminate potential sag. (It\u2019s inevitable that at least some body weight is going to provide some additional downward force). I cut four 1\u201d x 3\u201d pieces from some old steel framing brackets I had from a deck project. These were drilled to attach to the frame reinforcements in the middle of the rails on one end and to fit the riser rods on the other ends. These sit outside of the main frame to all the sled to move the entire length of the box without interference.\nI used hex nuts and washers to attach the risers to the lower frame and out-riggers (one nut and washer set below and one set above) \u2013 tight but not crushing, and a set of wing nut and washer above and below the rail frame on each riser for height adjustments and leveling when the system is being set up to use. The wing nuts at the top corners also serve as stops and keep the bit from coming in contact with the frame.\nAs mentioned previously, I had applied wax to the sled runners, I also applied a couple of coats to the upper frame rails to help things slide around more freely.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWG/EYB0/JTON05U6/FWGEYB0JTON05U6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV5/79M3/JTON05PP/FV579M3JTON05PP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Risers"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "For demonstration purposed for this Instructable, I went out to my wood pile to grab a log to work.

This process makes a big mess!\nThe log I chose was ~2\u2019 x 10\u201d and had been cut long enough ago that it was starting to show some evidence of deterioration. Before doing anything with an expensive router bit, I used a draw knife to remove nearly all of the bark from the log \u2013 a couple of reasons for this, first to remove the potentially bit damaging crud that lives in bark (the draw knife is easy to sharpen) and second, to try to minimize the number of little critters living in the bark from being flung into all the hard to reach places in my shop.

I screwed together a couple of scraps to cradle the log and keep it from wobbling.\nAfter stabilizing the stock, you will need to lower the upper rails to just above where you will engage the wood with the router by spinning the lower wing nuts down (or up) to support the rails at the desired level. Use a long level to span across two points and lock those into place, tightening the upper wing nuts; then level the rest of the rails from there. It is important to make sure that all connections are tight, to minimize wobble and tilt - double check the riser feet and end bars, immobilizing each of these junctions. The set up presented here is surprisingly stable, even with the upper rails at the full two feet elevation.

I found I could cut about \u00bc inch at a time as long as I worked from the outside toward the center and taking \u00bd-1\u201d passes \u2013 not more than \u00bd the width of the bit. If you start out in the middle (like cutting a dado) you may run into some shifting and control issues, depending on your depth. I used the plunge base for my router, to let me make multiple passes on the log before having to adjust the risers and level the rails again.

It is because it is the first start of the motorcycle after rebuild and it still has to evacuate some humidity from the cylinder and the fogging oil I used into the cylinder ;)", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: The Project Video (timelapse)"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Before detailing each step of my Instructable, I wanted to tell you guys what you need to know in order to make a junkyard motorcycle run again: what do you absolutely need to check? how much does it cost? how \"easy\" is it?\nIf you find yourself with a junkyard bike, or a bike that hasn't run in many years, there are some key components that you'll absolutely need to go through in order to be able to ride it again:\n- Engine: Without an engine, you can't ride. You'll want to determine if the engine is seized (pistons can't move at all) or fine. If the engine is seized, you'll most likely have to rebuilt it and open it up, if not, you can probably just restart following the step I go through in the upcoming steps of this instructables.\n- Final Transmission: the final transmission is what will allow you to transfer the power from the engine to the rear wheels. Most of the motorcycles use chain, some do have shaft drives. If your motorcycle has a chain, best thing will just be to replace it, old chains are often corroded and damaged, and a new one will only cost around $25 to $50\n- Wheels & Suspension: this is a crucial part because they are the contact surface of your motorcycle to the road. On old bike that has been stored for decades, you'll have to change the fork oil and seals, it is not difficult to do and pretty cheap, about $10 for the seals and $15 for the new oil. As for the shocks, it is often better to replace them, but once again, you can find new replacement shock for just about any bike for under $100, so less than the price of having the old shocks rebuilt.\nFor the wheels and tires, most of the time, wheels will likely be fine, except for spoked wheel like on my 350 Four, which will probably be rusty and need to be replaced. Tires however will almost always have to be replaced, remember that a tire lifespan is 6years, even if the bike is not riding during that time (which is actually worse for a tire) because the rubber will harden causing slipping especially in corner. So never try to ride on old tires, always replace them, it is a matter of safety, and most of the time new tires will cost less than $150\n- Brakes: Finally, THE most important part on a motorcycle, its brake. On an old bike, it is always better to restore the brake, that is to say change the brake pads (or shoes for a drum brake) and change the brake fluid (it needs to be changed every 2 years because of humidity in it). You'll likely need to rebuild the master cylinder too with new seals, or maybe you'll just want to change it for new one. Brakes pad or shoes will cost around $20 per brake, brake fluid $10, and a master cylinder rebuild kit, or a new universal master cylinder around $50.\nOn disc brakes, it is also a good idea to replace the old rubber brake lines with new one, stainless steel brake lines are great upgrade and not too expensive.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F4H/C24R/JTOMX9YJ/F4HC24RJTOMX9YJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Preambule : What Does It Takes to Make a Motorcycle Run Again?"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "So, this is the bike I decided to save, the one in which I believed had a lot of potential!\nIt is a 1973 (I think from the chassis number) Honda CB 350 Four, the smallest one of the Honda CB Four series, it was only produced from 1972 to 1974 so it is not a very common bike.\nBut what liked about this bike was especially this! having a 350cc 4 cylinder is VERY uncommon, it's not something you see everyday and just a few models of such small 4 cylinder motorcycle were actually massed produced.\nThe bike condition:\nWhen I got the bike, it was pretty much a wreck, it didn't run for at least 30 years, so the engine needed to be fully inspected and restarted, it had no brakes at all, and overall, was in a terrible condition: corrosion everywhere, the gas tank had a lot of dents everywhere, the forks and shocks had no oil left at all inside them because they were leaking... so everything had to be rebuilt.\nThe motorcycle also shown many signs of crashs, so I believe a crash may have been the initial reason why this bike has been put away many many years ago. The speedometer had dents, the lower tripple clamp had a broken \"turn stopping part\" which can only happen in a nasty crash, and many parts were missing, like electrical compoments, brake parts, etc. So I believed people then came to pick up parts on this bike when it was stored.\nI could tell that the bike had not been run for a long period of time when I pulled the fuel petcock off the bike and oppened it, well first of all it broke, but inside of it,was a lot of solid dirt!! the gas that was once in the tank sat there for so long it turned into solid chunks of dirt!\nSo now that I got the bike, it was time to restore it, and my first goal was to make that little engine run again!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFL/V3DQ/JTMSYN6F/FFLV3DQJTMSYN6F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI4/QW9H/JTMSYN25/FI4QW9HJTMSYN25.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCY/ZT1V/JTMSYN3B/FCYZT1VJTMSYN3B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMC/2R2V/JTMSYN3C/FMC2R2VJTMSYN3C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU8/KTF4/JTMSYN2Q/FU8KTF4JTMSYN2Q.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: The Motorcycle to Be Saved"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Here we are, probably the most exciting part of this restoration: start the engine again. I actually wanted to try to restart an old engine for a very long time, it was a challenge I always wanted to take :)\nSo, when trying to restart an engine, it is crucial to know what actualy allows an engine to run! what does it need?\nWell it is actually pretty simple, it needs:\nFuel\nAir\nSpark\nFree moving parts (piston, crankshaft, etc.)\nLets start by the \"free moving parts\", it just means that the engine must not being \"seized\", aka the piston can move freely inside the cylinder, and others partks like the crankshaft are fine too. When I got the bike, I tried to gently crank it with the kickstarter and immediatly saw that it was not seized and that it could turn easily, so this part was good!\nThen, for the fuel and air, those 2 depends on the carburetor, it is the carburetor that will bring the correct fuel/air mixture to the engine, so the first step here was to entirely rebuild the carburetors.\nAnd finally, for the sparks: there are several component needed for a proper spark: spark plugs, plug caps, coils, points, condenser, etc. A single faulty part would cause no spark at all, and those parts are actually pretty cheap, so best thing is just to replace all of them, which I did (except for the coils because I tested them and they were still good).\nNow, let's start with the carburetor rebuild:\nThe 350 Four has 4 carbs, one for each cylinder, and any bike that sat for more than a year or two will need a full carb cleaning, and most likely rebuild too, because old gas tend to turn into \"gum\" and block the tiny ports. Moreover, old seals and O-ring will harden with time and cause leaks.\nFor rebuilding the carbs, I started by taking the 3 carbs aparts and down to pieces, removing as much parts as possible for better cleaning, there were a lot of aluminium oxyde inside the carbs, it was crazy!\nThen, I had the carbs ultrasonic cleaned, 6 times actually, ultrasonic cleaning is a very effective to clean carburetors. It's the best method I found so far.\nFinally, I put the carbs back together using a rebuild kit, that is to say new seals, o-ring, needles, jets, etc.\nThis alone took me a lot of time, you need to be very careful not to mix parts between the carbs and put them back in the correct order. I'd say that rebuilding the carbs alone probably took me 8 hours.\nLet's head back onto the engine:\nOkay so now that we have a correct air/fuel supply to the engine, we need a spark!!\nSo to get a proper spark, I start by removing the old points (aka. contact breakers) and condenser, they were so old the points did not made proper contact and did not allow current to pass through. If you are not familiar with points, it is what was used on old bikes before electronic ignition came around to determine when to trigger the spark on the cylinders. It is directly related to the crankshaft which tell the points were the pistons are in the cylinder.\nSo after replacing the points, it is crucial to set the ignition timing by turning the crankshaft to certain marks, which indicate certain positions of the pistons, and adjust the points accordingly. It is not a difficult task, you just need to be patient and have a static timing light. I actually made one with a 12v led and 2 alligator clips lol\nNow, before even trying to start this engine, it absolutely needed new oil, you can't run an engine that hasn't started in decades, which 30y/o oil. So I drained the old oil and changed the oil filter, then poured in some cheap fresh oil because I only planned to run the engine for 15min on that oil before changing it again! I also added some \"Engine clean\" oil additive to help remove dirt and debris from the engine.\nI then replaced all 4 spark plugs, installed new plugs caps and... we were good to go!!\nSo.. did it run?? I'd say watch the video and find out ;)\nSpoiler alert: It did!!\nTo make it start again, I hooked up a battery, fuel supply line to the carbs, and starting cranking it!\nI eventually restarted, with a TON of SMOKE!! it was crazy!! all the smoke was coming from the \"carbon goo\" inside the cylinders, the carbon had mixed with humidity and created a kind of goo, which had to be burnt off.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8W/F6V8/JTOMX9W6/F8WF6V8JTOMX9W6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA9/TZH7/JTIYMI3E/FA9TZH7JTIYMI3E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWW/86WS/JTIYMI3H/FWW86WSJTIYMI3H.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Breathe Life Into the Engine Again"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Restarting the engine was a first step... but to be able to ride a bike, you need to be able to sit on it, to transfer the engine's power to the rear wheel, and moreover, to be able able to stop it ^^ as Jeremy Clarkson once said: \"Speed has never killed anyone. Suddenly becoming stationary, that's what gets you\"\nSo we need proper suspension, final transmission, tires and, well, brakes!\nLet's start with suspension:\nThe old rear shocks were entirely corroded and spongy, best thing was just to replace them with new ones, and since I planned on making this bike a scrambler, I installed new, slightly longer shock that has compression and rebound adjustments for maximum comfort.\nAs for the fork, they were out of oil because of the damaged fork oil seals, so I pulled them apart, cleaned everything, changed the oil seals, and poured in fresh 15w oil. I used 15w grade oil because that's \"heavier\" than the old oil, so the benefits from heavier oil will be stiffer forks, which is always a nice benefit on those old bikes.\nNow, the transmission:\nThe final drive chain is what transfer power from the gearbox to the rear wheel. The old chain was just dead, plain and simple, plus someone, for an unknown reason, had remove the master link clip so the chain could just snap at any minute. So here again, the only option was just to replaced the chain, I also replaced the front sprocket during the process.\nHow about the tires?\nWould it be fine to ride a bike with cracked, hard, old tires and corroded rims and spokes? well, actually, no!!\nSo I also changed the rims, tires and spokes, aka. I re-laced the wheels. The only parts I kept were the wheel hubs.\nHere is a tip: if you want to change your spokes, rim and tire, you actually do not need to bother removing the tire and spokes, which can be pretty hard. You can just cut the spokes lol, you are going to ditch them anyway, this will make you save a lot of time!\nOnce you have just the wheel hub, you need to re-lace and true the wheel, it was the first time I did this, and looked for tutorials online. It is actually not very difficult to do, and does not require special tools, maybe just a spoke wrench. However, it does requires A LOT of time and patience. So my advice for this is just take your time, don't rush it, even if you are frustrated when truing the wheel, because once you mount the tire back on, it'll be a PITA to have to do everything all over again.\nFinally, the brakes!\nNow, the most important part! the CB350F has a rear drum brake, and a disc front brake, both of which did not work on my bike.\nThe rear brake was a pretty easy fix, the missing parts were only the spring & nuts that connect the brake rotor to the brake lever on the wheel, so I just bought new one and connected them back. I also bought new brake shoes, but the old shoes were actually in very good shape! so I just kept the new ones as spares ones.\nFor the front brake, well all the brake fluid leaked out, so no wonder it didn't work, plus the brake pads were worn out. So, I did not bother trying to rebuild the master cylinder (which was probably the faulty part) but just replaced with a new one, that looked a lot better, master cylinders are pretty cheap nowadays. I also replaced the old brake line that was cracked, with a brand new stainless steel braided brake line, I then installed the new brake pads, poured in new brake fluid, bleed the brake, and VOILA !\nBonus tip : How to bleed brake easily.\nBleeding brake is often seen as an annoying thing, that often requires 2 people. Actually most of the time, bleeding brakes only takes me about 20 min.\nWhat I do is I just pour brake fluid in the master cylinder's reservoir, then, before even trying to bleed the system, I just open the nipple on the caliper then with through a (at least 50cm long) transparent hose, I suck air out, either with a syringe... or my mouth lol, and you'll see the brake fluid level go down in the master cylinder's reservoir. Do this few times, then you can start bleeding the brakes normally, and you'll see that it'll be much faster!\nHow to bleed brakes? pretty easy: pump the lever with one hand, then press it, with the other end open (for 2 sec) the nipple on the caliper, then close it, and then release the lever. Repeat until no air bubbles comes out and brake lever is very stiff!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGB/Z4WN/JTIYMI3M/FGBZ4WNJTIYMI3M.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Make It Rideable Again"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "When I had the idea of restoring and re purposing this bike, I didn't plan on restoring it as original.\nToo many original parts were severely damaged or corroded for this, and those original are extremely expensive, the exhaust system for example, that broke in 2 pieces because of rust, cost $1500 alone!!\nPlus, I wanted this bike to be even more \"all purpose\", to be able to ride on the streets, but also be able to go on dirt roads in the countryside!\nSo I decided to make this bike a scrambler!!\nWhat is a scrambler? it is basically an old school trail bike, most of the time, they are street bike that are re purposed to ride on both street and dirt roads.\nWhat does your bike needs to be a scrambler? well, first of all, the tires, it needs dual purpose tires with knobs, so you can ride the bike in the dirt. Then it is also a good idea to upgrade the suspension, which I did, and also maximize ground clearance, especially by avoiding \"low exhaust\". Foam air filters are also a good idea, but for occasional ride in the dirt, well oiled and maintained \"K&N style\" filters can work too, just make sure to clean and oil them often (on every dirt ride).\nSo I wanted to re purpose this bike as a scrambler but also make it look really cool! so here is what I did to achieve a new clean look:\nI sanded down the frame and re-painted in black, I also painted the wheels hub in black to contrast with the new chrome rims and spoke. Installed enduro tires that are great for both road and dirt. I also painted the fork in black and installed fork boots in order to protect the from dust and give it a cleaner look.\nI had the gas tank painted in Red to contrast with the rest of the bike.\nI wanted to have a very shinny and clean engine, so I spent a lot of time cleaning the original parts, I actually did not repaint any of those!! I used mostly steel wool to clean and polish the chrome and aluminium parts of the engine. Steel wool is really great and better than sandpaper because it will not scratch the parts like sandpaper does, and it also make them shine :)\nAnd I also changed many parts like handlebars, grips, levers, etc. to match the rest of the bike and changed about every nut and bolt with new stainless steel ones.\nBut one thing I like a lot on this bike is my custom hand made seat that I built entirely myself!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYS/SPUN/JTMSYQOA/FYSSPUNJTMSYQOA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTB/HMIW/JTMSYQOC/FTBHMIWJTMSYQOC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7Q/OWO4/JTMSYQQ0/F7QOWO4JTMSYQQ0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSY/VBZD/JTMSYQP6/FSYVBZDJTMSYQP6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQA/8264/JTMSYQRF/FQA8264JTMSYQRF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Giving It a New Pretty Body & Style"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Now it is time to enjoy that salvaged bike and make it ride again on the street it probably rode on about 40 years ago!\nI always find it satisfying and impressive to think that a vehicle that is almost twice your age can still run after a restoration.\nI think we probably all have already seen or knew someone who had a junk motorcycle sitting and rotting in their backyards for decades, now you know that it can always be restored and you know what are the main steps you need to go through to make a bike run again!\nBut remember to always ride safe!! before the first ride (and also every other ride), make sure all the bolts are secure, brakes are working, tire pressure is good, etc.!

It means when they are stretched in one direction, they expand in the other direction.\" Cool huh? Well, we believe that the smartness in the behavior of this metamaterials is very potent in creating shape-change and adaption.\n\nInspiration:\nOf course, due to the science-based nature of this project, we are not the inventors of auxetics. Auxetics was first invented in 1978 by the Berlin researcher K. Pietsch. Since then, researchers continued working on this topic, one of my favorites is this one by MIT Media Lab so far:\nKinetix - MIT Media Lab\n\nContribution:\nHowever, our contribution to this scientific research is to continue exploring their behavior on a larger scale and possibly defining functionality while integrating fabrication techniques and material properties.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLL/SM28/JTMSF8WX/FLLSM28JTMSF8WX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Aim"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Tools:\nFirst of all, download the file ( it basically helps you to know the size of each wood piece and where there should be rigid/flexible joints) .

I attached a link for downloading here:\nRhinoceros 6 download\nDesign process:\nIn our study case, there is a higher level of dependency between design, structure, and material. Since the behavior of the chair and the right choice of material and geometry are interdependent, our design process starts digitally. We started by exploring different 2d patterns and their deformations, in order to achieve an auxetic behavior.\nAs you can see in the third image, we can break down our design into 3 main parts: rigid body, rigid joints, and elastic joints. The amount of elasticity of the flexible joints, size of the rigid body units and stiffness of the rigid joints were all parameters which needed to be taken into consideration in order to achieve the desired deformation.\n\nSimulation:\nWe also did a rough deformation analysis was also done with KIWI!3d ( grasshopper plugin) in order to have a better estimation of the expected deformation.\nResult:\nHowever, the result was a fairly good start point to understand the behavior in a more tangible way, but we soon realized that physical prototyping was a better approach to anticipate and test the ideas than digital simulation.

It was also a given that a huge amount of spatial change was achieved with a minimum force. Although the first prototype with one 2D unit was not the design goal for the chair, it has the most spatial change.\nThen we continued the prototyping process by connecting two units together in xy plane. The same amount of deformation freedom was achieved since the units were not constrained in 3D, so as a more pleasant design. This prototype also demonstrated the spatial potential of creating positive and negative spaces.

The materials we used can be listed as below:\nwood glue\nmetal hinges (27)\nscrews\nsilicon rubber\nshrinking tube + lighter ( for micro scale)\ndried timber wood (3mm*1mm* (n)mm)\nFor a rigid body of the structure, wood can perform well for the rigid body of the structure as well as the rigid joints where there is a lot of force concentration. For the elastic parts, silicon rubber is applicable since it gives freedom to move and also transfers forces between elements. Regarding materials we are using, our method would include two main steps first is to cut the wood pieces in the desired shapes for both rigid body and rigid joints(making whole rigid parts) then doing final assembly by connecting elastic parts.\nAssembly tools:\n\nOur tools for assembly which are shown in the photo are consist of wood glue, metal hinges, rubber, screws, and screwdriver. Gluing rigid joints is the first step of the assembly where rigid body woods are connecting to rigid joint cubes with a male/female joinery system. After all the rigid joineries were done pieces were put together regarding our design and places where flexible joints are happening were marked. Metal hinges are screwed to the edges of wood sticks. Hinges are keeping the rigid parts together while they have the flexibility of movement in one axis which results in the final movement of the whole system.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYZ/CYHH/JTMSFCC7/FYZCYHHJTMSFCC7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKY/473T/JTMSFCCZ/FKY473TJTMSFCCZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7W/FJZB/JTMSFCEZ/F7WFJZBJTMSFCEZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI5/PYPD/JTMSFCDQ/FI5PYPDJTMSFCDQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJQ/4CMU/JTMSFCDV/FJQ4CMUJTMSFCDV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0H/LIXI/JTMSFCDY/F0HLIXIJTMSFCDY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCS/TQ0F/JTMSFCET/FCSTQ0FJTMSFCET.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGR/UB2W/JTMSFCBV/FGRUB2WJTMSFCBV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Fabrication and Assembly"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBA/DUXY/JTMSFDCV/FBADUXYJTMSFDCV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOT/G277/JTMSFDDT/FOTG277JTMSFDDT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Final Product"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Maybe it is not the most comfortable chair now, but for us this project was more or less a proof of concept for a conceptual drift in designing shape changing furniture, and considering our limited time and student budget we decided to go for bigger units, which means bigger holes and less chance to be comfortable while sitting on it!\nHowever, considering the unit based nature of this design proposal, it is believed that a human interaction approach is a great match for this research.

I am humbled that you were compelled enough to click on my link to learn this simply made, yet beautiful rack (yes I am bias). It all started about a year ago when my wife needed a shoe rack, but all the ones that looked solid built cost an arm and a leg, so, I figured I would just build one. Midway through the project we both realized it looked like a total piece of trailer trash even with us being rednecks! So she gave up, which in turn, made me want to prove her wrong, because that\u2019s marriage, and this could be awesome! So with a little outside the box thinking, black screws opposed to gold, and the beautiful addition of scrap steel as the shelving, voila, my rustic steel combo was born. That lead to multiple experiments and variations, including this one, as it is the first I have built! So it has been fun, but I assure you I am NOT a YouTube worthy wood craftsman, nor do I claim what I do is correct, but it works, so if you will humor me and take a shot, I bet you can make it better than I can. Also I am doing all of this from my iPad so bear with my splleing and punctuaytiom.\n\nSince the challenge was organization, I wanted to modify my standard coat rack to be more...multipurpose.

I have a very small workshop so I thought making a mobile base would be a much better option.\nMaterials Used:\n2x CLS - 63mm x 38mm x 2400mm\n6mm Plywood\n18mm Plywood\nCastors\nPocket Hole Screws\nWood Screws\nWashers\nTools Used:\nMitre Saw\nTable Saw\nDrill & Driver\nPocket Hole Jig", "title": "Simple DIY Mobile Tool Base", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-DIY-Mobile-Tool-Base/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I start the project by cutting the CLS to length at the mitre saw. The cut list makes this process simple. I don't have to think too much. I just measure the length I need to cut, mark it and then cut. This cut list is obviously to fit the BS350S but you can adapt it to any size you like.\nTo join the CLS together I opted to use Pocket Hole joinery. This is done by drilling holes using a Pocket Hole Jig and then fastening the wood together with Pocket Hole Screws. Don't worry if you don't have a Pocket Hole Jig. You can simple join the wood with regular wood screws. Drill a pilot hole first and then fasten the pieces together with screws.\nThe grey dots represents where the Pocket Holes need to be drilled. I used 64mm Pocket Hole Screws to fasten the joints together. The colour coding should hopefully help show how the pieces go together. Its a simple procedure of screwing the parts together to make the frame.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQA/I6AH/JROTOXNU/FQAI6AHJROTOXNU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOK/WQIF/JROTOYYR/FOKWQIFJROTOYYR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZE/76PO/JROTOYFO/FZE76POJROTOYFO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7Z/AZDQ/JROTOYHG/F7ZAZDQJROTOYHG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYL/A4W8/JROTOYHL/FYLA4W8JROTOYHL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEE/20BX/JROTOYHM/FEE20BXJROTOYHM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUF/6BZV/JROTOY18/FUF6BZVJROTOY18.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRH/2Q18/JROTOYHN/FRH2Q18JROTOYHN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYP/RQWE/JROTOYHO/FYPRQWEJROTOYHO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX4/TVYA/JROTOYHP/FX4TVYAJROTOYHP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLI/82G4/JROTOYHS/FLI82G4JROTOYHS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6I/HFMN/JROTOYJE/F6IHFMNJROTOYJE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Make the Frame"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "With the framework put together its time to cut the plywood to size.

I secured the top and bottom pieces to the frame using regular wood screws. I drilled pilot holes first to prevent the wood from splitting.\nNext task was to cut the 6mm plywood to size. I needed one piece at 540mm x 399mm. I also needed 2 pieces at 362mm x 399mm. These pieces will clad the outside of the frame. These also get attached using regular wood screws.

The castors have quite a large hole where the screws go so a regular head to a wood screw would just go right through it. Adding a washer helps to prevent this too.\nNow to put the bandsaw on the base. If you're moving heavy equipment make sure you lift it safely and always get someone to help you if you can. I secured the bandsaw in place using 100mm screws. These aren't ideal but they will do the job for me. I added a washer to them to help spread the load more evenly and help prevent the head of the screw squeezing through the holes on the base of the bandsaw.\nThat's the base done. Nice and simple but it does the job. It moves a lot easier now than it did on the original base. I am a little worried about it possibly tipping if I push heavier pieces through my bandsaw. If it does, I can always add some kick out legs to prevent it from tipping.

I actually got lucky a few months ago and found myself with a craft room of my own, and so decided that it was time to create exactly the table I always wanted.\nEqually as important as the tabletop space is the storage underneath...particularly storage space for very awkward items.\nI have an A3 guillotine, an A3 paper creaser, 3 long greeting card boxes, and a disassembled tabletop loom, and let me tell you that those things are a real pain to store! They are mostly long and thin which is why they do not fit on your normal shelves or in your normal cupboards. In my previous home, they had to be kept on top of tables, and that was really not a good solution because then there was no table space spare.\nSo I set about designing a table that was easy to build, as cheap as I could feasibly make it, and had storage areas underneath to keep all my awkward crafty things organised.\nIn order to keep the cost, time taken and the weight of the table to a minimum, a few parts are bought from IKEA. The areas that need to be custom sizes have been made by me and my helpful boyfriend (i.e. the owner of the power tools :))\nWe have not built furniture before so this is a pretty basic and simple build - and it proved to be a good starter project for woodwork newbies.\nI really hope you like what I've created, thanks for reading!", "title": "DIY Huge Sewing Table for a Craft Room | Custom Storage Shelving Unit", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Huge-Sewing-Table-for-a-Craft-Room-Custom-Stor/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "- Wood: I used 25 mm and 18 mm MDF, plus a piece of 3 mm hardboard. I wanted an even and smooth white finish so that it would match the white IKEA Kallax unit as closely as possible - meaning that all of the units would match in the final assembled table.\nYou could use plywood instead if you wished, or even a wood with a nice grain on it that you want to leave exposed and on display. It's up to you!\nI had the pieces cut out for me at B&Q (a DIY store in the UK) which was a huge help, and was vital for me as I don't have any other way of cutting wood pieces that big. I believe you would need a track or table saw to cut the pieces yourself.\n(Please see the next step for information on the sizes & dimensions of wood I needed.)\nIf you need to trim any wood pieces, you will also need a band saw, circular saw, or even a hand saw...or for small adjustments you could use a well-sharpened plane. Luckily, all of the wood pieces we had cut for us were accurate and so we didn't need to do any cutting ourselves.\n- Router: To make 'through dadoes' (grooves/slots) in the wood surface. The dadoes I cut were 5mm deep and 12 mm wide, so I used a 12 mm straight router bit. Your router cutter size will depend on the width of the dadoes you want to cut.\nIf you're in the U.S. you could use a table saw instead of a router.\n- Tape measure & ruler\n- Clamps\n- Hammer\n- Paint, Paintbrush, Roller & Tray: I bought some matte white MDF primer (by Dulux) and some 'white' spray paint. However, the spray paint turned out to be more of a creamy yellow colour, and so since the MDF primer was already a really good match for the white Kallax unit that we already had, we just ended up painting the whole thing with only the primer. Maybe not what you are supposed to do, but it is exactly the finish I wanted!\n- Masking tape\n- Sanding block & sandpaper (240 grit or so)\n- Breathing mask, safety specs, face shield & good ventilation; MDF dust is not good to breathe in, so you'll need these items particularly when cutting, driilling, sanding and painting.\n- Wood glue\n- Wood screws, plus a few washers.\n- Drill & drill bits; I used an electric drill and a pillar drill, along with drill bits of 1.5 mm, 4 mm & 6 mm.\n- Wooden dowels; The ones I used were 6 mm but I wouldn't go larger than that.\n- Scrap wood: To make various jigs, and also to join the tabletops together. These pieces were mostly made using MDF we had left over from the initial sheets we bought, plus some small pieces of plywood and pine scraps we already had.\n- Tabletops:I bought 2 IKEA Gerton tabletops, which are solid beech wood and measure 1550 x 750 mm each. Either find tabletops to make up the size of table you want, or of course you could make your own instead.\n- Filler & scraper tool (optional); I used a tiny amount of white Polyfilla to smooth the joins and the MDF edges at the front of the units.\n- Pencil\n- Kallax flat-pack unit from IKEA (optional) & Inserts: We used the Kallax as part of the assembled unit, but of course you could make everything from scratch instead if you wanted. I also bought 6 ready-made inserts from IKEA; 4 cupboard door inserts and 2 drawer inserts.\n- Felt pads; for underneath the units to protect the floor.\n- Wallpaper, wallpaper paste, bowl, wallpaper brush, glue, utility knife & scissors (optional); This is what I used to cover the hardboard backing, however you could just glue the wallpaper (or other decorative paper) on instead. This is an optional step, as you may decide you don't want a backing at all, or you could paint the board instead of papering it. Also note that you can just glue the wallpaper on if you don't have paste.\nCost\nI estimate that it cost me around \u00a3350 to make this table, with \u00a372 being spent on the wood (although I had a fair bit left over too), \u00a3150 on the tabletops, \u00a3110 on the Kallax and inserts from IKEA, and a little more spent on paint and bits 'n' pieces. The tools and other things we already had, such as the router, glue and Polyfilla.\nAlthough not cheap, I'm sure that if there was a product like this for sale it would be a lot more expensive, especially if it was custom built!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FW5/F6EP/JTEMYJ9T/FW5F6EPJTEMYJ9T.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: What You Will Need"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "You will first need to design your units to make sure it will fit in everything you want. In my case, I had to measure all of my most awkwardly shaped craft items and figure out how and where to fit them all in.\nI also needed to work out how high I wanted the table to be, considering I will mostly be standing up to use it, and also how big overall I want it to be. Once these dimensions are known, the sizes of the wood pieces you need can be calculated.\nDiagram 1: This shows a wide but quite shallow unit which will house my paper creaser at the top, my guillotine in the centre, and then at the bottom I wanted to be able to have 2 IKEA Kallax inserts. These inserts will be ready-made cupboard doors, as they are just easier and cheaper to buy than make to be honest! For these to fit, the opening needs to be 335 x 335 mm exactly. The narrow gap in between is just what is left over, but would be big enough for A4 paper/card.\nNote: In this unit only, I will be adding a hardboard backing. I have therefore made the top 2 shelves and the shelf dividers 5 mm shallower than the other sections. The effect will be that these pieces will be recessed at the back to create space for the hardboard back.\nDiagram 2: This shows a narrow but deep unit which will house my 3 long card boxes. As with the other unit I'm making, the sides are made from 25 mm MDF, the shelves are made from 12 mm MDF, and 5 mm deep dadoes (grooves) cut into the sides will hold the shelves.\nDiagram 3: This shows the pre-bought IKEA Kallax grid storage in grey, and then on top are the 2 blocks of 25 mm MDF that I'm going to need to add. This is mostly to make the 770 mm height of the Kallax up to the 850 mm height I want, but also to create more storage space in between these blocks that is long enough to house my loom pieces :)\nDiagram 4: This shows the cutting guide that I took to B&Q to get my wood pieces cut. On the left is the 25 mm MDF and on the right is the 12 mm MDF.

Therefore, you will need to use thicker wood for the shelves, in order to accommodate the dadoes. This Instructable (not made by me) is particularly good if you want to see how a grid design would be made.\nI made my dadoes 5 mm deep, 12 mm wide (i.e. the thickness of my shelves), and they were cut all of the way across the width of my 'uprights'.\nIn total, I had to put 2 dadoes into 4 pieces of wood. As we hadn't made furniture before, we practised on some scrap wood first to work out where we needed to position the router to get the dado in the correct place.\nWe used our 'practice' piece of scrap wood to guide the router, as it has a straight edge. You can buy a straight edge or a clamp guide to do this bit instead of using a long piece of wood, but whatever you use, just make sure that it is long enough to span the width of the wood piece you're cutting into.\nWe used our practice run calculations (see the whiteboard photo, where the circle is the router and the top rectangle is the scrap wood guide) to place the scrap board into position on the wood piece we wanted to cut, and clamped it in place. In our case, the dado would be positioned 72 mm from wherever we placed the straight edge.\nWe then used the straight edge of the scrap wood to guide the router all of the way across the wood pieces to cut the dadoes.\nFrom the photos you will see that for the the 2 narrowest uprights, we placed them next to each other with the sides lined up perfectly, then cut the dadoes across both pieces at once in order to make the position of the dadoes identical on both pieces. Just make sure the router moves smoothly across this join.\nWe didn't have the space to cut the 2 largest uprights side-by-side, so we instead made a jig (322 mm long) that helped us ensure the scrap wood was the correct distance from the edge when we cut the dadoes into the individual uprights.\nWhat you are aiming for is for the sides of the units to be identical on the inside, so that the shelves won't be wonky and will go in smoothly. Repeat until you have cut all the dadoes.\nNote: Don't cut too fast otherwise the cuts may not be smooth.\nYour shelves should now fit snugly in these dadoes.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1I/JOXA/JTCSP0VY/F1IJOXAJTCSP0VY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUM/VM5P/JTCSP0WF/FUMVM5PJTCSP0WF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVQ/CGU7/JTCSP0WM/FVQCGU7JTCSP0WM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4B/H8LL/JTCSP0WW/F4BH8LLJTCSP0WW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYP/NPSA/JTCSP12H/FYPNPSAJTCSP12H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ4/N1T0/JTCSP12J/FJ4N1T0JTCSP12J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWH/1D4D/JTCSP12L/FWH1D4DJTCSP12L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYL/GGA0/JTCSP12Q/FYLGGA0JTCSP12Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9M/UO9W/JTCSP12U/F9MUO9WJTCSP12U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDK/58ID/JTCSPAR6/FDK58IDJTCSPAR6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTI/398L/JTCSPB17/FTI398LJTCSPB17.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Routing"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "We're going to insert wooden dowels into the base of each unit (one in each corner), that will go up into the upright sides of the units.

This will mean that at the back of this particular unit, the shelves will be recessed (to make room for the backing).\nOne extra step we then did was to add a tiny amount of slightly-watered-down white Polyfilla to the joins at the front of the units - where the shelves meet the uprights - and along the front edges of the shelves and the base.

The reason I didn't use a laser cutter for this stage (like with other projects I've done in the past) is that katalox is too dense to cut on a laser cutter without burning it up.\nWith all the pieces cut out, I took some wood files and filed down the edges of all the cutouts.

As a beginner in the sport, you can go to any retail store that sells archery equipment and buy a dozen low-grade carbon arrow shafts that are pre-fletched. Those arrows will get the job done in terms of developing your form and technique, but they are limited in accuracy because of the straightness of the shaft and fletching. A dozen high-end carbon arrows can range from 100 to 200 dollars depending on the brand and greatly improve your accuracy. With use over time, vanes will begin to peel off, get sliced by broadheads, and become deformed. These accidents have a huge impact on arrow flight and should be fixed immediately. Replacing a perfectly good arrow because of damaged fletching isn\u2019t cost effective.

I use this thing to sand off elephant's foot on 3D-printed parts often.\nAggressive finesse by use of force rather than speed (again, no end grain burning!)\nEnables sanding to be part of the sculpting/shaping process for items like spoons.\n\nOk, now Why the Who:\nThe KitchenAid Mixer is the perfect candidate to drive a slow-speed, high-torque sander. Not only is it the perfect candidate, it's begging to be a shop tool.\nIt's heavy\nIt's crazy powerful with lots of torque\nIt has a variable speed adjuster setting\nIt has a PTO attachment port. (in other words, it's a tractor)\n--\nHistory: Previous Slow Speed Sanders I've Built/Tried/Used\nHere are my previous slow-speed sander builds over the past few years that led up to the Kitchen Aid.\nDrill - handheld: hard to control.\nDrill - clamped in vise: Awkward to clamp, hard to control speed.\nVariable speed right-angle grinder: Actually a decent setup, A bit too fast\nLathe attachment: Still a bit fast (on my lathe) but otherwise very nice.\n30RPM motor: Too slow.\nKitchenAid: For spoon sculpting, the KitchenAid is, IMO, far better than any of my previous setups.\n--\nResources\n7-minute YouTube walkthrough of the design, reason, and build:\nThingiverse for 3D Printed Parts: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3507813\nMy website for additional content outside the scope of this Instructable.\n\nLet's get on with it!\n\nWarning about Sanding Dust:\nUnlike fairy dust, sanding dust is REAL.

A pendent or coin is a good choice.\nNext, you'll need the silicone to cast your metal. While it's possible to use sand or plaster, I find they both have their problems. Plaster contains water and will crack when the water evaporates and sand gives you a very rough surface, and doesn't capture small details. I'll be covering green-sand casting with zinc and copper in a future instructable.\nI'm using mold max 60. It's not cheap, but it gives the best possible result. You can buy it from amazon. https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mold-Resistant-Silicone-R... (uk link)\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Mold-High-Resistant-Silicon...\nNow you need the metal. I get my pewter from old tankards I buy from charity shops. The old battered ones are best because they are the cheapest. You'll be cutting it up and melting down the metal, so the quality doesn't matter. Don't worry if the metal looks dull, it'll look like new once melted down. You can also buy pewter ingots online.\nYou'll also need something to melt the pewter. I'm using a furnace, but that isn't necessary.

First estimate the volume needed. You'll want to mix a little more silicone than needed because there'll probably be losses. Find the ratio of silicone to activator. With mold max 60 it's 100 parts A to 3 parts B by weight. You'll need a gram scale for accurate measurements. I got mine for \u00a313 on amazon.\nPour the amount of silicone you need into a pot. I highly advise wearing gloves when doing this. The silicone gets everywhere and is very difficult to get off your hands. Rubbing alcohol is great for removing it from your countertops. Don't pour the silicone into your nice measuring jug though. Instead, measure it with water, then pour the water into a disposable pot and mark how high the water is. Empty the water and fill the silicone to the line you've just drawn.\nNow weigh the silicone, remembering to take the weight of the pot away from the final measurement. Now you need to add part B; the activator. The silicone will only set once this is added. Assuming the ratio required is 100:3, take the weight of your silicone and divide it by 33.3.\nLet's say you used 150 grams of silicone. You need to add 4.5 grams of activator. Place a second pot on your scales and zero them. Now slowly add the activator (with a pipette if you have one) until the scales read 4.5 grams. Then add the contents to your first pot and still well.\nMake sure the mixture is fully mixed, otherwise the silicone won't set properly. Once that is done, it's time to pour.\nNow, you're meant to use a vacuum pump to get rid of all the bubbles from your silicone before pouring. I Didn't have one. If you happen to have a degasser, use it. Otherwise do what I did.\nPour the silicone slowly from about waist height, with the container with your object on the floor. (Please cover the floor with newspaper first) This will stretch the silicone as it falls, and get rid of any bubbles. Try to pour in one place at the lowest point of your container.\nWhen you're done, leave the silicone to set. Wait at least 20 minutes before touching it. Then put it somewhere safe, and wait 24 hours for it to set properly.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FU1/SWA1/JT91M2HH/FU1SWA1JT91M2HH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Making the Molds."}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "When the molds are set, remove them from your container and carefully remove your object.

They can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6q0fd3ileW...\nYou can just pour the pewter directly into the mold. This works for some objects like the ring I used for this tutorial, but some objects with flat backs get a much better result if you cut a channel in the top of the mold, clamp a sheet of metal to both sides, and pour into the channel.

I'm using English pewter which is supposed to have no lead content, but a respirator should be worn when dealing with any metal fumes.\nI've added a video of the casting process. It's pretty simple, but takes a bit of practice.\nGet the furnace/ blowtorch, stove, whatever else you want to use, heated up, then add the pewter into a heat resistant container. Don't let it get too hot though, or you'll burn the pewter. You're aiming for no higher than 240C.\nWhen the metal has melted, scape off the stuff floating at the top with a metal spoon. This are impurities, called dross or slag. When you see a shiny liquid metal, it's time to pour.\nAct fast, but don't rush. Too slow and the metal will set before you've filled the mold, too fast, and you'll spill the metal everywhere.\nOnce it's cooled down (this happens in minutes with pewter) use pliers to remove the pewter from the mold. Place it in water to make sure it's cool enough to touch.\nDon't expect a good result the first time. There's often a little bit of moisture in the mold which causes air bubbles.

It should only take a few minutes to darken.\nAnother way I accidentally discovered by myself. I was attempting to copper plate some pewter pendants I made. I used a copper acetate bath and ran about 6 volts of electricity through it with the pewter on the negative terminal and a piece of copper on the positive. The actual plating didn't turn out too well. I got a bit of copper on the edges, but that's it. However, it darkened the metal significantly, giving it a weathered look.

We both enjoy a good bottle (or two...) now and then and over the years she's acquired a small collection of wine bottle stoppers as gifts or souvenirs from her travels. While she loved the one that I had made for her, it relegated some of her other stoppers to a kitchen drawer for storage, and before I knew it I was digging through a pile of bottle stoppers every time I needed a pen or pair of scissors. Something had to be done.\nI follow several fantastic woodworkers on youtube, and one of these is Frank Howarth. He is a tremendous designer and is known for his ability to take real-life objects and create a wooden version of them, often using his lathe and CNC (he's made a wooden 8-ball, a football, the Death Star, etc). While kicking around design ideas for bottle stopper storage in my head for a few days, I was watching some of his videos and got inspired to see if I could create a wine bottle out of wood and find a way to mount bottle stoppers on it. Follow me through this Instructable and see how this was done.", "title": "Wooden Wine Bottle Stopper Display", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Wooden-Wine-Bottle-Stopper-Display/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "My intention was to try and remake a bottle of Josh, my girlfriend's favorite wine brand, and was hoping to do so with some scrap woods hanging around the shop. To match colors, I decided to go with walnut for the darkness of the bottle, maple for the lightness of the label, and purpleheart for the boldness of the foil on the top. Since I didn't have thick enough boards, I needed to laminate pieces of all three woods together to get enough thickness.\nI ran them all across the jointer to flatten the sides that I would be glueing together, and then trimmed them down to size on the miter and table saws. With the blanks ready to go, I glued all of the individual wood species together to build them up to thickness. Once dry, I took them to the disc sander to flatten up all of the ends that would then be glued together.\nOne great component of wood turning is that - unlike traditional woodworking and furniture making - since much of the outside of the wood blanks will be turned away in a shower of wood shavings, having to run through the typical jointer/planer/table saw process to mill all of the sides perfectly parallel with 90\u00b0 corners isn't a concern. Since the walnut blank will need to be cut in approximately half (to represent the bottle above and below the label), I squared one corner and cut it down to size.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPX/UELX/JT91OFKP/FPXUELXJT91OFKP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSU/JQTY/JT91ONTG/FSUJQTYJT91ONTG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4P/7FB1/JT91ONTL/F4P7FB1JT91ONTL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHK/B9HH/JT91ONU1/FHKB9HHJT91ONU1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP3/M8KT/JT91ONUI/FP3M8KTJT91ONUI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPU/S804/JT91ONVO/FPUS804JT91ONVO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM9/VY2F/JT91ONY8/FM9VY2FJT91ONY8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPW/WW74/JT91OO2C/FPWWW74JT91OO2C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU0/JQ43/JT91OO2K/FU0JQ43JT91OO2K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2B/MDX7/JT91OO2O/F2BMDX7JT91OO2O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG5/GCBA/JT91OO2W/FG5GCBAJT91OO2W.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Selecting and Milling Lumber"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "With all of the pieces cut down to an approximate size, I need to figure out how to attach all of them together. Since the edges that will be joined together are end grain, a simple glue joint wont be strong enough to inspire much of my confidence when I'll be turning it at thousands of RPMs on the lathe. Now, I'm lucky enough to have a Festool Domino and I use it at nearly every opportunity (to rationalize how much money I spent on the damn thing!), but in this case the process for aligning the mortise locations on pieces that are not the same size simply isn't worth it.\nSo I decided to go with dowels to inject some additional strength into the piece. The easiest way to do this is to create a simple one-use doweling jig to ensure that all of the dowel holes are perfectly spaced on all of the pieces. I cut a piece of plywood to a similar size to the blanks and ensured that one corner was at a perfect 90\u00b0 angle. I put 'X' marks on each edge of this corner on both the top and bottom of the jig, and labeled the two faces 'T' and 'B' for top and bottom. The idea here is that when I'm drilling into the end grain of the blanks, if the face that I'm drilling into is on the top of that particular blank, I orient it so that the 'T' is facing up (or the 'B' is facing up if it's the bottom side of the blank). This ensures that the holes on two joining faces will be perfectly aligned.\nI drilled three holes an inch apart in a triangle pattern that were just ever so slightly undersized relative to the diameter of the dowel plugs that I'm using. The exact placement of these holes is inconsequential, as long as they will not be so far apart that I might end up turning the bottle down too far on the lathe and exposing the dowels within. After figuring out how I wanted the blanks aligned to give me the best grain pattern, I marked the edges with 'X' marks to line up with the dowel jig that I just made. Using the same drill bit, I figured out the depth that I needed to drill (the thickness of the jig plus slightly more than half of the dowel length) and marked that with blue tape on the drill bit. I then drilled the dowel mortises on each face of the blanks, being sure to have the jig properly aligned each time.\nI test-fitted all of the dowel plugs without pushing the blanks all of the way together, as my slightly undersized dowel holes will produce a serious pressure fit that will be hard to take off. Now for the glue up. When doing end grain gluing, I prefer to use long-set epoxy. This penetrates the end grain better and gives a longer working time than traditional wood glue. Here's my process for end grain glue ups: 1) Wet the end grain with water to open the pores of the grain. 2) Spread on a healthy layer of epoxy and allow it to soak into the end grain - this needs to be done several times until the epoxy is no longer being absorbed. You can see in the pictures above how much of this will get absorbed into the pores. 3) When reapplications of the epoxy stop soaking into the end grain, it's ready to be joined together.\nI inserted the dowels into their mortises with epoxy on them, and hammered them together.

First, while all of the corners are intact, I want to mark the center points on each end. I'll start with the bottom end of the bottle blank, drawing lines between opposing corners - the intersection of these lines is the center point. I did the same process for the top piece of purpleheart, but since this piece may be ever-so-slightly offset from the center of the body of the blank, it's important to ensure that the center point on top is in the exact same plane as the one on the bottom. From the centerpoint on the bottom of the blank, I traced two lines on opposing faces all of the way up the sides of the piece until they intersected again at the very top. This point indicates the exact centerpoint of the top of the blank relative to the bottom.\nSince this blank isn't one uniform dimension (as I didn't have enough purpleheart to match the size of the walnut and maple), I want to trim off some of the excess waste wood on the bandsaw to make it a little more balanced on the lathe. This process also allows me to knock back the square corners of the blank, which will save me time and tear-out when I'm roughing the blank into round. To accomplish this, I removed the fence and angled the table of the bandsaw to 45\u00b0, cutting these out by hand.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FE8/FKQL/JT91OOIN/FE8FKQLJT91OOIN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHQ/Q2TR/JT91OOIU/FHQQ2TRJT91OOIU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZG/WGQN/JT91OOKE/FZGWGQNJT91OOKE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ9/UZK9/JT91OOLX/FQ9UZK9JT91OOLX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Lathe Prep"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "As this blank is really just a large (mostly) cylindrical object, I chose to turn this project between centers. The base of the blank is now a strange octagonal shape, so mounting it in the chuck would not be stable, and using a woodworm screw on the base would require me to drill a hole in the bottom which wasn't preferable. So I seated my spur chuck on the bottom end of the blank by hammering it into the centerpoint with a deadblow mallet. After lining up the centerpoint on the top of the blank with the live center, I'm ready to turn.\nAdmittedly, I could have saved myself a little headache by first taking the blank to the drum sander and removing a little more of the outer material to get this blank slightly more round. But I honestly was too interested to see how this was going to turn out that I just mounted it on the lathe and went for it. I'm using carbide insert cutting tools to turn this, as they're incredibly easy to use and require very little of the technique that gouges do, so for instructional purposes I felt it was a good choice. Whenever starting a large new turning with carbide insert tools, I try to ensure that I rotate the inserts to give me a fresh new cutting edge to get the best results possible.\nTurning this blank was slow going at first, as I invested a lot of time in gingerly bringing the blank into round at a slow speed. Since the blank wasn't symmetrical along its width, the balance of the spinning lathe isn't ideal. A great tip for turning an unbalanced piece into round is to start your lathe on a slower speed (around 300-400 RPMs), gradually ramping up the speed until the lathe begins to vibrate and shake slightly, and then dial the speed back just a bit. It takes the guesswork out of deciding on a speed for roughing the blank, and once the piece gets closer to round, you can ramp the speed up a little more.\nI elected to rough this out as if the blank were two separate pieces: the body and the neck. When using carbide inserts to rough a blank into round, it helps to work on small 1\" sections at a time rather than trying to sweep across the length of the piece right at the start. When trying to determine how close to round a blank is, lightly resting the arm of the cutting tool on the top of the blank while it's spinning will indicate where you're at. A round blank will allow the tool to ride along the top smoothly, while one that still has a ways to go will produce a lot of chatter.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0G/TDJB/JT91OOND/F0GTDJBJT91OOND.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9Y/DES9/JT91OOOU/F9YDES9JT91OOOU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVT/TW1Y/JT91OORM/FVTTW1YJT91OORM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Turn Into Round"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Once the blank is fully round, it's time to define the shape. The three most important details to transfer from the actual wine bottle to the blank are the taper of the bottle, the curve of the neck transition, and the length and nub of the very top. Having the glass wine bottle on hand to use as a comparison while turning helps tremendously.\nWhile the taper of the bottom end of the bottle is fairly subtle and easy enough to quickly translate on the blank, the neck transition is a bit trickier. The curve at the top of the body begins earlier than you might think, and the neck shape swoops up before the walnut meets the purpleheart. I switched back and forth between my square radius carbide cutter and round nosed tool, as the former is best for quickly removing material and the latter is ideal for smoothing inside and outside curves. I checked my progress regularly by comparing the glass bottle, and stepped back from the lathe a few times to see how the shape looked from a glance.\nOnce I was happy with the neck profile, I needed to determine where the top end of the bottle will be, and used a parting tool and the round nosed carbide cutter to shape this profile. With the shape of the bottle complete, I pulled out my 100 grit cutting tool (aka sandpaper) and began to sand the entire piece thoroughly. Since I will be doing a good amount of work to the bottle before this project is finished, I only sanded through 100/150/180 grits and will finish the sanding later by hand.\nWith the blank removed from the lathe, the last two main shaping details to consider are removing the small tenon from the bottom of the bottle and cutting off the excess waste wood from the very top. I took the bottle to the bandsaw and carefully cut away the unwanted top of the neck where I marked with my parting tool. The drum sander was perfect for quickly hogging off the small tenon on the bottom of the bottle where I had it mounted on the lathe.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F19/EI1R/JT91ON10/F19EI1RJT91ON10.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3W/NHBT/JT91OOUJ/F3WNHBTJT91OOUJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW3/4A51/JT91OOWT/FW34A51JT91OOWT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX5/W667/JT91OOYO/FX5W667JT91OOYO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYN/B1XV/JT91OP1J/FYNB1XVJT91OP1J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR6/8KF2/JT91OP33/FR68KF2JT91OP33.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Final Turning and Sanding"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "So that actually looks pretty cool! It's definitely a wooden wine bottle at this stage, and I shuddered to think about the next step in this build, which is to drill a dozen holes across the face of the bottle. It was a little tempting just to put finish on the damn thing and place it in the kitchen as an art project, but since necessity is the mother of invention I reconciled myself to press on and drill out the holes to mount the bottle stoppers in...\nThis is one of those points in a project where you tend to step back and say, \"umm, how the hell am I going to do this?\" I need to 1) drill a dozen holes into a cylindrical object, and 2) those holes have to be drilled at an arbitrarily offset angle relative to the face of the object, and 3) they have to securely hold small delicate objects whose body is a cone shape. I really set myself up for success on this one...\nBreaking down those processes individually allowed me to see the best way to proceed. For the first consideration, I need to determine hole placement. For aesthetic purposes, I decided to have four bottle stoppers along each side of the bottle, three stoppers in the middle, and one sitting in the top (as bottle stoppers are prone to doing). Using a combination square, I marked out where the three columns of holes will be and struck lines along the length of the piece. Then I determined the individual placement of these holes - they'll be about 2.5\" apart vertically, and the middle column will be offset so that the holes fall in between the hole placement of the outside columns.\nWith the hole positions in place, it's on to problem number two. I experimented with the idea of using the drill press to drill these angled holes, which would require building a jig to hold the bottle at the correct angle. But after thinking it through, the extreme angle of these holes (about 30\u00b0 relative to the bottle) meant that the chuck of the drill press would get in the way when drilling holes further down the body, so that idea is out. Then I considered building a jig that I could mount to the workbench that would hold the bottle down horizontally and would have a pre-drilled guide hole at the correct angle. But securely holding down a cylindrical object required more engineering than I was interested in doing that particular afternoon, and I was worried that precise repeatably over twelve holes would be a concern. So, I scrapped all of these ideas and decided to drill out the holes by hand. The angles of these don't need to be spot on exact from hole to hole (31\u00b0 in one hole and 28\u00b0 in the next wouldn't be a huge deal), and I wont have to worry about a jig failing halfway through the project and being stuck with another dilemma. All I would need to do is mount the blank in the leg vise of the workbench, and drill away.\nLastly, how do I drill holes to securely hold a cone shaped object? For the hole in the top of the bottle, this is no issue - as long as the diameter of the hole is narrower than the top of the cone of the bottle stopper, the stopper will sit perfectly. But at a 30\u00b0 angle, a simple hole would allow the bottom tip of the stopper to rotate inward and the stopper would end up sitting at 45\u00b0 or more, which would not only look weird but would not hold them securely. After some experimentation on a scrap piece of wood, I decided that each mounting hole would actually contain two holes: one would be large enough that the majority of the bottle stopper base would slide into it, and the other would be small enough that it would hold the bottom tip of the stopper securely in place at the correct angle. I got the best results when using a 3/8\" forstner bit for the primary hole, and finishing off the hole with a 1/4\" forstner for the tip holder.\nWith all of the hurdles now overcome, it was time to drill. I found the best way to drill these was to start drilling perpendicularly to the bottle, slowly pivoting the bit as it gained a grip inside the hole, and leveling out when I hit around that 30\u00b0 that I was shooting for. This results in a tapered-looking hole, and the process was fairly straightforward and thankfully I didn't hit any snags.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FA7/IT2T/JT91OP4J/FA7IT2TJT91OP4J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQN/FH7O/JT91OPCW/FQNFH7OJT91OPCW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCN/D38H/JT91OPEC/FCND38HJT91OPEC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3L/NTSS/JT91OP61/F3LNTSSJT91OP61.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRQ/FFMK/JT91OPA0/FRQFFMKJT91OPA0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F37/UZO4/JT91OPFS/F37UZO4JT91OPFS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9C/7HQ3/JT91OPIK/F9C7HQ3JT91OPIK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN6/SDV9/JT91OPK1/FN6SDV9JT91OPK1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKV/XP5H/JT91OPLN/FKVXP5HJT91OPLN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Drilling Stopper Holes"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "The holes that I just drilled needed some cleanup and TLC to look pretty, so I went at them with a file and some low grit sandpaper. It was important not to change the actual shape of these holes during the cleanup process - rounding over edges or removing material on the inside of the holes will throw off the geometry and the stoppers wont sit properly. These holes don't have to be perfect, but for the ones that will be temporarily empty (until my girlfriend's bottle stopper collection catches up with this project), I want them to at least appear nice at a glance.\nMy plan for this bottle stopper display is to mount it on the wall, so I need to flatten the back face of the piece to allow for that. I decided how much of the back I wanted to remove and used the fence on the bandsaw to line up the blade at the correct spot. After cutting away this wastewood, I hand planed this newly cut face to make it perfectly smooth and flat.\nThere are a number mounting options I considered, but in the end I opted to go with keyhole hangers. These can be easily recessed into the back of the piece, and wont leave much chance for me to mess up the progress I've made so far. The first step here is to strike a line perfectly parallel to the body of the piece and centered on the back face that I flattened. Then, after tracing the outside keyhole hardware, I used a trim router with a plunge base to recess these holes by hand. After determining that the hardware sat flush in these recesses, I needed to remove enough material for a screw head to sit in.\nLastly, for the finish. I sanded the entire outside of the piece both with a random orbit sander and by hand, through grits 180/220/320. I want the finished piece to look glossy and almost like glass, so I opted to go with the glossy version of General Finishes Arm-R-Seal.

I processed all of these blanks at the same time, and it took me maybe 90 minutes from grabbing some blanks off the shelf to putting finish on the turned pieces.\nThe first step is to select your blanks and cut them to size. The ideal dimensions for a small project like this is about 2\" x 2\" x 4\". It's important for the blanks to be square to make it easier and quicker to turn them into round, and you need at least 3-4\" of length to be able to safely mount it on the lathe and have enough material to work with.\nOnce rouged out to dimension, it's time to drill holes to accommodate the stopper hardware. These are available at any of the woodworking specialty stores online for a few dollars, but I picked up a bag of 10 of them a little while ago and can grab one whenever I need an instant gratification project. Since these will be turned between centers, we need to find the center point on each end of the blanks. This is easily accomplished by drawing lines between opposing corners of the end of the blanks - the intersection of these lines is the center point. After finding the correct drill bit that matches the diameter of the mounting hardware, I can square up the blanks in a vise on the drill press and drill a hole on one end that is deep enough to accommodate the tenon or bolt on the end of the stopper hardware.\nTo mount on the lathe, put the hole that was just drilled into the end of the live center, and line up the point on the spur center at the center point of the other end of the blank, tightening down the tail stock. Since these blanks are fairly small and well balanced, cranking up the speed can make turning these a breeze.\nI used carbide insert turning tools on these blanks, and once the corners have been turned down and the piece is round, it's really just the creative process of finding the shape within the blank. First, use calipers to find the diameter of the outer piece of the stopper hardware that will meet up with the wooden handle. The end of the blank that is in the tailstock will be the part of this handle that meets the hardware, so it needs to be turned down to this same diameter. While roughing out a shape to the handle, turn down the waste wood above the top of the handle to a small tenon - this will make it easier to remove the waste wood after the handle is turned.\nWhen you're happy with the shape of the piece, it's time to thoroughly sand. I typically start at around 150 grit and sand up to at least 320. Then the blank can be removed from the lathe, and using a bandsaw or handsaw, the tenon can be cut away to remove the waste wood. Any remaining material on the top of the piece can be easily sanded away, and the top can be sanded smooth up to the same grit as the rest of the handle. Before finishing, wipe the pieces down with mineral spirits to clean up any remaining sanding dust.\nFor finish, it's easy to apply a few coats of lacquer and call it a day. For small pieces like this, use a long necked screwdriver to hold the piece upright while spraying on the lacquer. Some small spring clamps can be used to hold these screwdrivers upright on a work surface while they dry.\nOne the finishing process is complete, use epoxy or CA glue to attach the handles to the stopper hardware. Some hardware kits have a threaded mounting bolt which removes the need for any adhesives. That's it! This is a super quick and fun process and produces a finished piece in no time that can serve as a great handmade gift.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUQ/F0W1/JTENB2QJ/FUQF0W1JTENB2QJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9W/M7FP/JT91OTHC/F9WM7FPJT91OTHC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMS/YPZ5/JT91OTHD/FMSYPZ5JT91OTHD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLR/WH5J/JT91OQLR/FLRWH5JJT91OQLR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA7/B72C/JT91OTHE/FA7B72CJT91OTHE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHE/C4J9/JT91OQSS/FHEC4J9JT91OQSS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBU/DBRB/JT91OQUO/FBUDBRBJT91OQUO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL4/9BEA/JT91OQWY/FL49BEAJT91OQWY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA8/JRQR/JT91OTHF/FA8JRQRJT91OTHF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVI/TWLI/JT91OR1D/FVITWLIJT91OR1D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0F/XYMS/JT91OR45/F0FXYMSJT91OR45.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ1/CYTJ/JT91OR5K/FQ1CYTJJT91OR5K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR0/SEVI/JT91ORAC/FR0SEVIJT91ORAC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEU/JKGP/JT91ORAH/FEUJKGPJT91ORAH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: BONUS: How to Turn a Wine Bottle Stopper"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "In the end, what I can definitively say is that this ended up being a challenging build and a rewarding exercise in design, and produced a very unique piece which serves its intended function.

Conveniently, the 3/4\" plywood was a square. This allowed me to reference the 90 degree angle on 2 sides.\nThen, I used a marker, a ruler, and a combination square to connect the lines.\nAs a side note, I made a few brackets from scrap 1/2\" particle board because I ran out of 3/4\" plywood; however, I didn't use them - yet.

As an engineer I'm always looking at ways to improve things, and my first machine was no exception. The process began with some small changes which quickly turned into the opportunity to overhaul the design even more to better suit my needs (an overview of these changes is detailed in the next step).\nFor the previous iteration and documentation of my design, refer to my original Instructable: Modular DIY CNC Machine which has all the files included for easy access. For this Instructable, however, I've decided to include technical drawings of the plates rather than actual part files. The parts themselves are fairly easy to create so this shouldn't be a large inconvenience for most, especially if you plan on actually using a CNC since CAD is a big step in the whole CNC proces. In the future I'll provide the actual part files for a fee and may consider offering actual printed parts for purchase also for those without a 3D printer.\nWhether you've already made a CNC or this is your first one, I hope you find this Instructable helpful. Feel free to leave any comments or questions down below and if you like what you see please vote for me in the Build a Tool Contest!", "title": "Modular DIY CNC V2", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Modular-DIY-CNC-V2/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "After building my first CNC I realized there were a few things I incorporated that I didn't fully need in the design. Namely:\n1. The size. I originally wanted a CNC that was a decent size and could handle larger jobs, however I found myself only using the front half or so of the machine. This machine has a smaller cut area and I also changed the width and length proportions so wider pieces could be fit on the spoilboard. I did, however, leave the front and back of the machine open to allow for longer pieces to still fit by utilizing a pass through or indexing-like system (similar to one of the Glowforge models).\n2. Rigidity. The original machine had some play in the Z-axis when I mounted a router or spindle and when certain cuts were performed. For this design I chose to incorporate eccentric spacers on all the axis to take away this play and give a tighter grip to the framing.\n3. Materials. The previous machine was made out of 80/20 t-slot framing mainly because 80/20.net would cut the pieces to length and I wouldn't need to use any specialty tools (I essentially had no tools at the time). Through various other projects I've been able to grow my tool collection, and chose to order v-slot extrusions from Openbuilds and cut it to length myself. Additionally, I have a larger 3D printer now so I was able to print all the plates myself and didn't have to get them laser cut elsewhere. Initially I planned to use the 3D plates as prototypes before I ordered laser cut pieces or aluminum plates, however they seem to be holding up so the other options aren't needed.\n4. Electronics. One of my least favorite parts of the previous machine was the electronics bundling. This made it hard to move the machine around, and overall looked fairly messy. For this machine I chose to have a separate box with all the electrical components inside and adapters that can easily be detached if I need to move the machine. The box also has other features included in it that make it easier to use the machine and safer to operate. I also chose to omit limit switches for this design since I didn't use them much, but these can be added back in easily if needed later on.\n--------------------------------------------------\nThe area of travel for the cutting tool (500W spindle) is about 13\" in the X, 9.5\" in the Y and 5\" in the Z, but this could be increased if longer aluminum extrusions were used. The gantry moves along the Y-axis via belt drive with motors on either side of the frame while the X-axis moves perpendicular to the Y-axis along the gantry, also via belt drive. Attached to the X-axis is the Z-axis, which moves up and down via screw drive. I've also incorporated mounting holes on the plates to allow the axes to be converted to screw drive, however this still needs work to mount the motors and make sure everything else lines up.\nThe Z-axis still has a basic attachment scheme, meaning multiple tools can be attached so long as an adapter is designed with matching mounting holes. For my purpose, my 500W air powered spindle can attach and I've created an attachment for my 2.5W laser. You could also design an adapter for a pen or even a 3D printer head to name a few options.\nThe overall cost of this machine ends up being around $325, not including the spindle or laser. I hope you find this Instructable useful if you decide to build your own CNC. There are a lot of resources out there for doing so, and I hope I've created something that helps centralize a small portion of this information.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGS/22VP/JTCSLD22/FGS22VPJTCSLD22.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: The Design"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Frame:\nThe v-slot aluminum extrusions all come from Openbuilds.com but there are other suppliers out there that might be cheaper. The pieces came oversized but can easily be cut with a circular saw. The nature of the design itself allows for various frame configurations so you can adjust the extrusion proportions to fit your specific needs.\nCarriages and Drivetrain:\nThe X and Y axes move using carriages which reduce friction and make it easy for attaching the extrusions, motors, and other electronics. For the carriage plates, I initially was going to use 1/8\" aluminum plates but wanted to make sure I had a plate design that worked first. I started with 1/8\" 3D printed PLA plates and was happy with the fit so ditched the metal plate idea for the time being. Currently I'm using 1/4\" thick PLA plates which add more rigidity than the 1/8\" ones. The carriages also use V-slot wheels with bearings, which start to get costly as you add them up. However, I've found the wheels to work very well, and they increase the overall machine effectiveness. The motors on each carriage then use a belt drive system to move along the frame.\nFor the Z-axis, I added some V rails to the extrusions so the wheels weren't cantilevered as far from the mounting plate. This axis is also driven using a screw and delrin nut directly attached to a NEMA 23 motor which add some rigidity and more power.\nElectronics:\nI already had a lot of the electronics from my previous build so I stuck with what I had to save some money. The CNC is still powered by an Arduino Uno with CNC shield and stepper drivers. Two NEMA 17 motors power the Y axis while one NEMA 17 motor powers the X axis. The Z axis is powered by a NEMA 23 motor. More information on the electronics box can be found in Step 8.\nCustom Parts:\nDrawings for all the plates are attached to this Instructable so you can CAD them yourself. They're pretty simple and can be easily recreated no matter your CAD level. The parts can then be 3D printed, machined out of aluminum, laser cut, etc... Additionally I've tried to design the plates so they can accept either NEMA 17 or NEMA 23 motors, however I have not tested out most of the NEMA 23 motor holes to see if there are any issues. Some plates also have spots for delrin nut blocks to be mounted on if you'd rather use a threaded rod instead of a belt driven system. Again, this has not been fully tested so there may be issues. You'll also need to design a mount to hold the motors if you want to go the threaded rod route.\nNote that all important dimensions should be included in the drawings, however I did not spend the time to clean up the drawings and bring them up to ANSI standards. There should be enough information included to generate the plates regardless though but let me know if any critical dimensions are missing.\n--------------------------------------------------\nMaterials List:\n- Estimated Cost: ~$325 (not including spindle or laser)\n- See attached Excel file for all parts, prices, and links. All plate files are included in drawing format while more complex parts have the .STP file included. Standard disclaimer: Some parts might be missing from assembly materials lists and images. I've attempted to include everything necessary but I might have missed some parts.\n- Note: A lot of the screws listed are meant to work for 1/8\" thick plates. If you're using 1/4\" thick plates you might need to add counterbores or use longer hardware so everything fits correctly. Additionally, all assembly photos show 1/8\" plates instead of the 1/4\" ones I currently have but the assembly is the same regardless..", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFQ/5Z1P/JT91LKYL/FFQ5Z1PJT91LKYL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Bill of Materials"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Tools Needed\nThe tools used are as follows:\n1.

This makes it easier to troubleshoot everything, however this can still be done if the parts have been placed.\nTest the Electronics\nThe general electronics are a duplicate from my previous machine. Like before, make sure to hook up the power supply correctly, otherwise you may short out the components and could destroy your electronics. For an extra precaution, I initially plugged the power supply into a surge protector.\nTo hook up the supply, I took an old computer power adapter and stripped down the cord so the live, negative and ground wires are showing. Make sure whatever cable you use has a ground connection. You can use a multi-meter to determine which wire is which, or you can consult online sources since most cables are the same. Once I determined which wire is which I labeled them so I didn't get them mixed up later on. I then hooked them up and plugged the power supply into the outlet and measured the output voltage using a multi-meter to ensure I was getting the 24V I needed. My power supply had a potentiometer on it so I tuned the supply to get the value I wanted.\nPrepare the Arduino\nThe next step is to load GRBL onto the Arduino Uno as this is what communicates with the motors and transmits the G-Code to the CNC. I placed the motor shield on top of the Arduino Uno and the motor drivers on top of that. It's best to test one motor and motor driver at a time to ensure GRBL is running correctly. Once you've determined GRBL works, you can hook up the rest of the motors and play with them. I thought this step was pretty cool as it's one of the main things that makes a CNC a CNC. There are various programs online to actually send GCode to the Arduino and most of them are pretty light and self explanatory. I like Grbl-Panel the best (linked below), but there are several other programs available that you can find with a quick search. I also attached a few guides I used for installing GRBL and other electronic troubleshooting:\nLoading GRBL\nConnecting GRBL\nUsing GRBL\nCNC Shield First Run\nAt this point you can also use the jumpers included with the CNC kit for configuring the 4th axis and microstepping. Configuring the 4th axis will tell the shield which axis the motor plugged into the \"A\" port on the board controls. For this CNC, place two jumpers across the Y pins (detailed here under 4th Axis Configuration) since the two motors control the Y axis. Microstepping is discussed further in the next step.\nCAUTION: Make sure the power supply is off when messing with the Arduino and CNC Shield. If you don't then you run the risk of damaging the motor drivers, the shield or even the Arduino. Trust me, I learned this the hard way and it's not fun trying to figure out what's causing the problem.\nFinalized Routing\nOnce I had all the electronics working again I routed the cables to the back right of the machine through various drag chains.\nI then laid out the power supplies and other electronics I wanted to hide in the box so I knew what size I should cut my scrap wood into. My box ended up being 8.5\"W x 5.5\"H x 13\"D and has an acrylic window on the top for easy access. I also incorporated holes in one side of the box for the fan, all four motor connections and a spindle connection. Also on this side of the box I added in a 3 way switch that splits a secondary AC current so I can choose if I want to power an outlet or the spindle. I also plan on adding in a relay to the circuit to allow the Arduino to turn on or off the tool whenever the job starts or stops.\nOn the opposite side of the box there are cutouts for the Arduino connections and a spot for the spindle speed control.\nFinally, the back of the box has the power adapter components so I can easily unplug power for the machine itself or the spindle / outlet current.\nIn the initial design I had powered the fan with the Arduino itself but this meant it was only getting around 5V (less than half of what it's rated for). I added in a 24V to 12V converter so I could power the fan straight from the power supply at its full power making it easy to cool down all the components.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FN3/MTO1/JT91PZAF/FN3MTO1JT91PZAF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1M/B31U/JT91PZAI/F1MB31UJT91PZAI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNN/7ZTI/JT91PZAL/FNN7ZTIJT91PZAL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F05/OQ0Y/JT91PZAO/F05OQ0YJT91PZAO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Electronics Routing"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Once everything's been put together your almost done to run your first test program. However, the CNC won't fully have the right settings, meaning your program won't be accurately executed. The CNC must now be calibrated so it actually goes where the Gcode tells it to. For instance, the CNC doesn't know how far one revolution of the motor actually makes the machine move. To configure this, you need to set the step/mm which tell the motors how far they need to rotate to move the amount specified in the Gcode.\nYou may need to iterate through the step values until you have a value that produces the most accurate results. The main formula you need is:\n(New Step Value A) = (Old Step Value) * (Traveled Distance) / (Measured Distance)\nThe best way to find the step value is:\nSet the step value in GRBL\nMark the machine starting location on each axis using tape or a marker\nUse the software to move the machine a specified amount\nCompare the actual amount moved with the desired amount and use the above formula to calculate the new step value. For example, you may tell the machine to move 1\" but it really measures out to be 0.75\" so use the formula to find the new step value.\nRepeat until you have an actual movement value that matches the desired value (i.e. you tell the machine to move 1\" and it actually moves 1\" in that direction)\nYou can also use microstepping which makes the movement smoother at a loss of torque. For this reason, it's best to minimize the overall machine friction in order to have the smoothest movement possible. To incorporate this, you need to connect the appropriate jumpers on the CNC shield and adjust the step value. The new formula you'll need is:\n(New Step Value B) = (New Step Value A) / (Microstepping Fraction) where New Step Value A is still calculated using the formula above.\nFor my machine I used the following settings:\nX-Axis: 24.482 step/mm (Microstep = 1/4)\nY-Axis: 21.122 step/mm (Microstep = 1/4)\nZ-Axis: 49.248 step/mm (Microstep = 1/2)\nI also used the following links for reference:\nStepper Motor Calculations\nCalibrating GRBL\nGBRLInterfacing Programs\nThe following programs can be used to set GRBL settings and send the G-Code:\nGRBL Panel\nCandle\nGCode Sender\n\nIf Your Stepper Motors Aren't Moving\nIf your motors are plugged in but they don't move when you send the commands, make sure the correct current or voltage is being sent to the stepper drivers. You can measure this with a multimeter as mentioned here, then adjust the potentiometer until the correct value is achieved. Your should run the motors per the specifications. If you go over these values you run the risk of damaging the motors or stepper drivers. Also make sure all your electrical connections are sufficient. This can be tedious but sometimes inspecting one component at a time is the best way to find the culprit for your problems.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSM/33D0/JTCSL5LT/FSM33D0JTCSL5LT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWT/PP9M/JTCSL5M3/FWTPP9MJTCSL5M3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Configure the Electronics"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "Now comes the fun part: MAKE STUFF! For this you just need to create a design, make the Gcode, and send this to the machine. There are many different ways to create the code, but I've found success using Easel which is meant for the XCarve, however you can just change the settings to match your machine and export the Gcode. The basic steps for running the machine after generating Gcode is as follows:\nSecure your work piece to the wasteboard.\nMove the machine to the furthest point of your work piece relative to the homed location (machine zero). Lower the Z-Axis so it just touches the work piece.\nZero the machine. Your work coordinates should now be zero (work zero).\nRun the Gcode.\nEasel runs you through these steps so it should be pretty straight forward. I also run the Gcode before having any tools in to avoid damaging the tool if the Gcode isn't quite right, or I just use a scrap piece of material rather than wasting the actual work piece. I quickly tested the machine by laser engraving a square and then doing a test cut using the spindle. Some of the feed settings and depth cuts still need to be optimized but other than that the square came out well.\n--------------------------------------------------\nClamps:\nThere are many different types of clamps out there so it mainly depends on user preference. I like the ones made by Marius Hornberger or you can find ones on Thingiverse too. Alternatively you can also use tape but make sure the workpiece is securely fastened to the wasteboard so it doesn't fly off.\nTips and Tricks:\nIf the motors are skipping steps try adjusting the voltages. The motors may not be getting enough voltage/current.\nRegularly check the belts to make sure they're still tensioned\nIf you use a relay then put M3 at the beginning of your Gcode and M5 at the end to turn the power to the outlet ON or OFF respectively. This is especially useful if you're using a laser so the laser doesn't drag across the workpiece and cause unwanted burn marks.\nIf your machine isn't moving very quickly or movement seems clunky, try adjusting GRBL settings. I found success in changing the acceleration and speed until I got movement I was happy with.\nPossible Improvements:\nUse NEMA 23 motors on all axes for more power\nSwitch from belt drive to threaded rods for more reliability and precision\nUse a knob instead of a coupler on top of the Z-axis to make it more ergonomical\n--------------------------------------------------\nThat's it you're all done creating and setting up your own CNC!

I wanted to use the power button on the battery pack, but I didn't want to try and rewire anything as that's not really my strong suit. So I came up with a button extension of sorts. I needed to make a dowel that had a narrow section on the top and a wider section on the bottom or a stepped dowel.\nIn order to do this I used a brass rod to cut in to a wood dowel which created the stepped dowel. The brass tube has one end that is sharpened, kind of, basically I chucked the brass rod in my drill and tapered the end with a file to thin out the wall and \"sharpen\" the edge. Its not perfect but works well enough for this task. I cleaned up the dowel with a razor blade.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F79/LJ3K/JTCRKNYA/F79LJ3KJTCRKNYA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIA/KQDR/JTCRKNYE/FIAKQDRJTCRKNYE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI4/PKJI/JTCRKNYH/FI4PKJIJTCRKNYH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAJ/X3CO/JTCRKNYZ/FAJX3COJTCRKNYZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6R/UM9Z/JTCRKNZ4/F6RUM9ZJTCRKNZ4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10:"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "I did a dry fit with all the pieces.

You can see in the last pic the small wooden button.\nSo this works because the actual power button has a bit of a springiness to it, it has a nice click to it.

It's very easy to fall into the trap of 'designing as you go' but this does make the implementation much longer and can be risky should you come up against any unforeseen issues that a robust design would identify.\nThere's no reason why you can't hand draw your design with a pen and paper, but I prefer using a 3D modelling software like Sketchup. This allows you to draw everything to the exact scale, and also take measurements off the model once it has been drawn.\nIf you're new to using Sketchup I would recommend spending some time working through their free YouTube tutorials I found it easy to use and picked it up quite quickly.\nTo start drawing your area in Sketchup measure everything you can and put this into your model. I started by doing a few hand drawn sketches of the area then marking the drawing up after crawling around the space with a tape measure.\nOnce the space is modeled you can then start on the design of your drawers. You can then transfer each section onto a cutting plan that will help you to estimate how much materials you will need, and how to cut the sheets of wood for minimal waste.\nThe Sketchup file for this set of draws can be downloaded in this step.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FY8/JYYB/JT91OIZL/FY8JYYBJT91OIZL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F73/N4LS/JT91OIYI/F73N4LSJT91OIYI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Measuring Your Space and Designing in 3D."}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Note: If the wall under the stairs is made of brick rather than plasterboard (drywall) in my case, you may want to start demolition of the wall in the next step first.\nThe frame that holds the drawer runners is made out of 4\"x2\" timber. Cut a housing (dado) into the upright pieces that would support the horizontal supports at each end and screw these uprights into a piece of 4\"x2\" that will fix to the floor. It is important that the horizontal supports are supported from the top and the bottom with the housing (dado) to prevent them coming away with a see-saw action when a heavy drawer is fully extended.\nOnce you have the uprights installed at the front and back you can install the horizontal cross members the the drawer runners will fix to. Before fixing down it is important to spend the time to ensure all your horizontal pieces are square, level, and all parallel with each other. This will ensure the drawer runners are parallel when fully extended.\nWhen fixing everything down it's best to fix in as many places as possible to make this as rigid as possible. This frame is going to take the weigh of the drawers so it is not ideal if there is any room for movement or vibration. In my case I used a lot of metal \"L\" brackets to support this frame from all angles. This was mainly because my walls and floor were not square and these brackets allowed a square frame to be fixed to a wonky wall.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSC/A142/JT91QU2H/FSCA142JT91QU2H.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Making the Frame"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Bravery test!

Don't worry too much about the rough edge, this will be covered with your PVC angle later in the project.\nYou could also use a jig saw here. I opted for the hand saw as I felt it would make less mess and would be easier to control.

If your drawer runners are not level and parallel your drawers could be stiff and difficult to open and close.\nOffer your first run up to the first horizontal support and use a clamp to hold in place. The clamp needs to be firm enough to hold it and allow some wiggle room to make adjustments. Use a spirit level to make sure this is as level as possible. Once level screw it in place.\nWhen installing the 2nd runner in the pair, follow the same process by clamping in place, but this time you will need to ensure it is not only level but at the same height as the first level. Use a spirit level across the two runners to make sure they are at the same height. Once in position it can be screwed in place.\nNow that both runners are screwed in place it is worth fully extending the runners and checking that they are not only level with each other, but that they are parallel. You can do this by measuring the distance between them at the front and back to ensure the distance is the same. You can then go one step further by measuring diagonally from the front of one runner the back of the next, and making sure this is the same for both sides.\nIn one case I had runners that were not parallel so I used some penny washers to pack out the back of one set of runners to bring them parallel with the 2nd in the pair.\nIt is possible to now leave these and move onto building the drawers, however I went one step further and mounted a strip of 1\"x2\" timber onto each drawer runner, and installed a cross piece between them, so that I had a sliding solid base that the drawers can sit on and fix to.

Up to 15 cuts for free and a small fee for additional cuts providing they are all straight line cuts and not on pieces too small. I found all the cuts on the large sheets were accurate to the exact measurement I gave. I only used this service to cut down the large sheets so they were small enough for me to get them home.\nTIP: If you model each piece you need to cut out in the Sketchup model, you can get the most pieces out of your sheet of wood with the least waste.\nI used a table saw to cut each piece out. You can also use a hand circular saw with a straight edge if you don't have a table saw, or you could try your hand at cutting with a hand saw if you're brave enough to cut a straight line.\nTo find the angle of the stairs, I used an angle finder which I transferred over to the table saw sled.\nTIP: If using a circular saw or table saw with plywood, you're likely to get some splintering on your cuts. To overcome this you can make the cut in 2 passes. The first pass with the saw at half the dept of the wood, and the second finish off the cut.

These are the pieces which you will see the screw head in. Next, using a drill bit slightly smaller than the thread of the screw, align your two pieces and mark the receiving piece with your smaller dill bit.\nOnce you have all your holes marked out, drill a pilot hole deep enough to take the entire shaft of the screw. As plywood is multiple pieces of wood sheets glued together, if you are to screw into the end grain without a pilot hole you will force the single sheets apart and your plywood will split. A decent pilot hole will prevent this from happening.\nLastly, make sure you are using a screw that is partially threaded. That is a thread for most of the shaft but a smooth section of the shaft by the head of the screw that will not bite into the top piece of wood. This will allow the pieces to be pulled together when you screw them up tight.\nI started by fixing the bottom and two sides of the drawers together first.

You could now just screw down from the top into the timber bases, however you will see the screw heads on your drawer surface so a cleaner look will be to screw up from the bottom.\nTo do this, use wood clamps to hold the drawer to the base so that both drawer and base will stay attached to each other and you can use the release mechanisms on the drawer runners to remove both parts from the frame under the stairs.\nOnce removed you can drill a pilot hole from the bottom and screw into place.\nTIP: If screwing in from the bottom, make sure you check the length of the screw isn't going to piece through to the top side of the bottom shelf on the drawer.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FA2/NWUN/JT91QTVR/FA2NWUNJT91QTVR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYV/LB80/JT91OIL0/FYVLB80JT91OIL0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRL/B9JG/JT91QTUN/FRLB9JGJT91QTUN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFA/OEG3/JT91QTU9/FFAOEG3JT91QTU9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Fixing the Drawer Units Into Place"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "The front panels are the decorative fronts that you will see when the drawers are closed. I used a thinner sheet of MDF for my drawers. I chose MDF as it has a smooth finish and I wouldn't have to do too much to prep it to make it look like its part of a hidden drawer.\nI checked the measurements twice for this piece, and allowed for a 5mm gap around each drawer front. Rather than cutting each drawer front individually, I cut a piece to fit in the the space where the wall was and then cut down into drawer sections last. This meant I would have accurate edges that would align perfectly.\nI cut the sheet down on the table saw so that the bottom and sides were the right size. The sheet was too large to cut the angle of the table saw sled, so I used a circular saw and a straight edge to cut the angled edge.\nTIP: Cutting MDF with power tools can usually cause burning on the edges. I find that making the cutting blade as shallow as possible reduces the amount of burning on the edges.\nOnce the sheet is the right size it can be cut into the pieces to cover the front of the drawers. At this point it's worth checking it fits and checking where each drawer starts and finishes to make sure you're cutting in the right place.\nUsing the longer edge against the rip fence, cut this piece down on the table saw.\nLastly, using a chamfer bit in a router will give the edges a clean edge that will be less likely to suffer damage from minor bumps from everyday use.\nTo fix the front panel to the drawer, first wedge the drawer forward so that the drawer is sticking out and you have a solid edge to push against. Use a small amount of hot glue on the MDF front panel and stick it to the drawer that is sticking out. If your hot glue gun is set to a hot temperature you will have 10-20 seconds working time before it dried solid. Use this time to align the front panels so that they fit in place perfectly.\nOnce the front panels are held in place you can drive a series of small screws in through the drawer front to the front panel to hold firmly in place.\nTIP: Once again, drilling a pilot hole in the MDF will help the screw catch and not rip out the MDF.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVL/923X/JT91QTTL/FVL923XJT91QTTL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP0/NBG3/JT91OIQI/FP0NBG3JT91OIQI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL5/NWUA/JT91QTT5/FL5NWUAJT91QTT5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOE/82UW/JT91OIVD/FOE82UWJT91OIVD.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Making the Front Panels"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "There are a variety of push to latches available.

THIS is why everything takes so much longer than it should!\nSoooo.... yeah...The tool works, but even after removing all the clearance in the holes and slots there's still just a bit of tolerance I can't seem to get rid of with the sliding design. And... I made the mistake of borrowing a professional version of this tool from a friend to see how it works. So this \"tolerance stackup\" is enough to annoy me now that I know the \"real\" version works better. Wiferneer also ran across a metal commercial sliding style divider tool at a sewing expo about this time and we saw the same tolerance stackup with the commercial version that is in our homebrew version.\nSigh. Back to the drawing board...\nThe tool I borrowed works well. There isn't noticeable or measurable (with a tape measure) slack. The main difference I see is that it uses a pivioting motion on the pointer legs instead of a sliding motion.\nWith this observation, I changed directions from a sliding style divider tool to a pivoting style divider tool. This doesn't look as neat, isn't as fun to use, isn't as clean to mark intervals since the tip is canted - but it removed a little more tolerance and it reduced the number of parts to assemble so we'll call it a win.\nAttached to this step is the re-remix V8, a pivoting style equal distance divider tool.\nThis is the one I'm personally using in my shop.\nAssembly of V8 is easier than V7, there's only two layers to stack and that means there's also only one size of chicago screw needed. Basically criss-cross a pointer leg and a connector leg to assemble. Insert a chicago screw and then Loctite the screws when you're done. I forgot to take pictures during the assembly so unfortunately we'll have to use the picture of the tool expanded for the assembly reference.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FW6/U31R/JSL3BEJI/FW6U31RJSL3BEJI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9S/153G/JTEN33Q6/F9S153GJTEN33Q6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB0/F0B5/JSL3BCWN/FB0F0B5JSL3BCWN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F23/T2XW/JT91VTQL/F23T2XWJT91VTQL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFL/K9AZ/JSL3BD18/FFLK9AZJSL3BD18.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWJ/XZHG/JSL3B147/FWJXZHGJSL3B147.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Redirect, Remix the Remix"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "It works!\nOK, I know you have questions, so here's some questions I asked myself while working on this re-mix.\n1) Self - Why can't the tip of the divider just be a normal triangle? Answer - Dear Self, The tip has a straight edge so you can draw a straight line to mark on your workpiece. Duh...\n1a) In the pivoting version this is less of a thing since the tips angle sideways instead of slide up and down.\n2) (OK, I can't do third person anymore...) Why are there scallops on the divider leg of the sliding version but not on the other legs? Answer - The chicago screws need to be able to nest into this piece in order to fully collapse the tool. Checkout the picture.\n3) Do you think this will be as accurate as the commercial versions? Answer - Probably not. This version is made of wood and there has to be some \"tolerance\" to allow the screws to rotate. However, I'd bet it's just as accurate as using a tape measure to do the same layout job and it's faster.\n4) You list polyurethane in the materials section, but this tool doesn't look finished? What gives? Answer - I need to stop using it for a couple days so I can take it apart and put a coat of poly on it to make it last longer!\n5) Why is the metal version so much taller?

Traditional mortise/tenon, pocket screws, or dowel joinery could also work for this build.\nFor the stopped dovetails, a one time use jig was created. This allowed me to be able to accurately locate the sliding dovetails on both the front and back rail to ensure that the riser pieces to raise the top were located exactly opposite of each other. The sliding dovetails were cut using a dovetail bit in the router, a collet, and the one time use jig.

I then cut a 45 degree angle at the top of the pieces. I started the cut about an inch from the back of the board.\nThen I cut the back of the organizer. The back piece was 14.5\u201d by 15\u201d. I wanted the full width to be 16\u201d. When the first three pieces were cut I moved on to cutting the slots for the dividers.\nOf course we know that wrenches come in all sorts of shapes and sizes so the so the size of the slots in my pliers organizer can be different as well. I made my slots between 1\u201d and 1.5\u201d. Most regular pliers will fit in an one inch slot but some do call for a little more room. I used my sliding miter saw to cut shallow channels an inch apart. I find that two passes of my saw blade makes a channel wide enough for a 1/4\u201d piece of ply. I cut all my channels and then checked to make sure the plywood would slide into each one. If there was one that was too tight, I went back to the saw and went over it one more time.

Assemble! I used TotalBoat 2:1 mix high performance epoxy resin for this because it cures clear and is super workable. Now let's talk about epoxy resin for a bit. It's formulated to be used in thin layers because it's an exothermic reaction which builds up heat (max of about 1/2\"). If you pour it too thick, it will overheat and boil, crack, and/or possibly split up your marriage. So why am I using epoxy for such a large resin casting? Almost entirely just because I was told that it wouldn't work. Spite is kind of on-brand for me I guess.\nI start with the bottom section of the screwdriver, the blue section. Now I need to do this in multiple pours to build up the layers, so I need to ensure that the color is identical with each layer or you will be able to seeing the layers super easily. The way that I solved this problem is by mixing the blue dye in with the resin part of the mix and then combine with hardener just the amount I need for each layer. That way, the remaining blue resin is the same color and won't cure since I haven't mixed it all with hardener yet.\nI mix enough volume to be roughly equivalent to a 1/2\" layer around the outside of the form. This mix gets put in my vacuum chamber to pull out all of the bubbles. Luckily, I use a slow cure hardener which gives me about 40 minutes of working time. The bubbles take about 30 minutes to pull out, which gives me just enough time to pour it into the form.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3A/13OF/JT91JL51/F3A13OFJT91JL51.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRX/QM4E/JT91JL72/FRXQM4EJT91JL72.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFZ/0VM1/JT91JLAF/FFZ0VM1JT91JLAF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: Preparing the Epoxy"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "After my 30 minute timer goes off, I pour the epoxy into my silicone form. The top is closed up with some plexiglass just because I'm curious to see what's going on inside. I also use a piece of scrap wood to span corner to corner so that I can use the tailstock on the lathe to support the box on the lathe.\nNow is where this project fails or succeeds... I slowly turn up the speed of the lathe so that the epoxy will spread out and turn it up to 600 rpm to get it going fast enough that the epoxy is pushed to the outside of the form (which you can actually see here!). Now let's back up a second, why am I doing this? Main reason is because if I just poured 1/2\" layers directly in the bottom of the form and built it up from there, there would be subtle layer lines on the screwdriver. Doing it like this, the layer lines are on the end and almost invisible. This also had the side benefit of letting me pour essentially twice as much because I get a 1/2\" layer all the way around which is equivalent to 1\" in thickness. Going into this I actually talked to the TotalBoat technical reps because neither of us were actually sure if this technique would work because the epoxy might react funny to rotating once it hits the gel stage in the curing process. I figured if I got it rotating fast enough, gravity should be negligible compared to the force pushing out on the form so I decided to give it a shot.\nSuccess!! This is after a few pours already. I leave the form spinning on the lathe for an hour before I pour in the next layer. I was just guessing on this set time, but after it looked good on the first layer I just stuck to it. You want to make sure that you are pouring the next layer while the previous layer is still in the gel stage to ensure that they will bond together. This actually worked out nicely because I just set a timer to go off every 30 minutes and I would mix up a batch of epoxy and then put it in the pressure pot after 30 and then after that has been spinning for 30 I would mix up the next batch to have it ready after the previous pour has been on the lathe for an hour.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOB/3Q7E/JT91JLDQ/FOB3Q7EJT91JLDQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F09/6DAW/JT91JLJ5/F096DAWJT91JLJ5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZD/EF36/JT91JLVZ/FZDEF36JT91JLVZ.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif"], "step_title": "Step 11: Epoxy Pouring Adventure"}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "Rinse and repeat the same process for the clear part of the handle (except with no dye this time) and then once the whole piece is cured, I can pop it out of the form.

I put that aside and made a new casting, I figure I'll turn the dud into one of those Craftsman screwdriver handled bottle openers instead. Not for giant bottles though, because the metal bit will be the same size as the regular one... I just like the idea of that visual.\nThe ends of the epoxy castings that were the top of the form are a little lumpy just because that's where I poured it in, so I flatten both of them on the disk sander.

Not the worst thing in the world because that profile is already defined by where the clear epoxy that I poured to join the pieces meets the blue epoxy of the bottom section.

This is the easiest way I've found on larger circles where typical jigs won't fit anymore (plus the outside is slightly irregular still at this point).\nIf you don't account for the mess that this left behind after, this was a really fun part of the process. The shank is bit is going to be 1\" bar stock, so I just pick the forstner bit that is slightly larger than the diagonal of that piece and go to town drilling. You just need to make sure not to push it because you can overheat the epoxy. I'm realizing now that I should have just left the center of this part hollow, but wasn't it worth the confetti show? Probably not, my apologies. So I'm not long enough, no surprise there. If you look at the regular screwdriver, the bit actually extends a bit into the clear part of the handle a decent amount.

The holes were drilled with a forstner bit, but the EMT was undersized, so I had to pad it out with electrical tape in order to get a snug fit.\n\nThe Achilles heel was mounting the 2x4s on their face, as opposed to their edge. I didn't want to waste 3 1/2\" of the already shallow 11\" space behind the door, so I gave it a shot. 1 1/2\" of attachment between the wood and pipe just isn't enough, so they ended up sagging unevenly.\n\nWhen the time came to upgrade, I looked at the common metal lumber rack kits, but most have 5-6 horizontal supports, which are fixed. I wanted adjustability for tighter spacing, so I wasn't always burying the board I wanted under 37 others.\n\nMy solution was metal track shelving components from the home center. I bought two 72\" lengths of track and cut them each in half to fit my space. The brackets are sold individually and are available in a few different depths (6.75\", 9.53\", 11.75\", 14.86\", 18.96\"). I went with 11.75\" since that's what fit my available space and I started with 12 brackets. If/when I want to add more shelves, it's just a quick trip to the store.\n\nI started with four equally spaced shelves, but I'm able to adjust them and add/remove as necessary depending on current wood inventory.

May I suggest ... sacrificial OSB wall panels.\n\nI have two floor to ceiling wall panels and one partial panel. The panel by the table saw is built like a standard wall because a 2\" PVC pipe runs through it and it's held against the wall with two blocks screwed into the joists. The other panels have the 2x4 framing laying on face, keeping them tighter to the wall to conserve space. (1 1/2\" as opposed to 3 1/2\"). The wall behind the drum sander is tied into a corner post of the house and a pipe chase, while the partial wall is secured to a rim joist.\n\nI skin my panels with 1/2\" OSB primarily because it's less expensive and lighter than plywood, but I've found that it holds screws just as well.

It seems like such a simple and elegant solution - just attach some parallel strips to the wall, which have a 45 degree angle cut on the top. Then make tool hangers with the complimentary angle cut and you are off to the races.\n\nFor me, this was a false sense of adjustability and flexibility. I thought I'd be able move tools around as acquired and keep things tightly nested, but in actuality, I ended up with wasted space due to tool lengths causing collisions.\n\nA slightly better option would be slot wall. Less wasted space, but still the need to make custom holders that integrate with your chosen slot wall (not standard) for each new tool acquisition.\n\nThe method which is working for me is just securing things directly to the wall. This allows me to position items exactly where I want them to make use of all available space. Tool holders are screwed to the wall, combination squares hang on a magnetic strip, and for pegs, I use modified drywall screws [see next step].\n\nI didn't entirely eliminate the use a french cleats. My chisel storage rack [Fig. 6] and saw blade cabinet have integrated cleats (glued and nailed in place), so I just screwed a necessary length of cleat to the wall. I also have one row of cleat above my sanding area, which I use to hang strap clamps and drum shells during work [Fig. 7]\n\nI've also repurposed a few office organizers.

I'm hyper-organized. I like clutter free spaces, dedicated storage, economy of motion, efficiency, and enjoying myself in the workshop. The last thing I want to do is dig through piles of junk looking for tools and materials.\n\nStep one to eliminating clutter ... give everything a home. Most of us employ this practice daily in a room we call \"the kitchen.\" Aside from a few lunatics (Kevin), it's safe to say that everyone has system when it comes to the kitchen. Dishware in this cabinet, glasses in this cabinet, canned goods over here, spices over there, etc. It's really easy to use that same approach in a workshop.\n\nWhen you have dedicated storage for tools, materials, and supplies, you're more likely to put them away, which means you'll know where to find them in the future. When your pancakes are burning on side one, I bet you know exactly were to find the spatula and have it in hand within seconds. You aren't running around the room looking in every cabinet while the delectable treats burn to an inedible crisp. You shouldn't have to frantically search for a clamp, marking gauge, or a damp rag during a glue up, nor should you be searching for screws or other materials mid project when you are in the creative zone.\nPertinent examples:\nI keep commonly used 1lbs boxed screws in a shop made storage rack [Fig. 1]\nSmall hardware (nuts, bolts, washers, etc) are in Harbor Freight storage cases [Fig. 2]\nDrum hardware (lugs, bolts, washers, vents, etc) live in Gladiator storage bins [Fig. 3].\nI'll take it a step further by renouncing the use of tool cases/bags. Back in the day, tools came in plastic cases for storage and transport, which is nice if you move job sites all the time, but in a stationary workshop, they become a hindrance. They are rarely a uniform size and even if you do manage to stack them, the next tool you need will be on the bottom. The bags are even worse because they are oddly shaped and deform when you look at them. It only took me a few weeks of pulling tools in and out of cases before I decided they were a waste of time and space. Now most of my tools have their home in plain sight, so it's just grab and go.\nPertinent examples:\nBulky and/or rarely used tools are stored on a shelf under the miter station - circular saws, corded angle grinder, finish nailer, and jigsaw [Fig. 4].\nThe Festool Domino in it's case since it has multiple accessories and is actually a useful container.\nMy drills and impact drivers have integrated belt clips, which I use to hang them on the tool wall instead of building a larger storage caddy [Fig. 4].\nMy drills and impact drivers have integrated belt clips, which I use to hang them on the tool wall instead of building a larger storage caddy [Fig. 5].\nOther handheld power tools are hung on the tool wall using the sprinkler pipe pegs - brad nailer, pin nailer, cordless grinder, glue gun [Fig. 6].\nAlso, drawers are evil. If you want to misplace and eventually forget something even exists ... put it in a drawer. I used to have a drawer under my router table for the wrenches, bits, a depth gauge, and some calipers. It never failed that the item I wanted was buried at the bottom. The only set of drawers that still resides in the shop is a short filing cabinet, which is primarily used as the stand for my OSS.\nPertinent examples:\nInfrequently used router accessories are kept in the affore mentioned filing cabinet drawers - bases, edge guides, table pins, older bits [Fig. 7].\nRouter wrenches are stored by their router in plain site by using neodymium magnets [Fig. 8 & 9].", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FI6/BBN2/JT4TPCYZ/FI6BBN2JT4TPCYZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRS/8C77/JT4TPCZB/FRS8C77JT4TPCZB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSG/UFHM/JT4TPCZO/FSGUFHMJT4TPCZO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0K/PI7M/JT4TPCSQ/F0KPI7MJT4TPCSQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFU/WLAH/JT4TPCST/FFUWLAHJT4TPCST.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6F/QNWR/JT4TPCTH/F6FQNWRJT4TPCTH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEX/ULY0/JSYZBU8U/FEXULY0JSYZBU8U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRI/CLHX/JT4TPCTV/FRICLHXJT4TPCTV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ6/135Z/JT4TPCTU/FZ6135ZJT4TPCTU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Every Tool Needs a Home ... and Not in a Drawer"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "My small space dictates where most of the stationary tools are placed, but I still put some thought into it.\nPertinent examples:\nThe table saw is near the door with ample open space on the infeed side. It abuts the workbench/assembly table, which therefore functions as the outfeed table.\nThe jointer is directly under the lumber rack - tucked behind the door in an otherwise unusable space.\nThe miter saw is against a long wall with space on both sides for long stock and has direct/open access from the door.\nThe bandsaw is nested against the assembly table. Because they differ in height, there are no obstacles on the outfeed side.\nOnce placement was established for these large tools, I filled in the voids with the remaining tools. Is a corner the best placement for a drill press? Not really, but when the need to drill longer stock arises, I just pull it out from the wall. I'd also prefer to have my drum sander next to the rest of the sanding tools, but it doesn't fit. It's tucked in an opposite corner, which works for most of the projects I make. When I'm fabricating trim molding for the house and need space for long stock, I just roll it into the space in front of the table saw.\nSmall Shop Tip: Put everything on wheels. Even if you don't plan on moving tools, invest in the future. You'll be able to easily rearrange, reposition tools for large material, and even move tools for deep cleaning.\n\nI'm of the opinion that tool grouping is more important than overall layout. In the kitchen, the oven/stove is the stationary tool. It stands to reason that most of us store pots and pans within close proximity and they are all stored together - not spread out like an easter egg hunt. I make it a point to store all similar tools and their accessories in one spot.\nPertinent examples:\nIn a back corner of the shop, I have my sanding zone. The two stationary tools are the oscillating belt/spindle sander and a downdraft table. Every other sander also lives in that zone. 1\" strip sander on the tabletop, orbital sander hangs on the wall, belt sander and detail sander sit on shelf under the table [Fig. 2]\nNote: The drum sander is an exception due to space limitations.\nAll drill bits are stored on a rack next to the drill press [Fig. 3].\nBandsaw blades are hung next to the saw [Fig.4]\nPush sticks, insert plates, and brake cartridges are stored by the table saw.\nRouter bits, wrenches, and router lift tools are all stored on or next to the router table.\n\nTo further demonstrate my extreme organizational practices, I store all pertinent sleds and jigs next to their related tool. They all have a permanent storage location and if they aren't within direct reach, they are no more than a few steps away.\nPertinent examples:\nAll marking gauges and small handheld tools are stored on the tool wall adjacent to the assembly table.\nDrilling jigs are stored on the wall panel behind the drill press [Fig. 3].\nA small bandsaw sled sits on the PVC dust collection run by the saw [Fig. 4].\nAn ever growing collection of sleds are stored on the wall panel adjacent to the table saw [Fig. 5].\nCustom jigs for drum making are stored on a wall, which is just a few steps from the tablesaw and workbench/assembly table [Fig. 6].\nJig Tip: Label your jigs with their purpose, as well as any specific use information. Take my 6 Pack Groove-In-Ator 1.0 jig as an example [Fig. 7]. If I hadn't labeled it, I wouldn't remember it's function. If it weren't for the fact that I recorded it's birth date, I wouldn't remember when I made it. Luckily for me, past BALES denoted the required router bit and base (thanks, buddy). He even marked a center line, so the jig can be quickly aligned to the work piece.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPF/LNM4/JSYZBV4C/FPFLNM4JSYZBV4C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F38/8JNH/JSYZBV44/F388JNHJSYZBV44.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUO/28SC/JSYZBV37/FUO28SCJSYZBV37.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJZ/G5OE/JSYZBV38/FJZG5OEJSYZBV38.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD5/M8EW/JSYZC4X7/FD5M8EWJSYZC4X7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6O/HWQ0/JSYZBU8N/F6OHWQ0JSYZBU8N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUX/OJKL/JT4TPD0G/FUXOJKLJT4TPD0G.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Tool Placement and Accessory Symbiosis"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "This one goes against my tool grouping ideology, but hear me out.\n\nI've seen large clamp racks on walls, as well as clamp racks on casters that you can ride around the shop like a scooter, but I don't have the need, nor the space (for the clamp rack ... I'll totally take the scooter).\n\nI think I started with 4 clamps and just stored them towards the top of my tool wall. As the projects grew, the collection grew, but space on the wall diminished. It also became painfully obvious that I always needed a clamp when they were all out of reach, so I started spreading some around the shop.\n\nI have found that for my workflow, large bar clamps, K body clamps, and F-clamps, can be stored in a solitary location.

I made one horizontal run along two walls of the shop using 2\" pipe. The solitary turn is accomplished with a sweeping 45 degree fitting and wye fittings are used for the tool drops. 2\" flexible couplers/boots connect the PVC to aluminum blast gates and then 2 1/2\" flex hose ties into each tool.\nNote: Some people insist that PVC needs to be grounded. I've seen several methods using copper wire - some inside the pipe and others on the outside of the pipe. My system is not grounded. I've never experienced static build up, never been shocked, and nothing has blown up.\n\nThis set up is surprisingly effective. It kept up with all of my stationary tools until I upgraded from a job site saw to a professional cabinet saw. It's also no match for handheld routing. Space is still a concern for me, so I'm considering a dedicated wall mounted dust collector for the table saw.\n\nFor overall air quality, I use a Jet air filtration system [Model AFS-1000B], which is centrally mounted above my work bench. I was shocked at how much of a difference it actually makes, so I highly recommend it as an addition to any workshop. Several companies make them at this point (Grizzly, Shop Fox, Rikon, Powertec), so the cost has dropped to around $200. WEN has a unit around $150.\n\nMy manual collection system is a dual attack - buckets and a brush. The buckets are for off cuts and prior to using them, I'd just toss pieces onto the floor, which I would then have to pick up later. Buckets keep the floor clean, probably reduce accidents, and are easy to empty into the fire pit once full. I have one next to the bandsaw/miter saw zone and one next to the table saw. The brush comes in handy for cleaning the dust off of the workbench and table saw mid project.\n\nBottom line IMO: Some dust collection is always better than no dust collection.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FV0/VBLK/JSYZBV3X/FV0VBLKJSYZBV3X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF9/UPE8/JSYZBV3Y/FF9UPE8JSYZBV3Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVQ/WVV4/JSYZBV40/FVQWVV4JSYZBV40.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB5/891X/JSYZBV3Z/FB5891XJSYZBV3Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDD/QZZJ/JSYZBV31/FDDQZZJJSYZBV31.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8A/69XX/JSYZBV35/F8A69XXJSYZBV35.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYJ/2DBS/JSYZBV41/FYJ2DBSJSYZBV41.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Dust Collection"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "I'm in the habit of putting on safety glasses and ear protection when I enter the shop and leaving them on until I quit for the day, but it was a struggle in the beginning.

The cord is also a safety hazard unless you run it under your shirt.

It is based on simple hexagonal geometry and it's triangular division. The angles of the triangle in a hexagon gives proper support to the books lying on them. I chose cardboard because of it's strength due to corrugation. It is potentially a good material to explore and work with.\nI like to work with a combination of geometry, physics and materials. It is an amazing combo if explored to it's fullest.

The micro car is mainly remote controlled but it has ultrasonic obstacle sensor inputs and capability to make decisions upon those inputs therefore is able to sort of steer and drive itself.\nDuring the production of this 30cm micro car, the time required for printing was so long and processing parts was so boring and difficult i realized that 3d printing a 1.5 long car would be almost impossible for me with the capabilities at hand such as my small Anet a8 3d printer and the makeshift workshop which i currently have access to.

Based on my sausage fingers I added enough space around the outside to allow me to grab them and also slip them into the cabinets easily but you can adjust those measurements according to your bins. I have seen other examples of this type of storage made for the harbor freight containers and that works just as well.\nOnce you figure out the inside dimensions everything else is designed around those numbers. For my bench I could fit four stacks of bins so I made two of these double-stack boxes and one extra at the end that was not wide enough to hold the bins. The boards you use can be anything - plywood works great and here I used some leftover scrap from some unfinished furniture. Make some standoffs to hold the bins as well, a lot of them. I had a bunch of 1/2\" ply and ripped it to 1-1/2\" wide and eased off the inside corner before sanding them a bit. I made 8 smaller ones at 1-1/8\" wide for the bottoms that don't get put into a slot.\nI cut some rabbets around the back edges so I could use 1/4\" plywood for the backer board. You could also be lazy and just pin the back on but I had the blade on already so why not get fancy. Then with the dado blade set to the same width as 1/2\" plywood cut the dados across the boards at 3/8\" deep to hold the standoffs. When measuring from the bottom you don't cut a slot for the first one because the edge of the board is too close. Instead you just lay a standoff in the corner after everything is together. But you have to allow for the skipped one when you measure up - basically you want 3/4\" for the bottom board then 1/2\" for the standoff then 2 1/4\" for the bin before you cut the first slot. Then another one at 2-1/4\" inch apart and so on until you get the last one that will be the bottom rest for the top bin. That determines the height of your overall cabinet as well.

Glue the standoffs into the dados using an extra piece of plywood laid across them as a caul to hold them down. You can see in the fourth pic here where the smaller standoffs are glued into the corner to complete the set.\nAfter I had my cabinets together I didn't really like the edges so I added some small strips of aspen to the front to match the workbench.

Make the support as long as all of your cabinets put together and the width the same as the cabinet depth. Also choose your 2x4 studs for the support carefully - since it will be holding a lot of weight across the gap you need some good wood.

Converting the scooter/truck to RC is all done, My original plan was rather basic..the scooters speed n direction was a handle bar mounted thumb lever, push forward and pull back respectively for travel. I planned to remount this under the cab n connect it to an rc servo via a control rod, prob would of worked but the scooters controller was old n did cut out now n then. So in the bin it went.\nThe scooter is 24v and its motor rated at 650w. So, i need to know how many amps the motor will pull under full load and source a controller of a higher rating, so, 650w\u00f724v=27A. I need to find an rc speed controller rated at 24v input and have an output capable of delivering over 30A . Straight away input voltage of this in RC is classed as High Voltage(HV). It needed to have a reverse function and needed to be for a brushed motor. Rc is usually either brushed or brushless, two or three motor wires respectively. Unbeleivably i found exactly what i needed, in the form of a HV speed controller for an RC boat. I used a watt meter and found under full load the motor pulled 23A. The controller i purchased was an 'Mtroniks Viper Marine40 HV' (40A) . i fitted inline 30A fuses just before the motor to further protect 80 quids worth of speed controller !\nSteering was the next big issue. A Servo to turn lock to lock while the trucks travelling would need some power, never mind when stationary, so I am looking for a servo with massive torque. A standard servo will give upto around 10kg of torque at a certain speed, dependent on its input voltage. Again servos can be bought in HV to gain higher torque. Larger servos in their physical size can also be found. So i needed a massive servo, HV as well? .... At first I ordered a giant scale high voltage servo rated at 120 kg of torque, the servo got bolted into a metal box which I welded to the chassis, and connected to the steering arm with another tie rod i bought from ebay as a spare part for another scooters steering assemble, i simply measured the length i needed and found one that was slightly longer, as i would either adjust its threads or cut to suit. Unfortunately what was needed to turn those wheels with all that weight above was yet more power, so a second was purchased. I did find it difficult to setup the servos to work in perfect tandem throughout their travel as they had to be mounted in different positions,. My RC transmitter is a computerised 10 channel TX with endless settings so I got it close mechanically and fine tuned it digitally !\nOnto lights yay...easy fun bit. loads n loads of 12v led lights. X2 Voltage regulators have been installed to drop the 24v down to the voltage required by the servos at 12v n lights at 12v.

It is an excellent product though! It will bond to concrete, brick, stone, mortar, wood, iron, steel and cured epoxy mortars. It is shrink free, insensitive to moisture during application, it has high tensile and flexural strength and is full of mold inhibitors. I live in Japan, so I bought a local brand, but you can easily find an epoxy mortar and grout with a quick Google search.\nThe epoxy grout is rubbed over the tiles. It is made from two different resins mixed with a filler making it is very waterproof and bettered suited to harsher cleaning products. This stuff sets super quickly too.\nThis step is tiling on the shelves\nOne shelf at a time:\nSmear the epoxy mortar onto a shelf and then place the tiles in it.

The LED strip doesn't bend well, so in the future, we might go a different direction for this type of setup, but it worked well enough! We also used hot glue periodically to hold down areas that didn't stick as well.\nThe Arduino (The \"Brain\")\nWe used an Arduino Micro for this to control the LEDs that light up the sign. There are lots of off the shelf LED controllers available but we enjoy coding it ourselves. It gives us more control and allows us to change things whenever we want, which is right up our alley! Along with the LEDs (300 sequential LEDs, all in a single strip), there\u2019s the Arduino Micro, a small breadboard, a 100uF capacitor, a 470ohm resistor, and a barrel jack for the 5V power source.\nPowering Everything\nThe Arduino uses a USB micro adapter for its power and the LEDs are powered externally by a separate 5V power adapter. Because there are 300 LEDs and they\u2019ll be using a lot of power, its recommended to power them separately and not through the Arduino. Since both the Arduino and the LEDs use a 5V power source, we could have spliced the one wall adapter to power them both\u2026but in our case, it was easier to just use two cords. We might upgrade it in the future to simplify once we\u2019re sure we\u2019ll stick with this configuration long-term.\n\nA Mini Breadboard?\nThe LED manufacturer recommends putting a 100-1000uF capacitor on the positive/negative terminals between the power input the LEDs to prevent any surges from damaging the LEDs, so we did that (100uF). Additionally, they recommend putting a 470ohm resistor between the data pin of the LEDs and the Arduino for the same reason, so we did that too. Since we didn\u2019t have a circuit board to solder these extra components to, we used the breadboard as a junction to get the capacitor and resistor in place. We also used it as a junction for the power and ground jumpers, since it was there.\n\nThe Code\nWe\u2019re using FastLED, which is an excellent free library available for Arduino that makes it super simple to make LEDs do\u2026basically whatever you want. You can choose which type of LEDs you\u2019re using and then use some really simple APIs to control them. Highly recommended if you\u2019ve not used it before! Otherwise, the code is dead simple! Choose your LED type, figure out how many there are, then tell them what to do.\nIf you'd like to see the actual code, check it out here: https://thewickedmakers.com/projects/how-to-make-a...\n\nTIP: If you don't want to do any of this, you can pick up off-the-shelf LED controllers which are just as awesome.

The one problem, which I'm sorting out in this instructable, is to lower the height of the tailstock centre. It's about 1mm higher that the headstock centre which is unacceptable for long turning and drilling. After a lot of thought and browsing the Internet for a solution, and finding nothing, I decided to try and skim the upper base of the tailstock myself. To do this I would need to hold the tailsock firmly on it's side on the cross slide and to use a fly cutter to do the skimming. As I don't own a fly cutter I had to make one.\nDesigns and videos for fly cutters are aplenty so I chose to use one of the simple ideas which I could turn on my lathe and then work out how to make the tool holder slots. I have sort-of followed the design in this drawing. I don't think the dimensions are critical.\nPay close attention, however, to the slot holding the cutting tool in place. The point of the cutter must lie along the centre line of the holder and it is crucial that you make the slot on the correct side of the centre line. If you study the images and drawing, and think of the direction of the spinning cutting tool you will see that, because of the angle of the cutting tool, it can only be on the one side.", "title": "Homemade Fly Cutter - From Scrap Steel", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Homemade-Fly-Cutter-From-Scrap-Steel/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I needed a bit of round bar about 30mm in diameter and I determined to find some scrap.

Again I remind you to be careful of which side of this line you will make your slot. You can cut it on the wrong side. It will depend on whether the 10 degree angle is towards you or away from you. Picture the cutting tool in action as it spins in the chuck. If you get this wrong the cutting point cannot line up with the scribed centre line across the face of the tool. I set the angle of the 10 degrees in my case with the tool pulled in towards me (see image) and clamped the tool post down - this must remain clamped until all the milling is complete. As we are using the quick change tool post to hold the work the work, together with the quick change tool post holder can be lifted out and replaced without the 10 degree angle being changed..\nUsing the set up I have and using an 8mm end mill you will need to set the top edge of the end mill to run along the scribed line.\nThe depth of the tool holder slot will be determined by the dimension of the cutting tool you will be using.

This milled cut of mine was about 10mm deep.\nNote: To keep chatter to a minimum I tightened up the lathe saddle plates and the gib slides on both the cross slide and the compound slide.

I used a scroll saw to round the ends of each hole but this can also be accomplished by sanding, using a jig saw, band saw, or even a wood chisel. By adding the curved ends and slightly opening the jig I can now fit a slightly larger dowel in the next downsized hole.\nFor example, if I were to take a 1\" dowel and put it in the 1\" hole in the jig it will freely turn as I drill it. But by moving the 1\" dowel down to the 3/4\" hole size I can squeeze the jig together and hold it with my hand or clamp it so that the dowel cannot turn when drilled.

The height was determined by dividing overall plies, as opposed to a specific measurement like 3/8\". There are/were 11 plies, so I cut through 5 of them on this first pass. The fence position was set and a stop block was clamped to the edge of the table at a distance of 12 1/2\" from the center of the bit [Fig. 1]. The second tier was cut with a 3/4\" straight bit - through the remaining 6 plies.\nNote: Don't move the fence or stop block, just change the bit and make the cut [Fig. 2].\n\nFor the bottom layer, I wanted something thin, but dense. The available 1/4\" plywood in my area is low quality, so my go to material is usually 3/16\" hardboard. I cut a piece a tad larger than necessary, spread glue on the bottom face of the plywood (the side with the 1\" slot), centered it on the hardboard, added another 3/4 board to help disperse pressure, and applied 104lbs of weight - shout out to Bowflex.\nNote: Be mindful with the glue near the center slot.

I started with the hole in the edge of my router table top because I wanted it vertically centered for strength. It's just a matter of setting the fence height, holding the tool firmly against the table edge, and making the plunge cut. Without making any adjustments to the machine, I made the same cut in the center of the 3/4\" strip. The domino was then glued into the 3/4\" strip.\n\nYou could do the same thing with a dowel peg. In that case, I would drill the hole through the 3/4\" strip using the drill press. I would then clamp it to the edge of the table (flush with the tabletop) and use it as a guide to drill the matching hole in the table.

A center hole was marked and drilled at 5/16\" diameter. Two side holes are drilled at 1/2\" diameter - 1\" in from each end [Fig. 1]. With the jig affixed to the router table using the front stop and retaining peg, this board was butted up to the back table edge, securely clamped, and used as a template to transfer hole locations [Fig. 2]. I drilled just deep enough to mark the center point, using a 5/16\" brad tip bit for the center hole and a 1/2\" forstner bit for the two side holes.\n\nThe actual holes were drilled using the drill press and forstner bits:\n3/8\" for the center hole so that the bolt wouldn't bind - drilled full depth (all the way through).\n3/4\" for the side holes, so the pegs wouldn't bind and get stuck - drilled around 1/2\" deep.\n\nTo elongate the 3/8\" hole into a slot, I used a 3/8\" straight bit on the router table - same fence settings that were used to cut the key way. I made a poor choice in cut direction, which resulted in one end of my slot being torn up. Instead of remaking the entire deck, I drilled out my mistake with a 1\" forstner bit and plugged the hole with a section of 1\" dowel [Fig. 4].

The bottom mark is used to drill a 7/8\" recess for a T-nut. The top mark is used to drill a hole for the 5/16\" countersunk bolts. I used a step bit for this hole, which worked magnificently.\n\nAt this point, I took the time to round the front end of the keys, so that they would slide all the way to tend of the rounded key way. I traced a socket and shaped the part using a 4\" disc sander. The T-nuts were hammered into place and then the bolts were shortened for a perfect fit, using an angle grinder for stock removal and the disc sander to remove burrs, as well as flatten the bottom of the bolt.\n\nPivot Pins\nThe pivot pin location is 1\" in from the front edge. A hole is then drilled for your pin material of choice. I made two versions since I'll be making discs for various projects and was indecisive.\n\nVersion 1: 1/8\" steel rod. I cut the rod with bolt cutters and deburred the edges with the strip sander. It was glued in place with a bit of epoxy.\n\nVersion 2: 5/8\" dowel. I cut the dowels to length using a small parts crosscut sled on the table saw. It was glued in place with wood glue.\n\nHow It Works\nAs you tighten the bolt, it bottoms out on the hardboard and presses the key upwards - lock in tightly and flush with the top of the deck.\n\nThe long keys actually work better since you can clamp them to the front edge of the table while tightening the bolt. The sort keys have a tendency to shift a bit.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXJ/UDOY/JR6OKE0O/FXJUDOYJR6OKE0O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLH/9Z13/JR6OKE1X/FLH9Z13JR6OKE1X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMN/KPVG/JR6OKE36/FMNKPVGJR6OKE36.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F13/LN2O/JR6OKE4K/F13LN2OJR6OKE4K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2T/6CKT/JR6OKE63/F2T6CKTJR6OKE63.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHV/HRM3/JR6OKE7C/FHVHRM3JR6OKE7C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMO/MZQL/JR6OKE7D/FMOMZQLJR6OKE7D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA2/9CG6/JR6OKE7F/FA29CG6JR6OKE7F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM9/98PR/JR6OKE7G/FM998PRJR6OKE7G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBJ/ON9D/JR6OKE7H/FBJON9DJR6OKE7H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX9/DT5Y/JR6OKE7I/FX9DT5YJR6OKE7I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5I/WTTK/JR6OKE7K/F5IWTTKJR6OKE7K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB5/GJRF/JR6OKE7M/FB5GJRFJR6OKE7M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU3/ZVJO/JR6OKE7R/FU3ZVJOJR6OKE7R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8M/OR5R/JR6OKE7W/F8MOR5RJR6OKE7W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLS/J9DA/JR6OKE7X/FLSJ9DAJR6OKE7X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDO/UGMZ/JR6OKE7Z/FDOUGMZJR6OKE7Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5R/EAPA/JRYUT84S/F5REAPAJRYUT84S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBT/Q3E8/JRYUT865/FBTQ3E8JRYUT865.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: The Pivot Pin Sliding Key"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "For the operation of cutting slots, I want a small sled, which will slide on the main deck like a rail.

The idea worked, just not very well. Even with magnets across the full width of the pouch it was only held very loosely.\nI took the metal out of the flap, and decided to see if I could fit the magnets in there. They fit, with some gentle persuasion, and held the flap closed much more securely. All I needed was a way to attach the magnets to the body of the pouch. A short length of paracord with the internal thread removed was the perfect way to attach them.\nTo stop the magnets moving inside the paracord I cut a small length of plastic tubing (from a cotton wool bud) to put between them (photos 3 & 4).

Slots are 2-1/4\" in from ends. Slots end 1/2\" from right side and 1\" from left side. These slots will allow for adjustment of the center foot. Cut the slots using your preferred method. I like to predrill the ends of the slots and use the router table to cut the remaining part. Setting up a fence on your drill press table really helps here. It is not critical that the slots are exactly 2-1/4\" from each end - but it is critical that the spacing of the slots and holes for the threaded inserts be the same. Leaving the drill press fence in place and using it for all of the holes aids in this.\nDo similar slots for the balance support upright.

The holes should be 2-1/4\" in from the ends (to match the distance between slots in last step) and centered on the width of the leg. For the 1/4\"-20 EZ-Loks listed, I find 11/32\" holes work well. If you use another brand of threaded insert, drill your holes to the size required. It may be a little fussy, but I like to counterbore the holes just a bit with a 1/2\" drill bit to allow the heads to sit flush, or slightly below, the surface. Go slow and steady so the drill doesn't grab and go too deep. Drill the same holes in the center of one side of the left leg (use your fence again). These will hold threaded inserts that allow the balance support foot to be adjusted.\nInsert 1/4\"-20 threaded inserts into these holes. I like to use a dab of general purpose glue like Elmer's ProBond Advanced to help secure the inserts over time. If you use a polyurethane glue like Gorilla Glue, use it very sparingly so that it doesn't expand over the top or into the threads.\nSand all the pieces as desired, but especially the surfaces that will be sliding against each other during adjustment.

A great example of one of these projects is to extract the hardware out of a cheap plastic screwdriver and turn it into a one-of-a-kind tool by crafting your own unique handle. This saves some cash relative to the screwdriver wood turning kits available online, and turning tool handles is a fun, straightforward beginner project that gives you something you can regularly use in your shop. These can also be quick projects to give away as gifts during the holidays, as a custom made tool will be much more appreciatively received than a pre-assembled tool purchased right off of the store shelf.\nSo I made a trip to my local big box hardware store and picked up a few Husky screwdrivers for about $3 a piece. These are the multi-bit models that have a long shank which holds a double-sided bit on each end and locks into a sort of collet within the screwdriver body itself.

I will be making four custom screwdriver handles with various materials that all have their own unique appearance, so the sky is the limit on your design and creativity. To get the blank ready for turning on the lathe, there are a few important steps that need to be taken, and some of these will be specific to the hardware you extracted from the cheap plastic screwdriver.\nFirst off, select the material that you wish to use for the handle. Tropical hardwoods are a great choice as they offer unique colors and grain patterns, but you want to make sure that you are using a wood with a medium to high density for a tool handle that will get heavy use. For my blanks, I'll be using a piece of padauk, a chunk of spalted beech, a piece of ash that I'll torrify with a blowtorch after turning, and a some fancy acrylic square stock.\nYou want to make sure that your blank is at least 6\" long (something closer to 8-10\" will give you more material to work with on the lathe, even if the final handle ends up being half of this length), and needs to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 2\" thick. When turning on the lathe, having a blank that is the same size in its width and thickness will save time and result in an easier cut with less chance of tear out. So I ripped all of my blanks to 6-8\" long and about 2\" square.\nNext, we need to square the two ends of the blank. This can be accomplished a variety of ways (miter saw, crosscutting on a table saw, disc sander) but having perfectly square and parallel ends is crucial in helping to mount the blank in the chuck and to drill a straight hole into the blank. After squaring the ends, we need to find the approximate center point on the two ends of the blank. On a square blank, simply use a straight edge to connect opposite corners of the ends, and the intersection of these lines will be your center point. If you're using a round blank, do your best to draw a few lines across the diameter of the ends and these approximate intersection points will be close to your center point. If you're using a particularly hard wood or an acrylic blank for your handle, now is a good time to round over the corners of your blank on the disc sander. This will reduce the likelihood of catastrophic tear out when you begin turning it into round on the lathe.\nIn order to mount the hardware inside the handle, we'll have to drill a couple of holes to accommodate the size of the hardware. This is a step that will vary depending on what sort of screwdriver hardware you acquired. For me, I have to drill two holes for each part of the hardware set: the collet, and the shank that holds the bits. Drilling these holes can be accomplished on a drill press, but I find the easiest method is to mount the blank in the lathe chuck and use a drill chuck in the tail stock to recess the holes (you must have perfectly square and parallel ends to use this method). This allows you to ensure that your mounting holes are in the exact same plane that your final piece will be turned to, guaranteeing that the screwdriver shank will be perfectly perpendicular to the finished handle.\nSo I first used a 5/8\" forstner bit to recess a 1 1/4\" deep hole, and then swapped this out for a 1/2\" drill bit and drilled this to 3 3/4\" deep. Again, these exact hole diameters and depths will likely change slightly depending on your hardware. Make sure that you test drill a hole for the collet on a piece of scrap wood. You want this fit to be tight but not excessively so - too loose and it will be tough for the adhesive to hold the hardware in place, but too tight and you'll be trying to hammer an epoxy covered collet into a hole on your finished handle.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIP/9UFW/JSUOTX6N/FIP9UFWJSUOTX6N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMZ/ONXT/JSUOTX7E/FMZONXTJSUOTX7E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSO/UVIG/JSUOTX7F/FSOUVIGJSUOTX7F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F44/LQPC/JSUOTX8L/F44LQPCJSUOTX8L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F92/HNXX/JSUOTXAR/F92HNXXJSUOTXAR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6U/BBA9/JSUOTXAT/F6UBBA9JSUOTXAT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Prepare Your Handle Blank"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Ferrules are an important part of wooden tool handles. Aside from offering a decorative element, these improve the strength of the handle and reduce the chance of the wood splitting if the tool is put into heavy use or dropped on the floor. While you can buy premade ferrules online, it's easy to make your own in only a few minutes.\nI find the best material for handle ferrules is copper pipe. Copper is easy to cut, doesn't require any special tools, and allows for several decorative options. I picked up a few 1\" wide, 2\" long copper couplings from the hardware store and these offered enough material to make several ferrules. I usually look to make my ferrules between 1/2' and 1\" long, depending on the look I'm going for. So once you've figured out the length you desire, place the copper piece in a vise and use a hacksaw to cut it to size. Begin by taking a few light passes on the copper tube to strike a line, and and then begin cutting down. Remember, hacksaws are designed to be a two-handed tool - using only one hand makes it difficult to get a straight, controlled cut. Only light pressure is needed to cut through the copper tube, so focus on keeping your cut as straight as possible.\nOnce the desired length of copper tube has been cut off, I like to take it to the disc sander to clean up and square the cut end. Copper is very thermally conductive, meaning that it can heat up very quickly. Use a pair of pliers to hold the ferrule while you press it into the disc sander. Very light touches will remove a good amount of material, and holding the copper against the abrasive cutting wheel for too long can produce so much heat that it can actually alter the color of the copper (more on that later...), so go at it easily until you're happy with the shape and finish. (NOTE: if you have a jagged edge even after hitting it on the disc sander, a deburring tool can quickly clean up the edge so that it's nice and smooth to the touch.)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Y/3ZNZ/JSUOTXFP/F1Y3ZNZJSUOTXFP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBW/YGOD/JSUOTXFQ/FBWYGODJSUOTXFQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOZ/XU4P/JSUOTXFR/FOZXU4PJSUOTXFR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Make the Ferrule"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "There are two solid options for how to turn your blanks on the lathe: turning between centers, or turning in a chuck. With a project this small, you will have no issues turning your blank between centers. To do this, take your spur center out of the lathe and place it on the center point on one end, hammering down with a dead blow mallet to seat the spurs (if you're paying attention to grain direction in your handle, the spur center side will be the butt end of your handle). After remounting this on the lathe, you can line up the live center on your tail stock and do your best to place this right in the center point of the hole that you drilled for the hardware. (NOTE: it can be difficult to seat the live center perfectly in the hardware hole, and if you're off by just a couple of millimeters you will end up turning a handle that is not perfectly perpendicular to the holes you drilled, which results in the screwdriver shank coming out of the handle at an angle. This is one of the reasons I prefer drilling and turning in the chuck). Since I elected to mount the blank in the chuck and recess my holes with a drill chuck, I swapped in the live center on the tail stock and after tightening down, I'm ready to roll.\nI'll be using carbide insert turning tools on this project, as they are a quick and easy way to rough out and detail small pieces on the lathe. I begin with a roughing tool to quickly turn the blank into round. I usually start initially at a slower speed (400-500 RPMs) to avoid getting too much tear out on the corners. Another option here is to remove the corners of the blank on the bandsaw, disc sander, or a hand plane to get the piece approximately round. One way to determine how round your blank is without turning the lathe off repeatedly is to lightly rest the arm of your cutting tool on top of the blank while it's spinning. A perfectly round blank will let the tool ride smoothly on the top of the piece, while something that isn't quite round yet will produce a lot of chatter. (NOTE: when turning acrylic blanks, you need to have the lathe speed turned up much higher - in the neighborhood of 2500 RPMs. Otherwise it can be very easily to get a ton of chip out.)\nOnce your blank is round, it's time to cut the tenon for your ferrule. While it's best to shoot for cutting a tenon that is the exact length of your ferrule, it's better to have a slightly longer tenon than a shorter one. You can always sand this down to size at the disc sander after assembly, if needed. Holding the ferrule so that it's lined up flush with the tail stock end of my blank, I use a pencil to scribe a small line where the end of the ferrule is. Then I place the pencil right on that line and manually turn the lathe spindle to transfer this mark to the entire blank. I use either digital calipers or a manual inside caliper to get the exact diameter of the inside of the ferrule, and then take this to the lathe.\nUsing a parting tool or square carbide insert cutter, I begin bringing the tenon down to size right up to the line I just drew. It's VERY easy to cut the tenon down too small, so stop to regularly check your tenon against the calipers. Once you're almost there (we're talking at most a millimeter larger than the inside diameter of the ferrule), stop there. Again, it's better to have an ever-so-slightly thicker tenon than one too thin.\nTurning the shape of the handle is all about feel. Having a handle that's too thick can make it difficult to grip properly, but too thin can mean that it wont feel beefy enough to put a lot of pressure into. Curves are always a nice detail to impart, but improperly placed ones will make the handle feel uncomfortable in your hand. I recommend taking a moment to grab some small hand tools sitting around your shop (other screwdrivers, chisels, handsaws, etc) and see which ones feel the most comfortable in both their size and shape.\nOne of the great things about turning is that you don't really know what the final shape of your handle will be until you start cutting. The finished piece is hiding somewhere inside that chunk of wood. It's up to you to find it. Using your preferred cutting tool, remove material slowly and consider both the aesthetic and tactile shape as you turn your curves.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBT/RRGP/JSUOUBOT/FBTRRGPJSUOUBOT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Initial Turning"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "As you approach your finished shape, you want to determine how long the handle will end up being. Stop the lathe as you come to a shape you like, and grip the piece on the lathe. Make sure that you're pleased with the feel and comfort of the handle, and determine where you would like the butt of the handle to be. I find that I like my handles to extend around a half of an inch past where my palm grips it. Use a pencil to strike a line while manually spinning the spindle to encircle the blank with this mark. Using a parting tool, bring down the diameter of the waste wood behind this mark to a small cylinder - something less than an inch. A round carbide cutter is great for removing material on both sides of this area, rounding over the butt of the handle as much as possible.\nWith your handle shaped and approximately brought down to length, ramp up the speed of your lathe and use a scraper or square radius cutting tool to shear off material very slightly, trying to make one pass across the length of the handle. This should give you a very fine surface free of tool marks and small imperfections. Now it's time to grab your 100 grit cutting tool (aka sandpaper) and begin easing the surface to a super smooth finish. I like to use a scotch brite pad with sandpaper wrapped around it to sand my pieces progressively through the grits. This gives you a cushion to press into your piece while preventing your fingers from getting too hot through the sandpaper. Work through the grits quickly (100/150/180/220/320) and flip between forward and reverse mode (if your lathe has this) to make sure that the grain is evenly removed in both directions. One consideration toward the end of this process is what sort of finish you're going to be using. If you prefer water-based finishes, it's important to lightly wet the piece before you sand at 180-220 grit to raise the grain. Not doing so will result in a rough-feeling surface once you've applied your finish. This isn't as much of a consideration when using oil-based finishes.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKT/YVZ2/JSUOTXK9/FKTYVZ2JSUOTXK9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F28/HJXI/JSUOTX6J/F28HJXIJSUOTX6J.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Final Turning and Sanding"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "With the turning and sanding steps done, you can now remove the piece from the lathe. You will likely have a candlestick-looking piece similar to the one above. In order to release the waste wood from the butt end of handle, use a bandsaw or handsaw to carefully cut away the little spindle on the bottom of the handle. You now have a rough unfinished butt end that needs to be addressed. I like to use a disc sander to very lightly shape the butt into a round surface that follows the bottom contours of the handle. Then, using the same grits that you did on the lathe, hand sand this surface going gradually higher up onto the handle at each grit. The finished product should be evenly smooth and feel great in your hand throughout the length of the piece.\nIn order to prep the handle for finish, take a shop towel or rag lightly wet with mineral spirits and rub the handle down. This will remove any surface dust from the sanding process, and will give you a chance to examine the surface to ensure that there are no unseemly tool or sanding marks that you may have overlooked previously. Address any if needed.\nFor finish, you have a TON of options. Do you want to feel the wood grain in the final piece, or have a super smooth, hardened surface that looks like glass? Do you prefer a satin finish, or something glossier and shiny? How much protection do you want the handle to have, as opposed to having a finish that's easily repairable? My go-to finish for almost all things woodworking is Arm-R-Seal from General Finishes. It really highlights the color of the wood, serves as a highly protective and highly glossy film, is easy to apply and feels great to the touch. But your options include lacquer, natural oils (danish, walnut or tung oils), an oil/wax mixture, or even CA glue if you want to finish your handle super quickly. Regardless of your desired choice, do your best to avoid getting any finish on the outer diameter of the tenon or the inside of your hardware hole. This will make it more difficult to install your hardware. For a tool that will get handled quite a bit, it's a good idea to do at least three coats of your desired finish to give it as much protection as possible, sanding lightly with 400-600 grit sandpaper in between coats.\nLastly, you need to decide what (if anything) to do with your copper ferrule. A natural, untouched copper ferrule can go great with your handle, but there are a few options you can explore to give your ferrule a more artistic look. In the examples that I've made for this Instructable, I created three distinctly different ferrules to help you see what some options look like (the acrylic handle didn't receive a ferrule). For my padauk handle, I left the copper unfinished, which produces a very clean and sleek appearance that matches the tropical hardwood. For my spalted beech handle, I used a flat black spray-on paint/primer that helps attract the eye to the dark spalting lines in the wood. And for the torrified ash handle, I used a blow torch to heat the copper to a high temperature, resulting in a striking mixture of color. These are only a few options you can choose from, but you can see that there are many directions you can go that help to highlight and compliment the appearance of your handle.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKE/8O2I/JSUOU6A7/FKE8O2IJSUOU6A7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMJ/ZMY5/JSUOTXK1/FMJZMY5JSUOTXK1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5G/IA6C/JSUOTXKD/F5GIA6CJSUOTXKD.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Final Shaping and Finish"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Now that you have a beautiful and functional wooden handle all finished, it seems like the perfect time to goop it up with a bunch of epoxy! I dread this step because it's so easy to mess up a piece that has taken a lot of time to create, but with some careful attention to detail, this step is pretty straight forward. First, lets talk about adhesives. My go-to adhesive for almost every project is epoxy, as it is void filling and will never come off... But you can use CA glue (aka super glue) if you don't have epoxy sitting around - this process can just be a little messier and doesn't give you as much working time to get everything perfect.\nFor both pieces of hardware, it's important to scuff up the face that will be glued to the handle with sandpaper to give a better surface for your adhesive to bond to. Prep your epoxy or CA glue and have some wet shop towels on hand. I began with the collet so that I could leave it in place while attaching the ferrule. Based on the diameter hole I drilled to insert this, it's pretty friction fit and doesn't need much epoxy. After spreading a small amount of epoxy on the interior edge of the hardware hole, I slid in the collet and pressed it against my workbench to ensure that it's perfectly flat with the end of the handle.\nFor the ferrule, it's important not to apply any epoxy to the area that's between 1/8\"-1/4\" from the handle end of the tenon. This will help avoid having to deal with any squeeze out on the handle end. Slide the ferrule onto the tenon, rotating it to spread the adhesive around evenly. Once it's fully seated, now is the time to wipe away any squeeze out with your wet shop towel. Find a way to hold your handle upright while this dries.

It has sat in my lumber stacks for the past 6 months until I had the time/motivation/inspiration to do something with it. Currently I don't have a really good place in my house to do work for my full time job.

I figured this was the best place to put a desk to do work at. I originally thought about a desk with three \"sides\", matching the bay window. However, I soured on that idea after awhile and decided to go with just one angle. For the base I wanted to try to make a \"floating\" system. The idea here is that from most common viewing angles (i.e. typical human height) you can't see that the desk top is resting on the base. Only if you get underneath will you be able to tell.

But then I found the advantage that came with being able to remove the router from its fixed location to a handheld unit. It meant, among other things, that I could use the wider router base as leverage.\nWith this instructable, I want to expand its usage. But let's take it's highly simple, maneuverability nature with us as we do it. Or why do it. Right?\nThese days there are a lot of people making resin tables with uneven surfaces. They're using logs, slabs and even sticks as the main body before they pour. I'm all for resin and all of its sticky properties, but unless those brave epoxy warriors are planning on doing a complete resin cover as it levels itself, there needs to be a way to level the wood. There also needs to be a way to level it as well, after all it set and cured.\nEnter Router Rails.\nNo, no, this isn't some high speed track where routers rush down train tracks, speeding on bearings.

No, need to be flat. Let's keep that in the forefront of our craniums. Buy shelfing rails that are flat and strong. With the \"U\" style shelf rails that I used, there's a lot of reinforced strength that should keep things straight, that is, of course, unless you choose narrow rails (or have a massive Triton router with the 3 1/4 hp motor. If that's the case, go industrial strength). Make sure of this when buying rails. I went with rails that had a 7/8\" section between the top and bottom of the \"U\". If yours is less, I cannot guarantee it will come out the same.\nLet's put this another way, if you choose a different size, godspeed young grasshopper. Throw a comment at the bottom of this and tell us all what you did differently. You'll have to use this instructable as more of a general guide as the sizes will be different. And, in this case, size does matter. We'll need to make absolutely sure that when the base is pressed into the rails that there is a snug fit; NOT a hammer-it-in-with-a-sledgehammer fit, but a nice, solid fit that you can do with your hands. The reason for this is simple: if you wedge it tight in the channel, you're taking a chance that deformation could occur. The bottom lip is not hardened steel and can deform with large amounts of pressure.\nSo, yeah, find a ruler and measure the inside area if you want this to be absolutely perfect. If you can't find the inside dimensions to be of that size, adjust the overall width (the part that fits into the brackets) to what will work.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMZ/QI0Q/JSPABHXX/FMZQI0QJSPABHXX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: A Few Cautionary Words on Selecting Rails"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Okay, no fancy words. This is the base. Not bass (fishy or instrumental), but base. It is quite literally the heart of this project. This means that we'll need to put a little time in making it to ensure that everything works in tandem. The rails are the arms that connect to the...well, heart. Maybe metaphors aren't my thing. We'll see.\nI've put the exact specs that I used with a 7/8\" inside diameter rail in a handy sketchup image attached to this step, so pour over it and soak it in. This will definitely be different (and maybe the only thing different) if you either can't find a 7/8\" ID rail or go larger. Again, I don't recommend going smaller, so proceed at your own risk.\nWe'll need to use a 1/2\" thick piece of plywood that will be the exact same size (not thickness, just width and length) as our 9\" x 9\" acrylic sheet that's attached to our router. Connected to that will be 4 pieces of wood. A top and bottom piece measuring 9\" x 1 1/2\" x 3/4\", and two side pieces (those that will fit in the rail) that measure 12\" x 7/8\" x 5/8\".\nWe'll also want to cut out a viewing hole out of the center that will also allow our router bit to pass through, as well as, well, being able to view what's below. You could get riskier and cut a larger diameter hole out so more viewing can be observed, but that is something you'll have to decide on your own as I have no idea how well it'll work. These are uncharted waters so boldly do as you must in safety.\nTo make the hole, make diagonals from one corner to the other on adjacent corners. This will form an 'X' in the middle. Simple enough. Use your compass and measure out a radius of 2\", set your needle point in the center and sketch out your 4\" centered circle. Next, cut out the circle.

Those dimensions are in the last step. I clamped it all together and added weight to make sure nothing moved during the drying stage.\nI used my Super easy spline jig to add splines to all 4 corners.\nGluing the base...and beyond!\nNow let's have a discussion about gluing our base together. I glued all my joints with the weakest joint possible, edge to edge. Is it enough strength for our router base? I have no idea, honestly. Titebond II glue proclaims to be stronger than wood when glued, but I have never done a comparison to see how strong it really is. There are a few options here. You could use my Super Easy Spline Jig, but that means a deep cut to get to the plywood center of the tootsie pop, which it will do easily. If you don't have my spline jig, there may be other spline jigs out there that will allow you the same thing.\nYou could also use biscuit joints to connect the pieces as well as dowel rods if you have a dowel rod jig. I can't recommend using screws as plywood is not meant to be screwed into the thickness, but it may work somewhat well if you used an appropriate pilot hole.\nTo recap: I used edge gluing when I glued all 4 pieces of wood (the sizes being in the last step) to my piece of plywood; but I used splines on all 4 corners to reinforce the wood. Gluing may be enough, but that is not what I did. I do not believe there is any danger in gluing alone (especially by the manufacturers description (and let's limit this to titebond II)) except for a damaged project if things head south.\nAfter it's been glued and allowed to cure, I used a belt sander to clean the edges.\nFinalizing the edges", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAJ/VWR0/JSOZ3DBB/FAJVWR0JSOZ3DBB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAV/0PUN/JSOZ3DB9/FAV0PUNJSOZ3DB9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG4/NX0O/JSOZ3DBE/FG4NX0OJSOZ3DBE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ4/L7ZM/JSOZ3DBF/FZ4L7ZMJSOZ3DBF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8V/PIS6/JSOZ3DBI/F8VPIS6JSOZ3DBI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBX/SOO3/JSOZ3DBK/FBXSOO3JSOZ3DBK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Edge Gluing and Beyond"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Now we'll cut out the rail ties (do you get the play on words here?). The nice thing about these shelf rails is that there are screw holes every 11 1/4\" inches. Can you guess how far apart we'll put the rail ties? Yes, 11 1/4\" inches apart. We'll cut 6 rail ties at 10 1/4\" out of the 7/8\" square dowel rods. These ties will be placed one by one inside the rail at each of the 6 screw holes. Yes, there are 7 screw holes in these rails, but the center one will be for the base, so we'll leave that one alone.\nWith the rail facing up in the air (the bottom of the 'U' facing up), we'll slide the dowels in from underneath until all have been inserted, again lining them up under the screw holes.\nOKAY, hopefully that wasn't too much to bite off. When in doubt, watch the video. By the way, clicking on the links in each of these steps will take you directly to the exact place where the step being described is being performed.\nNow we'll drill 1/8\" pilot holes in each of the 6 ties ends (through the screw holes) before putting a #10 x 1\" wood screw in each hole. We'll then insert the base (again, not squeezed in so tight that it deforms the metal. You should be able to lightly press it in). Find the center of the base and match it up with the center of the rails, the 7th hole, which conveniently is the most center hole.\nBe careful or you'll do what I did when drilling a hole in the base through the screw holes: I underestimated the width of the wood. Drill a 1/2\" deep pilot hole with the 1/8\" drill bit and put a #10 x 1/2 wood screw through the rail and into the base.\nOnce this screw is in we'll flip the rail down on the bench so that the 6 square dowel rods are in the upright, vertical position as well as the base.

The toggle bolt will need to lock in place after it hits the plastic base of the router, so test where that spot sweet spot should be. Squeeze the lever down until it locks in place, then tighten the set bolts that came with the clamp so that it doesn't move. Of course, a little threadlock would work great here or even some locking nuts, but so far I haven't needed to use anything other than what came with the toggle bots.\nToggle it, just a little bit...\nCenter your handles on the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 6th ties, drill your pilots with your 1/8\" bit and put in (8) #10 x 1/2\" combo pan head screws (dome top, flat underside).

Well, kinda. This instructable assumes you have a 9\" x 9\" x 3/16\" piece of acrylic attached to your router. But that's not fair. Why? Because who has a 9\" x 9\" x 3/16\" piece of acrylic attached to their router? Okay, I see a few hands up in the back, but I want this to be universal. I want this very clever way of flattening a surface to be available to anyone and everyone interested.\nAs each and every router is different, I cannot be more than slightly helpful for this step. Your router should have a base on it already. The best thing that you can do is find the center of a piece of 9\" x 9\" x 3/16\" acrylic, draw a line from corner to corner. Now you'll have an \"X\" in the center. If you take the base off your old router, you can center up the \"X\" through the hole in the center of the old router base. You'll find the screw holes that attached the old base and mark them on the acrylic.\nThis is where it gets tricky. The screw holes need to be sloped as your old screws were recessed in the plastic. You'll have to mimic how your old router base was attached. This will include making pilot holes. Again, each and every router is different, so it wouldn't be fair of me to try to list every router screw for every router. Besides, that would be cruel to me, and I've been nothing but nice to you...haven't I?\nOnce you've rigged up your acrylic to your router, you'll need to plunge a hole through the plastic...very carefuly. Acrylic is very strong, but it gets picky when it is cut or drilled in to. You'll need to find a good bit, preferably one that you'll use with your Router on Rails, and slowly lower your router into the plastic. Of course, for this method you'll need to have a plunge router. If you don't have one of these, carefully use a forestner bit and drill out the appropriate sized hole in the direct center of the \"X\".", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9J/WSXP/JSPAE0PT/F9JWSXPJSPAE0PT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3O/YRI1/JSPAE0PU/F3OYRI1JSPAE0PU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Installing a Platform to Your Router"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Okay, another step that's not entirely part of this project, but necessary to make the project work. To flatten a tabletop or a log, or whatever it is that needs flattenin', I recommend using a bowl router bit. Stay far away from the 1/4\" diameter shaft as you'll be using every bit of the...bit to route with. My router bit is a bowl bit with a 1/2\" shank on it that's about 1 1/4\" wide. It's made by Freud and is an excellent tool that I have used many times for projects like this.\nHere's a few tips for you.\nNever let your router sit in one spot for too long as it is on or you will burn the wood below the router bit.\nEase into the material. Don't jam the bit into the wood or start with the bit touching the wood that's about to be removed.\nTake breaks. The bit gets very hot. Tighten the collet as you go. It'll loosen as it gets hot which will damage your work.\nNever use a dull bit, it will run on the wood instead of cutting it and can be dangerous.\nYou will need runners on either side of the wood you plan on cutting flat. As each set up is a little different, do a little research on how to add runners next to your project. As the Router Rails is something I concocted for a project many years ago, I don't know how widely used it is. I do know that router sleds are popular. Runners for those should be easy to find and make. These runners are important as they create a flattening plane that you'll want to match your router to.\nThe runners you use MUST be longer than the project you plan on cutting as the router bit will need to come to the edge of your project. Remember that the edge of your project still needs to have proper runner space for the 5 1/8\" half of your Router Rails.\nMake small passes. Don't try to cut too much at one time.\nI do have plans for making runners in the future (something I think is unique), but a pair of 4x4's should work just fine, so long as you plan everything out.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVH/IEC1/JSPAE0TA/FVHIEC1JSPAE0TA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEJ/P8P7/JSPAE3Z4/FEJP8P7JSPAE3Z4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZY/1188/JSPAE40K/FZY1188JSPAE40K.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Type of Bit to Use and General Operation"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Thank you for giving this page a look.

You tape the front edge down of the game board and students slide a penny across the table trying to land on the images.

I had mentioned I like woodworking to the boxing coach one day and he asked me if I could make a rack to hold all of the medicine balls the gym has. Currently they occupy a corner of the mats and it would be good to get it a little more organized. I thought this would be a fun little challenge so I happily agreed.\nThe Design:\nI first identified where in the gym the coaches would want the rack to be located. This helped me to identify the physical constraints I was working with. I had about a 4.5 foot wide area to work with. I decided to make a three level rack that was 4 feet wide and about 4 feet tall. I hadn't decided on the width at the time but it ended up being around 9 inches deep.\nMaterials:\nA spare 2\" x 6\" x 10' I had lying around.\nAn 8' 4\" x 6\" pine beam I got for free off of craigslist.\n6 foot long 1\" diameter oak dowel\n\nTools:\nTable Saw\nChop Saw\nRouter\nRound Over Bit (Whiteside is a great brand for router bits)\nDrill/Drill Press\nForstner Bit (1\" Diameter)\nClamps\nWood Glue (I used titebond III)\nSome Screws\nStain of your choice, I used Minwax Red Elm and Minwax Ebony\nOrbital Sander w/ Sandpaper", "title": "Medicine Ball Rack", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Medicine-Ball-Rack/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I was kind of making up this project as I went along. The first thing I decided to do was cut the horizontal rails. I needed 6, 2 for each level.\n- First cut the 10 foot beam down into more manageable sections on the chop saw. I cut mine to 4 foot sections.\n- If you want to clean up the edges on a jointer, more power to you. Otherwise, you can trim the sides with your table saw. I choose to do both. I did one pass through the jointer to take of a 16th and get a nice edge to work with. Then I ran them down the table saw and trimmed the 2\" x 6\" down until it was just a hair over 4\" across.\n- Now rip these sections down the middle. If you have done it right and taken the table saw kerf into account, you should have two pieces that are each 2\" across.\n- I didn't touch the other dimension of the pieces as I wanted these to be as solid as possible. This left me with 6 sticks that were each 2\" x 1.5\" x 48\".\n- This is optional but I choose to take my router and a 1/2\" round over bit and take off one edge. This will eventually be the part of the rail making contact with the medicine ball.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSD/V6O8/JSOZ3FLG/FSDV6O8JSOZ3FLG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTB/D8AP/JSOZ3FM6/FTBD8APJSOZ3FM6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: The Horizontal Rails"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I decided to use the big pine 4\" x 6\" to make the vertical legs.\n- First, I cut the 8 foot beam down so I had a 4.5' section.\n- Now, take the beam and rip it in half on your table saw. Luckily I have a giant old table saw that can take a 14\" blade, this made ripping the beam down pretty easy. I choose to rip it across the shorter side. This left me with two pieces each ~2\" x 6\".\nI decided the best way to mount the horizontal rails was to cut recesses or pockets into the vertical legs for them to sit into. I could glue these into place as well as put a screw in them to keep things strong.\nMark out the spacing you want between the different rack levels on the pieces you just cut. This is kind of up to you depending upon how big of medicine balls you are working with and your dimensions.\nWith the spacing marked, go and mark out on the short sides the exact locations you want to put the horizontal rails. Now you need to cut out the material from the vertical leg to create the pocket. You can do this using a table saw and cross cut fence or just using a hand saw and chisels. I choose to use the table saw just because it was faster and I didn't want to make a particular emphasis of this piece being crafted with hand tools.\nCut these pockets out of both sides (see the picture if this is confusing).\nNow for the fun twist. To get the medicine ball to sit securely on the rail, there needs to be some minimum distance between them. I had originally planned to just put the rails into each side of the vertical legs and calling it done. However, I started having nightmares about the rack not being stable. Therefore, I decided to split the two pieces I had just made and space them apart using dowels.\nPretty straightforward, just set your fence accordingly and rip the two vertical legs in half, right down the middle.\nWe are 90% of the way there.\nLast thing to do is drill hols for the dowels. I choose to put 4 in each side, splitting the gaps between each of the horizontal rails. You can do this with the appropriate size drill bit and a hand drill or drill press.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6P/AUN4/JSOZ3FMB/F6PAUN4JSOZ3FMB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F32/EYVG/JSOZ3FMK/F32EYVGJSOZ3FMK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI7/UQUT/JSOZ3FMI/FI7UQUTJSOZ3FMI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Vertical Legs"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I say to do the finishing now, before assembly, because it will be far easier to sand and stain everything while it is in pieces.\nThe bare pine is kind of boring, in my opinion, so I stained the vertical rails a dark ebony and the horizontal rails a red elm. The oak dowels I didn't stain.\nBy the way, cut the dowels down to the appropriate length to get your rack to have the desired width. In my case I cut them at 6 inches. 1/2 inch on each side would be pressed into the holes that we drilled. That would make my interior gap approximately 5 inches.\nTo recap, sand -> stain\nOnce everything cures/sets you can go for final assembly.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 3: Finishing"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Time to put this things together and go get a workout in.\nFirst you need to assemble the horizontal rails onto the vertical legs.

Get the dowels aligned and use hand clamps to slowly press everything together. Clean up any glue that was running and then let it set.\nCome back the next day and do any touch up/clean up that you feel is necessary.\nAnd you're in business!

By using 3/4'' electrical conduit for your main support you are able to insert 1/2'' electrical conduit into the 3/4'' pipe to extend on the outside ,creating even more storage.\nBy cutting plywood that fits in between your upright 2'' x 4'' and placing it on the conduit you can incorporate shelving into your rack, or make just a rack to be a shelving unit.\nThe rack in the picture is 12'- 0'' high 30'' wide with a pipe spacing of 16'' the individual ladders are spaced 3' -0'' apart.\nMaterial : 2'' x 4'' , 3/4'' and 1/2'' electrical conduit ( comes in 10'-0'' lengths), plywood for shelves.\n( 1 ) Once you have laid out how big and how many uprights you require, lay out your hole spacing.

One of the primary motivations for this project was to try a wireless charging receiver in conjunction with a battery in an LED light. I've seen a lot of people add wireless charging transmitters to anything and everything, but haven't seen wireless charging receivers used in many projects, so I wanted to try one out.\nThis is entered in the REMIX CONTEST -- if you enjoy it, I'd greatly appreciate your vote :) https://www.instructables.com/contest/remix2019/\nMake sure to check out the YouTube video at the top of this instructable, since often the video demonstration is helpful in understanding the instructions here.\nSince it has the wireless charging receiver, you can charge it with any Qi wireless charger (like those used for Androids and iPhones), or make your own custom wireless charging base to really take it up a notch. All the electronics are off the shelf parts from Amazon, including the music reactive sp106e LED controller. This controller is pretty darn cool. It does solid colors, patterns, and even has a built in microphone for music syncing. Music controllers I've tried in the past have always been too blinky/flashy - like an out of control strobe light. As a result, I've often gone through the tedious Arduino programming to create my own music controllers. But, this one has much improved music reactive programming, smoothly blending in and out of patterns, instead of using binary on/off programming.\nAs for the aesthetic design, the shape of the lamp was inspired by several other cube lamps I've seen, and particularly by Darbin Orvar's fantastic concrete light cube: https://www.instructables.com/id/Concrete-LED-Ligh...", "title": "Wirelessly-Charged Epoxy LED Cube Lamp", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Wirelessly-Charged-Epoxy-LED-Cube-Lamp/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "\u00b7 Melamine shelving \u2013 buy at local big box store\n\u00b7 black caulk\n\u00b7 Heat Gun: https://amzn.to/2seaErS\n\u00b7 Total Boat Epoxy Resin: https://amzn.to/2RFzYRS\n\u00b7 5V LED Strip: https://amzn.to/2Emga2h\n\u00b7 5V music sync LED controller: https://amzn.to/2PArObU\n\u00b7 LiPo Battery: https://amzn.to/2DVfFKZ\n\u00b7 Wireless Charging Receiver: https://amzn.to/2NeXBQp\n\u00b7 Wireless Charging Pad / Transmitter: https://amzn.to/2VaRZJH\n\u00b7 Battery Charging Protection Board: https://amzn.to/2BKdJF3\n\u00b7 Aluminum Foil Tape: https://amzn.to/2L36CK5\n\u00b7 Epoxy/Plastic Polish: https://amzn.to/2sljlQm\n\u00b7 Fine grit sandpaper (to 2000 grit): https://amzn.to/2smxPPW\n\u00b7 Cordless Drill & Driver: https://amzn.to/2F9y0b5\n\u00b7 world\u2019s Greatest Sander: https://amzn.to/2PLUJOB", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRT/0QZN/JSL37G3Y/FRT0QZNJSL37G3Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJK/8W8D/JSL37G44/FJK8W8DJSL37G44.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9V/SFA7/JSL37GTC/F9VSFA7JSL37GTC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: PARTS LIST"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The main form is cut from \u00be\u201d melamine, and has four sides with mitered joints and a base \u2013 pretty simple.

Slow hardener also helps pour thicker, by slowing the curing reaction (and thus reducing the heat produced by the reaction).\nFor each layer of epoxy, mix at a 2:1 ratio of epoxy to hardener. I recommend using paint cups so you can just pour straight into the cup. Then add 6 or 7 drops of black epoxy pigment. This is the pigment I used: https://amzn.to/2Ss1KkY\nLet the resin cure for 1.5 \u2013 2 hours, mix the next layer, and repeat until the form is full.

If they aren\u2019t two bad, you might be able to get away with using a disc sander and/or orbital sander. However, I found it easier to run all sides through the table saw to square them up. I would make 2-3 passes to cut up to the max height of the blade on a given side, then flip the cube over and make 2-3 passes to finish cutting off the other half of the same side. Then I repeated this for all four sides of the cube to square up the sides. Making multiple passes through the table saw allows you to push the cube through the saw more quickly, so that heat doesn\u2019t build up (which runs the risk of softening the epoxy and cutting unevenly).\nAfter squaring the sides at the table saw, it is time to carve out the cavity for the electronics. I used a forstner bit and router on the router table to carve this cavity in the bottom. However, I\u2019m not going to go into more detail on this step, since I would actually recommend using foam (e.g., pink insulating foam) to create an insert in the form when you pour. Pouring over a foam insert will provide a cavity in the cube right out of the form, so you don\u2019t have to waste epoxy by carving out the cavity later.\nAfter the cavity is created, use a 5/8\u201d forstner bit to create a tunnel for the wiring between the LEDs in the channel and the other electronics in the cavity. You\u2019ll drill from the channel to the middle of the cube, and then up from the middle of the cavity until you meet the first hole you drilled. The result is a sort of upside-down chimney between the cavity and the channel.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPP/1OSR/JSL37DN7/FPP1OSRJSL37DN7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI9/N0E9/JSL37DO7/FI9N0E9JSL37DO7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQK/9ZIR/JSL37EKH/FQK9ZIRJSL37EKH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPZ/HDH9/JSL37EJW/FPZHDH9JSL37EJW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMW/A5QM/JSL37EIR/FMWA5QMJSL37EIR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNK/KOJT/JSL37EHS/FNKKOJTJSL37EHS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F69/YTLJ/JSL37EHK/F69YTLJJSL37EHK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVL/2ZFE/JSL37G3S/FVL2ZFEJSL37G3S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRT/6LB5/JSL37G3L/FRT6LB5JSL37G3L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5W/EM2K/JSL37G3F/F5WEM2KJSL37G3F.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Rough Shaping the Cube"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "You\u2019ll want to wire up the electronics now and test the LED strips, before you cover them in epoxy, since they\u2019ll be in the cube permanently once cover them in white epoxy.\nHere are the electronic parts:\n- TP4056 charging protection board: https://amzn.to/2BKdJF3\n- pigtail power jacks: https://amzn.to/2tC9wyA\n- individually addressable 5V LED Strip: https://amzn.to/2Emga2h\n- SP106e 5V music sync LED controller: https://amzn.to/2PArObU\n- LiPo Battery: https://amzn.to/2DVfFKZ\n- Wireless Charging Receiver: https://amzn.to/2NeXBQp\n- Wireless Charging Pad / Transmitter (optional): https://amzn.to/2VaRZJH\n- 3-pin JST connectors: https://amzn.to/2Xo3xLq\n(1) Cut off the JST on the power/ground wires on the LiPo battery, and solder these wires to the Battery +/- terminals on the TP4056 board.\n(2) Connect the micro usb cable from the wireless charging receiver to the micro USB jack on the TP4056 board.\n(3) Solder the +/- output terminals on the TP4056 charging protection board to the +/- wires on a male pigtail power jack, then plug the power jack into the SP106e LED controller.\n(4) Cut a length of LED strip so that it wraps around all four sides of the channel in the cube.

It allows the woodworker to make things as simple as picture frames, or as complex as custom cabinetry, with simple straight cuts. Jigs for making pocket holes range from super simple to production-class machines. Price, naturally, increases with capability. For the casual woodworker, the modestly-priced jigs can be used to build almost anything the bigger units can - it just requires more manual setup and, therefore, time.\nThis plan will show how to build a more capable pocket hole workstation using one of the basic jigs and some simple woodworking. The workstation is portable, easy to build, and can make the drilling of accurate pocket holes quick and easy. The focus is on making a capable tool at a relatively low cost.

If you are willing to go without the dust collection port, a much simpler jig holder has been added as Step 4.\nThe heart of the work station is a \"pinch box\" that securely holds the jig. It must also allow easy adjustment of the jig to allow holes to be made in materials of different thicknesses. The jig fits into some shallow reliefs that keep the jig from being pushed backwards.\nFor whatever reason, the jig is made with a shallow 2-1/2 degree angle on the sides. The trickiest part of this whole project is getting the reliefs cut at that angle. Note: If you are comfortable sanding the sides of the jig flat, fitting this angle can be avoided. A disc or belt sander with a well-adjusted table would be ideal for this.\nFor this Instructable, I'll make the angled parts. Start with plywood (I use baltic birch for this one) 2-1/4\" wide that is thicker than the jig. Mine was not, so I glued two pieces together. Set the blade at a 2-1/2 degree and cut each end for the entire thickness. Use the jig to set the blade height on the table saw for the relief. I used a crosscut guide with a stop block to cut the relief approximately 1/16\" deep on each end. Next, cut the angled ends off 1/2\" from the relief. This gives you the two \"pinch blocks\".\nCut two pieces of plywood 3-1/4\" wide and 4-1/2\" long for the sides of the box. Place the pinch blocks on either side of the jig and measure the width (mine was 2-1/8\" as shown in the picture). Cut another piece of plywood 3-1/4\" wide and the length equal to your measurement in the last step for the back of the box.\nGlue the pinch blocks flush with the ends of the sides and insert the back on the opposite ends. Clamp as in the picture. I fastened the back in place with brad nails. Once the glue is dry, drill a hole in the center of each of the sides for a 1/4\" carriage bolt. Drill one side 1/4\" and the other side a bit larger. A 3-1/2\" carriage bolt is used to tighten the sides together to pinch the jig. Use a nut and washer to hold the carriage bolt in the side with the 1/4\" hole as in picture. A 1/4\"-20 star knob is used to tighten the pinch box onto the jig.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F86/1UZW/JSIUN7C7/F861UZWJSIUN7C7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJG/ZIVV/JSEZ5IL3/FJGZIVVJSEZ5IL3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6T/UUV5/JSEZ5KLH/F6TUUV5JSEZ5KLH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FME/RIBQ/JSEZ5KLD/FMERIBQJSEZ5KLD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAH/7QAN/JSEZ5IJ7/FAH7QANJSEZ5IJ7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVZ/7COI/JSEZ5O7B/FVZ7COIJSEZ5O7B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQR/LSG3/JSEZ2ZY6/FQRLSG3JSEZ2ZY6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8U/Z2XL/JSEZ5KIW/F8UZ2XLJSEZ5KIW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Jig Holder"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Note: some of the pictures in this step are from an earlier version and may appear a little different than the current one.\nThe rest of the work station is fairly straightforward. The base can be made from whatever you have on hand. I glued two pieces of 1/2\" plywood together, but 3/4\" plywood would work well also. For this example, the base is 12\" wide and 36\" long.\nThe jig is moved higher or lower in the pinch box to drill holes in different thicknesses of wood. For 1/2\", the bottom of the jig needs to extend below the bottom of the pinch box. A 1-1/4\" clearance hole is drilled in the base to allow this. In my case, I drilled the hole through just one piece of the 1/2\" plywood before gluing them together.\nPosition the box with the back flush with the back edge of the base and clamp in place. Drill holes for screws to firmly fix the box to the base. Don't forget that the sides have to be able to move to pinch and release the jig - only use screws at the back. Don't use glue.\nRip some 3/4\" plywood 3-1/2\" wide for the front side rails. Cut them to length so that they go from the sides of the pinch box to either side of the base. You want to leave a little room for the sides of the pinch box to spread. Now you're ready to drill your first pocket holes using the work station itself!\nInsert the jig and adjust it so that the bottom is flush with the bottom of the pinch box (this is the setting for 3/4\"). Clamp the rails as shown and drill pocket holes at three places to mount them to the base. Clamp a piece of plywood or a straightedge as shown to aid in placing the rails. Glue and fasten the front side rails with pocket hole screws.\nRip more 3/4\" plywood to 3-1/8\" wide to make the back side rails. Making this 3/8\" narrower makes a \"shelf\" on which to mount the optional T-Track. Cut these to length similarly to the front pieces. They don't have to match the length of the front pieces - use what you have. Drill two pocket holes in each piece (not in the same place as the front rails).

This is to set the clamp on so that the clamping force isn't down at the bottom of the workpiece. The clamp listed (which I'm not really thrilled with) has just a bolt to press against the clamped piece. I stuck on a piece of felt made for furniture feet that I happened to have left over from another project. Adjust the bolt as far out as it will go and still feel stable. Then use a piece of 1/2\" (1/2\" is the thinnest practical material for pocket holes) scrap to place the clamp and mark the location of the mounting holes. Pre-drill the holes and mount the clamp with wood screws.\nBefore attaching the adhesive measuring tapes on top of the front rails, sand the tops of the rails smooth with 220 grit sandpaper. A coat of polyurethane will help to give the adhesive tape a smooth mounting surface. Insert the drill bit into the jig and make a mark where the tip of the bit hits the base. This is where a pocket hole will be centered. Measure 2\" from the mark on each of the front rails to show where to position the adhesive measuring tapes. I used the 2\" side of a machinist's 1-2-3 block as shown in the picture. Trim the tapes at either end.\nT-Track might be a bit over the top, but it is handy for stop block(s) if you want to drill a number of like pieces. Cut a piece of T-Track to fit each back rail. Carefully pre-drill the mounting holes and screw in place. You could go all out and get a flip-over stop for the T-Track, but I just made a simple one out of plywood scraps as seen in the picture.\nFinally, I had an old 1-1/4\" shop vacuum hose that I had replaced with a 2-1/2\" one.

You could do this by opening a fixture such as a faucet at the lowest point in the house and this will ensure that there\u2019s no pressurized water inside the pipes when cutting into them. If you\u2019re working in the basement like I am for example, you could drill a small hole where your new fittings will be to allow for most of the water to come out seeing you\u2019re at a lower point.\nWhen there\u2019s no more water coming out the pipe, use the fitting to mark where the cut needs to be made and make the cut. I find that using this type of pipe cutter is so much easier than these as they tend to snag on everything, especially in confined spaces like this. What\u2019s cool about them is you could get a ratcheting handle to make the job a whole lot easier without sacrificing space. There\u2019s gonna be some water left inside the pipe. Now if you can\u2019t get your recipient to fit to catch the water, here\u2019s a cool little trick. Get some aluminum foil and use it to divert the remaining water from the pipe into your recipient, you won\u2019t have any water to pick up like this.

Like I said in the beginning of the video, I\u2019d do a side by side comparison of both normal flux and tinning flux. As you could see, the tinning flux will give you a better chance of getting full coverage because of the solder powder that\u2019s in it. In any case, make sure you are getting a lead-free flux, as some do contain lead which is unwanted for potable water lines. I\u2019ll be using some tinning flux for this demonstration.\nYou need to apply some to both the pipe and the fitting to make sure all the surfaces are properly covered. A big mistake that a lot of beginners make is applying too much flux, only a thin layer is needed and the reason being is that a lot of it is lost inside the pipes when it\u2019s heated and if left there for a while it could eat up the pipe and eventually lead to problems.

As you probably noticed, the joint we need to solder is pretty close the wooden stud so we\u2019ll need to use some precautions.\nIf you got one of these flame protectors, get two thumb tacks and place it around the pipe in a way that anything flammable is protected.

There are 3 things to know at this stage, 1, what to heat, 2 how long to heat and 3, how much solder to use. I like using a low heat for everything in tight spots, starting with the pipe first. The reason why I do it this way, is the fact the between the fitting and pipe is a small gap, and heating the fitting can\u2019t conduct the heat to the pipe properly because of this, so I always heat it up for a couple of seconds prior to heating the fitting. The amount of time you need to spend heating depends on the size pipes you are working with, meaning a \u00bd\u201d pipe will take less long to heat than a \u00be\u201d pipe. The best way to know when to apply your solder is to try it out every now and then, when it gets sucked in, that\u2019s when it\u2019s hot enough. However, you don\u2019t want to wait too long as the flux\u2019ll burn off and you\u2019ll need to restart everything. And for the amount of solder to use it\u2019s easy to know, just use a \u00bd\u201d of solder for \u00bd\u201d pipes and \u00be\u201d of solder for \u00be\u201d pipes. You don\u2019t wanna use more than that, or it\u2019ll end up in the pipe and could cause a restriction, greatly reducing flow.

This is used because it's a good flat surface to work from. Be sure to not get glue on this surface while building the rest.

These were also evenly spaced but, offset slightly to allow for every other row to be slightly off line with the previous row. This allowed for easy access to brad nail the pieces in. I also used a spacer block to align each piece as it went in. This ensured that it was evenly spaced and square.\nNext, the 3/4\" top skin is glued and brad nailed to the grid pattern.

My original hole saw drill I made with an old hole saw that I ground the teeth off of and wrapped it with a single layer of 0.040\" copper sheet. That worked really well and you can see a picture of it on the previous slide.\nThe next hole saw is made using a 3/4\" copper cap. I drilled the center hole with a lathe but if you are careful you should be able to do it with just a drill press. I made the shaft with a 1/4\" bolt, nut and washer. If I did it again I would have used a lock washer and a nylon lock nut because the bolt came loose a couple of times when I was drilling.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVI/LS41/JSEZ61FT/FVILS41JSEZ61FT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIR/Z25W/JSEZ61BO/FIRZ25WJSEZ61BO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWS/RLI3/JSEZ61HF/FWSRLI3JSEZ61HF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVZ/YB2M/JSEZ61MK/FVZYB2MJSEZ61MK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSP/GW5J/JSEZ61P4/FSPGW5JJSEZ61P4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8E/2WLJ/JSEZ61UU/F8E2WLJJSEZ61UU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Make Your Drill"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "To drill the holes you will need to make a dam of modeling clay to hold the grinding compound and water around the drill.

I wanted the uprights to be solid wood, with minimal finishing (simply oil or clear polyurethane), and the shelves painted gray.\nThe bottom shelf is the same color as the other shelves, but much heavier, in order to lower the center of gravity. I therefore used concrete to make the bottom shelf. This makes the lamp rather stable.

The height should be approx. 6\". I created a little alcove under the base, with the idea to place a wifi switch inside, but I then decided not to. The concrete block can be a simple rectangular shape.\nBuild the mold using cheap panels, like melamine. Keep in mind that you will have to be able to easily take it apart, but it should still be sturdy enough to shake it with a hammer. Then run a bead of caulk around the edges, and let it dry. Lastly, mix your concrete with water as directed on the bag, and quickly pour it in the mold and shake it.\nOnce dried, remove the mold, and let it dry a week. You can sand any rough edges with a light grit sander, and fill the holes with epoxy. Then paint it with the color you want, drill 1/2\" diameter holes in each corner, where the center of the uprights will be. Place a threaded rod in each hole, and lock them with epoxy. Make sure that they stay perfectly straight, and are centered!\nLesson learned:\nMake sure that the mold base is level. The cement surface will be level, so if the base is not level, the whole lamp will be leaning like the tower of Pisa. If you made the same mistake as I did, you can correct this later with some shims under the concrete block.\nTip:\nShake well the cement after you poured it in the mold, using a hammer, or with a vibrating tool. And when you think that you shook it enough, shake it some more.

Look at the 4 holes (well 8, if you look at the top and the 'shelf'). Those 4 holes are not going to give us an accurate reading unless we can perfectly center the item we're measuring, which defeats the idea of not having to find the center of the blade. But even if you could find the center every time, there are other mechanical limitations that the springs and even the screw posts have. So what we'll need to do next is create something that will only allow the 'shelf' to extend upwards in a straight path. Enter the glorious over sized Tenon and his beautiful wife, The Mortise. (Please, no connotations here, this is a 'G' platform after all).\nI used a piece of padauk and cut it down on the table saw.

Be sure that you only mark on the piece that you glued on, and not the perpendicular piece attached. I've made a sketchup picture showing exactly what I mean. In the middle, where both lines intersect, take something sharp and puncture it. That's where we'll be drilling next with the drill press.\nThis is where the 1/16\" drill bit comes in. We're going to drill a hole right where that 'X' comes together, but it's only going to be a reference point. After the hole has been drilled, we'll flip the half box over and lay it face down on a scrap of wood. We'll grab our 7/8\" Forestner bit and we'll place the point in the freshly drilled 1/16\" hole. Just a tip, slowing down your drill press is much safer on your project when using large Forestner bits.\nAfter we have a beautifully carved out hole, we'll use our file to square it into a nice mortise. You may have noticed in the video that I used a coping saw, but it is not necessary and could lead to a mistake that might ruin your project, so use it at your own risk. Constantly take the tenon you cut out in the last step and check it to the opening until you're sure you have a perfect fit. A perfect fit is C R I T I C A L!\nNote: Remember, again, that you will be working with a tenon that is a rectangle. After we add a ruler to it, it'll be a nice even square.

Now it's time to make it square. We'll first start off by placing the tenon through the mortise and placing the 'shelf' on the underside of the half box (you have to love all my fancy made up words). We'll do this so that we can run a pencil across the tenon, above the box. We'll cut off the excess and sand until the top of the tenon sits flush with the half box. Perfectly flush.\nNext we'll pull out the tenon and place our ruler (General Tool\u00ae 6\" Stiff Ruler is what I used ) up next to it. We'll position the zero of the ruler to be on the end of the tenon and head to the other end of the tenon where we'll mark a line on the ruler. We'll use an angle grinder to cut off the metal excess and check to make sure that the ruler is not longer than the tenon. If it is, we'll grind the side opposite of the zero until it is slightly shorter than the tenon.\nCutting the ruler\nPhew! Let common sense be your friend on the ruler. Obviously we don't want to cut off the beginning part of the ruler as the excess. Also obvious that we don't want any part of the ruler to stick out of the top of your contraption or we'd have a bad reading when it's time to set it on a blade.\nNow that that's done, I used a steel center punch and put a couple dents about a 1/2\" from the top and bottom of the ruler. I used those to guide my step drill bit and cut up to the 5/16\" step, not going all the way through but leaving a slightly larger pilot hole where the tip of the #8 screw will sit slightly below the metal ruler. We don't want that screw to rub as it passes through the mortise.\nPiloting the screw holes\nFinally, in this step, we'll attach the ruler we cut against the 13/16\" side. We'll move the zero of the ruler flush with the end of the tenon, find the center of the holes we just drilled in the metal, and mark the center with an awl. We'll use an 1/8\" drill bit to drill a pilot hole and drive the screws in, very carefully, maybe even with a screw driver (of all things!). Be sure the zero edge of the ruler is flush with the end of the tenon before cinching the metal tight against the tenon.\nCheck to make sure it fits and slides easily and that it's tight in the mortise, and head onto the next step.\nTenon and his new obsession: the ruler", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFN/C3LC/JS5C36HI/FFNC3LCJS5C36HI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F39/RNY8/JS5C36HM/F39RNY8JS5C36HM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0O/GKE7/JS5C36I4/F0OGKE7JS5C36I4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCN/G840/JS5C36IB/FCNG840JS5C36IB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRF/PRUY/JS5C36M0/FRFPRUYJS5C36M0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7H/JP54/JS5C36N1/F7HJP54JS5C36N1.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Tenon and Measuring Stick"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "That's right, before we make the connection between the 'shelf' and the tenon permanent with wood glue, we'll put a pilot hole through the 'shelf' and the tenon.

I used harry in the last step, but maybe tricky is a better word. Problematic? Thorny? Let's stick with harry.\nIn this step, you'll have to figure out the depth that the aluminum posts will need to have for the included screw to be tight without the 'shelf' being drawn up. That is, you'll have to make sure that the shelf stays flush with the bottom of the half box. This means you'll have to drill a little, check it by inserting the aluminum posts through the bottom and tightening the screws on top. Oh, and the bottom has to remain flush (deeper than flush is probably better), or, again, it'll be inaccurate.\nOn the 'shelf' I used a countersink bit that was larger than the head of the aluminum post. I sank the bit pretty low (about an 1/8\") as that was what was needed for mine. On the top, where the screws will tighten, I used a 1/2\" drill bit, being extremely careful not to drill to far down, as well as keeping it straight and free from tear out. This doesn't need to be complicated, but if you play strictly to instruction and not much to a little outside of the box logic, it might be frustrating.\nAfter you find the sweet spot where the screws are screwed in all the way and both the top and the bottom are recessed, put all four posts in and tighten the included screws (that came with the aluminum posts) in the top. Make sure the shelf is flush and the bottom heads are recessed nicely. Now flip the box over so that the bottom is up and head on over to the next step.\nTIP: Its okay to sand both broad edges (8\" length) of the 'shelf' just a hair. It will have to be able to slide easily.

With the half box still positioned upside down, we'll simply add a bit of glue to the side opposite of the zero on the tenon, slide it through the mortise (lower ruler side up), slide the shelf in and add the screw back.\nGluing...\nOnce the screw is tight and secured, we'll flip it upright. All 4 posts will be in at this stage and we'll slide 2 springs over each post. If you can find a 4\" spring with the spring dimensions I gave (maybe even a 3\" spring), use them. In my part of the world I had a very difficult time finding anything other than the 1 7/8\" spring lengths (again, be very sure you use the exact wire gauge thickness and side that I included in materials).\nThis part can be a little tricky as well, but I found it easier just to leave the 'shelf' sitting upright with all the springs up in the air, and then carefully sliding the half box on top of it. Ease the springs down until the aluminum posts protrude from the holes, and screw in your screws. Once all 4 are secure, we'll flip the half box upside down and add epoxy to the heads of the aluminum posts. We don't want to put too much in, or allow the epoxy to be anywhere in the hole. This, again, is the bottom side of the 'shelf'.

Firstly use kapton tape on all of the conductive services before you start integrating all of the components into the enclosure.

I cut out a curved section for the bottom, creating two points of floor contact for each side. For the tops, I cut out sections for the mortise, but no curve. It would be one long connection to the top. Each bottom and each top piece are two of the strips glued together. This method was an easier way for me to create the mortises.\nAs you can see, this wasn't the best looking work. They work, but needed to be cleaned up.\nAfter cutting the leg pieces to size, I shaped the bottoms to create the tenons to fit into the mortises.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQZ/JLGO/JH6JCBXM/FQZJLGOJH6JCBXM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4M/4ZFY/JH6JCBXW/F4M4ZFYJH6JCBXW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0P/6P9P/JH6JCBMA/F0P6P9PJH6JCBMA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCE/37S0/JH6JCBY5/FCE37S0JH6JCBY5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPB/6MX5/JH6JCBY7/FPB6MX5JH6JCBY7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBG/OLZ0/JH6JCBU6/FBGOLZ0JH6JCBU6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5V/ZDE7/JH6JCBXP/F5VZDE7JH6JCBXP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM4/FITU/JH6JCBBT/FM4FITUJH6JCBBT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV2/FZU2/JH6JCBG6/FV2FZU2JH6JCBG6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Legs and Base"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "After fitting the base pieces together I decided to use bolts on either side of the mortises just to add some stability and a couple of the tenons did not fit as snuggly as I would like. This was accomplished by pre drilling holes for the bolts, hammering them in, and tightening the nuts. I used lock nuts to keep them from potentially coming undone.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFT/OX1I/JH6JCB96/FFTOX1IJH6JCB96.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5D/LNH1/JH6JCBAX/F5DLNH1JH6JCBAX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMI/5I4P/JH6JCBEF/FMI5I4PJH6JCBEF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAX/G2W6/JH6JCBXZ/FAXG2W6JH6JCBXZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Putting the Base Together"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Once the base has been completed, place the top, well, on top. I cleaned up the edges with a couple passes on the circular saw. I did not attach the top to the base with fasteners, the top is heavy enough to withstand the forces I apply to it, which is just a home for my miter saw. If you plan to use this type bench for something with more directional forces, you should fasten the top to the base. This could be accomplished a few different ways (brackets, tenons, dowels, etc.) Top surface can be planed down or drilled into for bench dogs. I left this step off of my build as that was not what I was looking for with this build.\nThis was a simple build, it just took a lot of time to get everything situated. I was able to all of the work with a table saw, drill, and circular saw. If you were motivated enough, it could be completed without the table saw. If I were to do this again, I would have spent more time and resources on glueing the top pieces together. It could have benefited from a different method of securing, perhaps dowels or some other jointing techniques.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FO6/FO4Y/JH6JCBXU/FO6FO4YJH6JCBXU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ2/JUY4/JH6JCBXN/FZ2JUY4JH6JCBXN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Add the Top and Its a Workbench"}], "channel": "Workbenches"}]
