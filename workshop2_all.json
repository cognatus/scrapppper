[{"category": "Workshop", "description": "Hi there! Here is a bowl made with a bandsaw (using no lathe).\nI use left over pine wood from another project. But any wider wood board would work.\nI have a small bandsaw with a thin blade (but a scrollsaw would work even better).\nThis is the first time I make this design, and I think it turned out pretty decent. If you want there is a short video covering this build too.\nPlease let me know if you have any questions, and I will try to answer. Also consider following me here for more projects like this in the future!\nFor this build I used\n- pine board (any kind of wider solid board will work)\n- bandsaw(or scrollsaw even)\n- wood glue\n- pen\n- compass (woodworking divider?)\n- ruler\n- square\n- some clamps\n- palm sander\n- sandingpaper\n- steelwool (optional)\n- disc sander (optional)\n- spray lacquer (optional)\nThe project is pretty easy and fun to make. The time to make this is a couple of hours over a couple of days. The glue needs to set over night and it is up to you how much you need/want to sand it.\nThis is a perfect project to make if you have the urge to make a bowl, but have no lathe! :-)", "title": "Bandsaw Bowl", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Bandsaw-Bowl/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I find the center of the board by using a ruler from coner to corner - making an \"X\".

The thicker piece of wood you will need from start.\nI used a small cut off piece and placed it behind the band saw blade after cutting the base plate. The template piece must be the same thickness as the bowl. Otherwise the angle will be wrong.\nI trace a line with a pen, copying the angle of the blade.\nYou can see that in the first picture.\nThen I use a square marking the sides from the line. From the top and the bottom of the line. This will give the thickness of the next rings. The base from the last ring will sit on top of the next ring. And you do not need any calculations.

Now that the Trellis has its holes in it you can move on to working with the steel.\n\nThe first thing you want to do is draw your piece of steel bar out to a point, as shown in Picture 1. There are two ways that you could do this.\n\nThe first is through drawing it out (also known as forging a taper). Drawing out is one of the most basic techniques in blacksmithing, and it is simple enough to understand and do, but not simple to explain in writing, at least not for me. Rather than reading my confusing explanation, I would reccomend watching one of several wonderful tutorials on this available on Youtube. The following video is just one of many.\n\nYou don't have to have an anvil to do this either - a flat steel surface is all you need. You could use a piece of railroad track, a section of I-beam, a sledgehammer head fixed into a lump of concrete, or even a simple piece of steel block bought from a junkyard. Pictures 2-5 are all examples of makeshift anvils. Maximillian The Ruthless has a pretty great Instructable on makeshift anvils as well (https://www.instructables.com/id/Improvised-Anvils/).\nIf you prefer not to forge out a taper, you could try the second option. This is using an angle grinder or a file to make your point. To do this, you would simply fix your bar in a vise and shape it with your tool.\n\nEither way you form your point, make sure to round out all of the sharp angles when you're finished up. From the point where the bar begins to narrow to the tip it should be rounded.

Once it's an orange colour quench the crook but not the taper (Picture 4). Quenching the crook will remove the flexibility that comes with heat, ensuring that the crook won't deform as you tap the taper into a more elegant shape.\n\nHold your hammer very close to the head (Picture 4). As a general rule, the closer your hand is to the hammerhead the more control you'll have over where your blow lands, and during this step control is very important.\n\nAs you tap the taper with the hammer, a more aesthetic curl should begin to form. Lean into the direction that the taper was already curling and you should be able to get a nice shape with few problems (Picture 5).
