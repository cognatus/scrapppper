To do this I used a 2-\u215b\u201d hole saw and make sure you put a piece of wood under the piece you are cutting, that way there will be no tear out from the hole saw. Once the inside part was cut out, I then drilled out the place for the eye of the hippo. After those two things were done, then I used a jigsaw to cut out the shape. I went along the outside of the line. I would later go back in and sand to the line. I found that clamping the board to something made it a lot easier to cut with the jigsaw.

You're dead to me private taco!!!\n\nPerhaps this means I'm out of touch - or just a savage, somehow still existing in this modern era of taco cradledom. Surely, I have a bit of a defense due to the existence of the TACOsaurus Rex Taco Holder, which is a throwback to the late Cretaceous Period. Scientific data tells us that tacos were of course the snack of choice during that era, but I digress.\n\nIt's is my opinion that while taco holding may be an admirable cause, we need more instances of tacos doing the actual holding - it's about time they give back to society!\n\nLadies and gentlemen, children of all ages, fellow taco lovers ... the journey starts with smartphones ... a taco to hold a smartphone.", "title": "The Taco Phone Holder", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Taco-Phone-Holder/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I started with the internal box, because it will establish the scale and therefore determine the dimensions of the taco shell.

It was in that spirit that I decided to use some cut-offs to make a bench for the entryway to my house.\nI had cut down a large live edge black walnut slab in the past (see my other instructables) to make a table and had some long, rectangular-ish pieces left over. While I could have cut them down for uses in smaller projects, I decided that it would be a crime to ruin them. Since I needed a bench anyway, I thought this would be a great use for at least one of them.\nDesign\nIf you get into chair and stool making you will quickly realize how complicated things can get. You need to worry about the height, rake and splay, joinery, etc. I made an effort to keep my design as simple as possible. I would have circular through mortises in the bench top that the bench legs would fit into. The legs themselves would be made from a blond curly maple that would contrast nicely with the walnut. For added strength and style points I would cut the leg tops so I could hammer black walnut splines down into them. I decided to pass on adding a stretcher since this bench would be quite heavy and the tenon portion of each leg was about 3 inches long. This meant it would be a pretty robust configuration.\nIn all honesty, this is a pretty easy build. Don't worry if you don't have a lathe (neither do I), I will show you how to make nice round bench legs by hand! (Yay! Not really, its a ton of work haha)\nMaterials:\n- Black Walnut Cast Off (approximately 3 ft long, 16 inches wide, 3 inches thick)\n- Curly Maple Beam (about 4\" x 5\"x10')\nTools:\nTable Saw (Get an awesome old one off craigslist, best way to go!)\nChop Saw\nBand Saw\nAngle Grinder\nAngle Grinder Flap Discs\nOrbital Sander\nAssorted Sanding Papers\nHand Plane\nDraw Knife (I picked mine up at an estate sale but this is similar - https://amzn.to/2se5hbP)\nSpoke Shave\nTiteBond III\nTung Oil\nSome Type of Ventilator Mask\nLint Free Rags\nWork Bench with a Vise\nCheck out my tool review at https://www.triplecitiescraftsman.com/tool-review...", "title": "Black Walnut and Curly Maple Live Edge Bench", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Black-Walnut-and-Curly-Maple-Live-Edge-Bench/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Lets start with the bench top.\nLuckily this slab was already pretty flat, so I just had to fine tune things with my hand plane. The bench dogs on my workbench came in very handy as they allow me to constantly readjust the slab to work on the areas I want while holding it in place.\nOnce I had flattened things out to my liking, I made some reference lines and found the approximate center of the slab. From there I marked out where I wanted my legs to project through the top. I played around with angles in a 3D mockup in Fusion 360 and settled on making the legs 10 degrees off of the vertical axis.\nDrilling things at a fixed angle by hand is a fairly challenging process. I took a scrap piece of wood and used my compound drill press to drill a hole that was the same angle (10 degrees) I was looking for. I then clamped this piece to the top of the slab and used it as a guide for my drill bit. All in all it worked pretty well, I would say around 90% happy with it haha. A forstner bit is not the best to be using for something like this, an augur bit would have been a better choice.\nWith the holes drilled you should how have your top mostly done.\nI used an angle grinder with a flap disc to clean up the cracked and the live edge.

The Bench Legs.\nI do not have the disposable income to buy a lathe at the moment so I had to resort to more primitive methods of making cylindrical objects. I might make an instructable just on this step but for now here is the summary of how I did this.\n1) Rough cut your legs out of your stock. I cut my beam of maple down and then used the table saw and jointer to get myself 4 sticks 2.5\" x 2.5\" x 30\". I then used the band saw and by tilting the table at a 45 degree angle was able to cut the corners off of the sticks, turning them into octogons.\n2) Drill a hole of the diameter you want the top of your legs to be (1.5\" for me) in a piece of scrap.\n3) Use a ruler to find the center on the end of each stick. Since I want my ends to be 1.5\" I then marked out 0.75\" away from the center mark in a few different spots.\n4) Hold the scrap piece with the 1.5\" diameter hole over the end of the maple stick and line the edges up with the marks you just made. Use a pencil to trace the circle onto the end. You now have a guide for when you are working the legs.\n5) Clamp the stick in the front vise and, using your drawknife, start removing material, tapering the leg down to the 1.5\" diameter circle you marked out.\nNOTE: Be careful, you can remove alot of material very quickly with a drawknife.\n6) Regularly rotate the leg so that you evenly remove material from all sides.\n7) Measure how long the tenon end of the leg needs to be (~3 in for me). Measure 3.25\" down from the end of the leg and make a marking. You now need to get the area inside the 3.25\" to all be a uniform 1.5\" diameter.\n8) Pick up your spokeshave. This is a little gentler than a drawknife and allows you to fine tune things. Use the spokeshave to shave away at the end of the leg until you get the entire 3.25\" to be a uniform 1.5\" in diameter (see pictures if this doesn't make sense).\n9) Shape the rest of the legs as you see fit.

Don't chew on your pencil, possible lead poisoning...\nI had purchased online a bunch of extra long golf tees (3 1/4 inch) which was delivered right before the holiday rush. You need 14 pegs or golf tees for a game board.\nI knew I wanted to use a piece of poplar wood as the faceplate with all the holes to make it a little more neater than drilling out pine. It\u2019s slightly more expensive but not as expensive as hardwoods such as oak, maple, cherry\u2026 I was going to stain/poly finish it later on so poplar is popular for woodworking.\nI used a thin 1/4 inch thick board as a face veneer for a core piece of 1 x 6 pine(which is actually 3/4 inch by 5 1/2 inch when milled down and kiln dried to a nice piece of bare lumber/timber)\nI had a piece of hardboard laying around so I will use that as the backer or bottom piece of the wood sandwich.\nI first wanted to glue and laminate the face layer with the middle core. I was going to make 6 game boards so I went with the whole board which was enough to make the 6 game boards. I clamped everything up and saw that the board had started warping unevenly at various points from the moisture it had absorbed from the glue.\nYou can never have enough clamps\u2026\nI kept an eye on it while the glue dried and not liking what I saw, I decided I could still pry apart the two pieces and redo the glue-up with cut smaller pieces so I don't end up with gaps in between the layers. Use a wet paper towel to wipe up the excess glue that squeezes out.\nSo from experience in making this\nhttps://www.instructables.com/id/My-First-Protoboa...\nI printed out a pattern or template of where the holes should be drilled. I marked them out using an awl punching a small dimple for the drill point to seat in. The wood was a bit tougher than soft pine so I went to darken in the dimples with a pencil.\nI was going to break out the drill press but i wanted to stick more to hand-tools. I set up my portable drill guide on the cordless drill. Have a spoil board or scrap piece of wood under the board you are drilling through. The holes can be drilled all the way through since we will add on a bottom stopper cover plate. Besides, depth stop collars on drills and that drill guide attachment can wander off when used.\nI selected a drill bit that allowed the golf tee to fit in and out smoothly. I used something that was a tiny bit oversized because there was not a better size in my incremental size drill bit set, maybe a metric size? I did try to sharpen my countersink bit from the last project with some diamond dust needle files. It worked marginally better to put a chamfer on the entrance of the drilled holes. I think it may be time to buy a real countersink bit.\nI cut pieces of hardboard roughly to size to be the bottom layer. You can score hardboard with a fairly deep cut or several passes of the utility knife and then snap it apart. They were then glued to the drilled board pieces. I thought the patterned texture on one side would make an interesting bottom layer face. The other side was slick so I scratched it up with a utility knife for a better gluing surface.

Find a small scrap of wood to use as a sanding block. Round off the edges to grip and use comfortably.\nThe edges on the game board were rounded for a nicer feel when handled.\nAll of this could be done production-wise by running it through a planer, jointer or router to trim and smooth the edges. The top face edges could be made fancier with a nice classic router shape.\nMake a template on where to drill mounting holes for the rounded wood plug feet.\nI needed to use a spade bit to make the 1/2 inch mounting holes for the button feet. It would be nicer to do this with a flat bottomed Forstner bit in a drill press. I did have to scrape out a few holes with the tip of a utility knife because it wasn't drilled deep enough to fit the plug as I gauged everything by eye. Fill the mounting hole with glue and glue in da feet.\nAt this point I glued on some instruction stickers I made up. I made the instruction sticker itself, not the instructions on the instruction sticker. I added the school logo to the instruction sticker to personalize it even more.\nEvenly spread a thin layer of glue on the back of the printed instructions.

The base (the shelf that all 3 pictures sat on) is 12\" long.\nBut that's not all.\nIn order for the pictures to slide in, we need to make rails. Under the strips we cut, we're going to put thinner strips in which will allow the pictures to slide in. Look at the pictures with the red circles to get a better understanding of what's being talked about in this step.\nThe thinner strips are a little over a 1/16\" wide.

The width from the bottom of the clock base to the bottom rail was about a 1/4\".\nOnce we have the rail base glued with hot glue and wood glue to the clock shape, it's time to put the perpendicular pieces on.\nWe used scrap wood blocks to space the perpendicular rails so that the rails would be easier to be placed. Because the pictures need to slide inside the rail, the block would need to be smaller than the picture we're inserting. For example, if we're using a 4x6 photo as the center picture, the width of the entire picture is going to be 6\". Because it is sliding inside of a rail, we're going to lose a 1/16\" (1/8\" in all) on both sides of the picture. That would mean that we'll need to have a scrap board that is 5 and 7/8\" wide. We'll find the center of a scrap of wood that is 5 and 7/8\" and place that center above the center of the 12\" rail base.\nIf you choose to do wallet pictures on the sides, those are about 2 1/2\" wide, so you'll need to use a scrap of wood that is 2 and 3/8\" wide.\nI know this is confusing, but it really is all about using a board that is square on both sides as something to put the rails against, making the rail gluing much easier.\nSpacing Our Rails...In 4K!\nSpace Our Rails Pt 2...Also In 4K!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLZ/VNLD/JQGYLTBW/FLZVNLDJQGYLTBW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPC/DY2D/JQGYLTFA/FPCDY2DJQGYLTFA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Attaching the Photo Rails!"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Now let's go back to using the old clock pattern we used earlier to make the clock base.

Now we'll draw the circle in by drawing half and flipping it over for the other half. Once we do that, we'll use an awl and put a center in the circle.\nUnless you have a hole saw or a forestner bit that's big enough to cut out the diameter of the hole, you're going to need to find a way to remove all that wood in the circle.

At the same time I did it along the top side of these pieces too and cut a piece for the top and cut the angle all the way around too so it would fit in when all the pieces were aligned together.\nAfter that I cut them to down to 5\" in height and started to mark for where I wanted the curved cutouts. In my drawings I started toy with some measurements before settling on 3/4\" up from the bottom and 1/2\" from each side to add the appearance of feet, to get the curve I just used a roll of tape.\nUnfortunately I don't have any photos of the process but I laser cut out the curve design on some thin 5mm MDF to use as a jig, marked up the shape on each piece then took them to the bandsaw to cut them out roughly, and used that same jig to help tidy up the edge when I went over it with a handheld router.\nOnce it was all cut to shape I started to glue up, I put the box together and put blue tape on each corner then unfolded it, this will stop the glue squeeze out, once glued I folded it back together and (although I would never recommend but it worked for me, my time constraints, and lack of equipment) I used shoelaces to keep it tightly squeezed together, wrapped around twice with each lace.

This is fine for most people but if you plan on taking your vehicle offroad a metal bumper has saved me a lot of body damage, the rear swing out was mainly to hold gear for me as my FJ came stock with a rear tire carrier but getting that tire out from under a vehicle is good for 2 reasons. (1) While a vehicle is in 4wd you really should have the same size tire on all 4 wheels. Most people I know get larger tires when they decide to build a vehicle for offroading and the spare under the vehicle doesn't get changed. (2) When someone blows out a rear tire in mud and the vehicle drops on to its frame it is a long, dangerous process to get the tire out from underneath the vehicle.\nTools used in the project.\nWelder\nAngle grinder\nProtractor\nHammer\nClamps\nChop saw\nSkill saw\nJigsaw\nSocket set\nClamps, lots of clamps", "title": "How to Build a Rear Bumper With Swing Out.", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Build-a-Rear-Bumper-With-Swing-Out/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The what\nYou want to build a bumper to protect your vehicle and to carry stuff not on my roof rack or inside the cab.\nThe why\n(I know its out of order but it sounds better as a title)\nI want to protect the vehicle is an easy one.

I also don't want to store extra gas up on the roof or inside the cab and occasionally it would be nice to have some recovery gear and maybe some drinks outside the vehicle so I don't have to dig in it all the time to get anything.\nThe how\nThe bumper can protect the vehicle, I also want it to wrap a bit around the sides so if I slide into anything it hits it instead of the body. The tire can go on a tire carrier and I can make a gas can holder kinda like a shelf so I can put a cooler there if I don't need gas.\nThe plan\nAsk yourself these questions and it will help direct you to your plan. In my case, at first, all I wanted was bumper the swingout came later, about 4 months later.\nThe bumper needs to be strong enough to take a hit on something, it won't save you from a 40 mile an hour crash but backing into a tree or falling onto a rock it should do fine. This needs to anchor onto the frame of your vehicle. You also need to choose what part of the vehicle gets cut off to make room for this bumper. Adding a swingout adds a lot of stress to a bumper that makes you need to anchor the bumper on both the top and bottom of the frame.\nMy plan for this project was a simple sketch with some ideas written on it to keep me on track. The idea was to have a very simple exoskeleton type bumper. I opted to use square tube because that is what I had on hand as left over from my trailer build the year before.

Take off the scrap and mark a line square to the metal at the end of the line you marked with the scrap. This is your new baseline. Take your protractor to find the angle of your original line, half the angle and use the protractor or angle finder to give you your new cut lines on either side of the new line.

The arm, the tire holder and the equipment holder.\nThe arm design\nI wanted the arm to be strong but not huge and I commonly enter the rear of the FJ so I wanted a simple latch to allow me to quickly open and close the arm. I'm saying this because a lot of \"kits\" out there have a threaded bolt closing the swing out, it's strong but not fast.\nThe arm itself is 2\" square tube like I said earlier, I put a small upwards bow on the arm because as it takes weight it will sag. Metal is strong but all metal bows. This was done by cutting a slit in the metal like I did with the bumper and rewelding it so there is a slight upwards track to the arm.\nI tested it the only way I thought reasonable to do. I sat on the arm 90 degrees out from the vehicle, the weakest the arm can be. I don't recommend this as I nearly died on that swing out arm since there were no stops and it had fresh bearings in it. You can see even with my 220 lbs it bowed the bumper down. This was partially because at the time of the test I didn't have the bumper fully reinforced.\nThe latch\nThe toggle is a locking toggle I ordered from McMaster-Carr. Its mounted on an angle to the receiver. This is done so the arm is pulled in both directions into the holder locking it into position. Both the receiver and the arm have a 1/8\" thick stainless steel plate lining them since paint would constantly be worn off. Others have used plastic here and plastic is quieter. It was simpler for me to weld on a strip on either side. Much later I put a ramp on the receiver side of the latch to allow the bumper ride up into the closed position.\nThe assist\nYou don't want this arm singing all the way out and knocking out a tail light likewise you don't want it closing on you. Both of these can cause vehicle damage or bodily harm. Many people choose to use a drop in a pin to lock the swing arm open and have a mechanical stop to keep the swing arm from going too far. I chose to use a gas strut. I chose a 240 lb gas strut to hold my arm open, I chose this much as it can hold my arm open on if I am on a 30 degree angle, also with the leverage of a 5 foot long arm it takes around 40 pounds of force to close the door, it is not a small amount but its easily done.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F51/3VD1/JLWKTNGQ/F513VD1JLWKTNGQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVC/A0DP/JLWKTNGP/FVCA0DPJLWKTNGP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVT/EBOX/JLWKTNGR/FVTEBOXJLWKTNGR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5O/MQ4R/JLWKTNGN/F5OMQ4RJLWKTNGN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5A/M0X2/JLWKTNGS/F5AM0X2JLWKTNGS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH9/SHV1/JLWKTNGM/FH9SHV1JLWKTNGM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF4/UXJ3/JLWKTNGJ/FF4UXJ3JLWKTNGJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F64/LQNC/JLWKTNGF/F64LQNCJLWKTNGF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQP/V462/JLWKTNGH/FQPV462JLWKTNGH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRO/C9NZ/JLWKTNGG/FROC9NZJLWKTNGG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAI/2M7R/JLWKTNGI/FAI2M7RJLWKTNGI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 13: The Swing Arm"}, {"step": 14, "steps_text": "The swing out is designed to hold a tire and either jerry cans or a cooler now time to design those parts.\nTire carrier\nThe tire needed to be positioned as far over to the driver's side as possible to allow room for the can/cooler mount.

The can/cooler will not always be in position.\nThe carrier itself was a simple 2\" square tube that mounted up to 2 1/2\" square tube. The 2 1/2\" square tube was carved out so it would slide over the 2\" tube so I could get an angle I wanted and a significant amount of welding around the joint.

With my experience using epoxy it was inevitable that it would be a an epoxy hybrid cue. This is going to be a custom butt section for the cue. Modern cues simply have to much technology and research at an affordable price to make it a viable decision not to use a manufactured shaft. I went with an OB +1 shaft with that accepts a 3/8 by 10 thread joint pin. This was a blast to build and had a few different obstacles that made working on a wood lathe a bit of a challenge.Some of the materials I used can be interchanged such as wood species and epoxy color. Also before building you own cue be sure to plan out the build. There are many different types of cue hardware and if you are using a shaft that is pre-manufactured make sure to check with the manufacturer to ensure you get the correct hardware. Joint pins come in a few different sizes, shapes, threads and designs. Also some higher end shafts might use proprietary joint systems. This could make it necessary to order the joint hardware directly from the shaft manufacturer. Below I will link the materials and tools I used. Leave a comment with any questions or to let me know what you guys think of the cue.\nMaterial , Hardware, Tools:\nBlack Walnut,Total Boat Epoxy , Kp Pigment (Shakira Red Pigment) ,3/4 inch Plywood (for mold) ,Poplar Wood Dowel ,Packing Tape, 4 Jaw Chuck , Stick Fast CA Glue , Drill Chuck\nSandpaper 80- 1500 grit , Wood Lathe Steady Rest\nMicro Mesh Pads, Spur drive , Turners Polish , Live Center , Jet Wood Lathe, Lathe Chisel , 3/8 by 10 Thread Tap, .34 oz HEADLESS WEIGHT BOLTS , 8mm 1.5 Thread Tap , TOP PLUG BUMPER ,Various Drill Bits, 3/8 by 10 Thread Joint Pin, BLACK LINEN JOINTCAP , BLACK LINEN BUTTCAP", "title": "How to Make a Custom Hybrid Epoxy Pool Cue Using a Wood Lathe", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Custom-Hybrid-Epoxy-Pool-Cue-Using-a/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The walnut I was using was originally intended to be used as firewood and was stored where it was not on the ground so moisture was not a problem.

The slivers of the walnut in the case needed to be small enough to fit down into the mold around the poplar wood shaft that was suspended in the center of the mold. You do not have to use this technique or this wood species. Different woods and different techniques will give the cue a much different look. The technique I am using on this particular cue gives a very random style pattern and is a great technique to use to have a truly one of a kind design. I also used only heart wood and kept that in mind while splitting the wood so i was not doing any unnecessary work. If using this technique make sure to split the pieces into small enough segments to be broken by hand as that will come in handy later on.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FF9/1MBT/JQCOFV07/FF91MBTJQCOFV07.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Splitting the Walnut"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The mold for this custom cue is made from 3/4 inch plywood it was designed to suspend a poplar shaft directly into the center of what would become a 1 3/4 inch square blank. The reason for the poplar dowel is two fold. First this will give a solid wood core to install the joint pin and also the weight bolt threads into. Secondly the shaft is designed to help reduce the vibrations felt by the shooter. This will give the cue a crisp feel to the shot making the cue preform better. The ends of the mold were marked with score lines to allow me to know the minimum fill line of the mold. This would ensure that I would have enough material to trim off the excess from the top of the blank and still attain the proper sized. While assembling the mold make sure to line all of the interior surfaces of the mold in packing tape. After lining the interior surfaces use hot glue or silicone to seal all joints including the ends where the dowel is protruding. This makes removing the blank from the mold much easier. Due to the design needed for the mold it was a tad bit oversize to fit into the custom pressure vessel that had to be built for this build. More about the pressure vessel later thought.

Simply use a google converter to convert the board feet to liters then liters to ounces. While the wood and dowel will slightly reduce the amount of epoxy you will need from the total of the equation above be mindful not to reduce the amount to much or you will run out mid pour and have to mix more. This can be a issue if you are using custom mixed colors. Be sure to use proper ratios of hardener to resin as well as mix the epoxy thoroughly. Improper ratio and not properly mixing the can both cause the epoxy improperly harden or not harden at all. If this were to happen you would have to start completely over.

The joint cap is a plastic or metal cap added at the joint to add strength and rigidity to the joint of the cue. While there a few different designs that you can order I went with a simple joint cap design that is installed onto a tenon and epoxied into place. The first step to installing the joint cap is to measure the length of the joint cap and mark that length on the cue. This is the mark that will indicate where to stop cutting on the blank so that the cap fits flush against the end of the cue blank. Next set a caliper to the widest diameter of the inside of the joint cap. This will be your guide to how much material to remove. Work slowly from the end of the cue to the mark made previously on the blank removing small amounts of material at a time and checking often until the calipers will fit tightly over the remaining tenon. Once you have reached this point test fit the joint collar. If the collar does not fit remove extremely small amounts of material and test fit again. Repeat this process until the joint cap fits snugly all the way down to the line marked previously on the cue. The joint cap should have little to no movement on the tenon. Now that the joint cap is properly fit mix up a small amount of epoxy and apply it onto the tenon and into the opening on the joint cap.

If the joint pin is mis-aligned it will cause all kinds of problems. Causing the cue to preform poorly or even seem warped. Using a self centering pin helps with this but take your time through this process and make sure to get it right. A Steady Rest is required for this process. With the cue still aligned on the live center adjust the steady rest to securely hold the end of the cue to line up the center point marked on the cue earlier perfectly inline with the center tip of the first bit. If if does not perfectly line up readjust the steady rest to get the proper alignment. There are different size joint pins and threads but this process should be the same for all of them but will require you use the proper size bits at each stage and the proper thread tap. This step up drilling method starts with using a self centering counter sink bit in a tail stock drill chuck. From there move up in small increments until at the final size drill bit needed to properly fit the thread tap needed for your joint pin. When threading the joint pin rotate the cue by hand, working the tap into the cue slightly before backing the tap out to break the chips. Once the final tap depth is reached remove the tap and clean out the threads using compressed air. Insert the joint pin into the drill chuck to the desired depth you want protruding from the butt of the cue. Remember its better to make the visible part of the joint pin a one to one and a half threads shorter that the maximum it will enter the shaft. This will ensure the shaft will tighten down securely at the joint and not bottom out. To test fit thread the joint pin into the cue until you reach the drill chuck. If the joint pin properly fits its time to install the pin. Do this by leaving the pin mounted in the drill chuck and applying epoxy to the portion of the pin that will be threaded into the butt of the cue.

Also like with the joint pin there are many different style and designs of weight bolts each using different size, depth and threads. The bumper is the same idea in that there are many different ways the bumper can mount on. I chose to use the press in style. This style is held in by friction of a tenon made onto the bumper being pressed into a hole in the end of the cue. For this particular bumper it uses a tenon slightly larger than 3/4 of an inch. To achieve the proper fit. Start with a 3/4 inch forstner bit. Drill the depth only slightly deeper than the length of the tenon on the bumper. Once the hole is properly drilled use sand paper to remove tiny amounts of material at a time until the bumper fit tightly into the hole.

Applying CA glue and then sand starting at 600 then 800 then 1500 for three layers repeating the sanding process. On the final layer start with 1500 sanding progressively up to 12000 grit micro mesh. This gives the cue a deep finished look. For the final step use EEE- Shine tuners polish to polish the finish to a high gloss finish. Apply the wax with the lathe off and spread evenly. Turn on the lathe to a medium high speed and apply light pressure until the haze of the wax is spread evenly. Turn up the speed of the lathe slightly and apply a little more pressure.

I traced that line on the inside of the box, and used that line to make the inset part of the lid.\nI put on a dado stack on my tablesaw and then cut away all around the top to match where those lines were. This would allow the lid to sit down inside the box a little bit.\nThen, I had to clean it up just a bit with a chisel and some sanding. The box lid had warped a little bit since I milled it down, so the dado stack took a few uneven passes. Nothing a few chisel passes couldn\u2019t clear up!\nThe box top was still a little bit larger than it needed to be. I wanted the sides to protrude out, but not as much as it was. It already had the recess that would fit down inside the box, so I turned it upside down and traced the outside of the box. Then, I could use this line and a ruler to determine a distance all around the lid that I could trim off to make it even.\nOff camera, I used a flush trim bit in my router to trim the bottom of the box flush with the box sides. Then, TONS of sanding.\nSide note: if you want to follow along with projects while in progress and get some behind the scenes interaction, follow me over on Instagram @Brudaddy.\nI used the tablesaw to cut a small rabbet on the outside of the box.

The voltage rating is important for designing the battery bank. If your camera operates on 12 VDC you would require a 12V Battery. If your camera operates on 24 VDC you would require a 24V Battery.\nI am using the Reolink RLC-410W WiFi Camera, I noted down the power and voltage rating from the specification sheet.

Whereas the Li-Ion battery can be charged fast, are lightweight compared to their storage capacity. They also have a long lifespan averaging 5 to 9 years. However, these benefits come at a high cost of up to 20 times the cost of a deep cycle battery.\nSizing the Battery:\nThe entire power required to run the Security Camera is drawn from the Battery Pack. So make sure the solar batteries are capable of recharging fast and store enough power for continuously monitoring & recording.\nExample:\nThe power rating of the camera = 6Watt\nWatt-Hour required to run the whole day (24hrs) = 6W x 24 hrs = 144 Wh\nBattery voltage = 12V\nWatts \u00f7 Volts = Amps\nBattery Capacity Required = 144 / 12= 12Ah\nIt is a good practice to operate the battery at 50% of its cycle. This will help to extend the lifespan of the batteries.\nMultiplying the Amp-Hour by 2 ensures that you are operating on the top 50% of the Battery\u2019s cycle, giving you 50% of its capacity remains available for future use.\nSo we need a Battery of 12 x 2 = 24Ah\nBattery Rating: 12V / 24Ah\nNote: When calculating your battery size, consider how many cloudy days you may have in a row.

The first step for sizing the solar panel is to identify the average peak sun hours in your area receives.\nThe average daily sun hours (solar insolation) in units of kWh/m2 per day is sometimes referred to as \"peak sun hours\" too. The term \"peak sun hours\" refers to the solar insolation which a particular location would receive if the sun were shining at its maximum value for a certain number of hours.\nTo find out the amount of solar insolation in your area, you can use the Global Solar Atlas.\nFor example,\nAs per the Global Solar Atlas, New Delhi, India receives 5.104 kWh/m2 per day (GTI)\nPeak Solar Radiation = 1 kW/m2 ( Solar Panels are rated at an input rating of 1kW/m2.)\nPeak Sun Hours = 5.1/1 = 5.1 Hours\nTo adequately charge your Battery you have to use a Solar Panel with equal or greater Voltage output.\nAs we have selected 12V battery system, so we have to use 12V Solar panel too. Here you should not confuse with the 12V. I wrote 12V as it is suitable for charging the 12V battery. But actually, the Solar panel voltage is around 17V or more.\nSolar Panel Rating = Battery Watt-Hour / Peak Sun Hour = 288 / 5.1 = 56.47 Watt\nWhere Battery Watt-Hour = Battery Capacity in Ah x Battery Voltage = 24Ah x 12V = 288Wh\nYou will not get the rated power at the battery terminal, because of the various losses associated in the system. Taking losses into consideration, we have to add some margin in the sizing. Roughly 30% margin is Ok.\nThe rating of the panel shall be 56.47 x 1.3 =73.4 W\nSo we need a Solar panel of rating more than 73.4 W\nSolar Panel Rating: 75W /12V\n\nAlternative Way\nAs per the Global Solar Atlas PVOUT is 3.901 kWh/kWp per day.\nThis means that if we install 1 kW (1000W) solar panel, it will generate 3.901 kWh.\nWe have to charge the battery fully in single day sunlight,\nRequire Battery Capacity = 24 Ah/12V = 288 Wh\nRequired Solar Panel = 288 / 3.901 = 73.82 W\nSolar Panel Rating: 75W /12V\nimage credit: https://www.titan-energy.co.uk", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFR/IPFN/JPQU3PEA/FFRIPFNJPQU3PEA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7A/FS9D/JO8XUN3U/F7AFS9DJO8XUN3U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYQ/J4O2/JOEW5032/FYQJ4O2JOEW5032.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTI/AURW/JOEW51CN/FTIAURWJOEW51CN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Selecting the Solar Panel"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "If your Battery is the heart of your solar Security Camera, the Solar Charge Controller is the brain and ensures that your Battery is not over-charged or over discharged.\nIt is a device which is placed between a solar panel and a battery. It regulates the voltage and current coming from your solar panel. As the input voltage from the solar panel rises, the charge controller regulates the charge to the batteries preventing any overcharging.\nTo select the proper Charge Controller, you have to know the maximum output current of the solar panel and Battery Voltage. The maximum possible current that a PV panel can generate is the \u201cshort circuit current,\u201d indicated as Isc in the panel\u2019s label or specs sheet.\nNow select a charge controller with,\n1. Current Rating more than Short Circuit Current (Isc) with consideration of a safety factor ( 1.25 x 125 = 1.56 )\n2. Voltage Rating same as the battery voltage.\nSafety Factor :\n1. We use a standard factor to account for all Photovoltaic (PV) output-boosting circumstances like a sunny day with very clear snowpack. (additional light reflected off the snow). That factor is 1.25 or 125%\n2. A second de-rating factor may be required for systems in continuous operation, additional protection must be included, according to the National Electric Code (NEC), to allow for heat and equipment stress. This factor is also 1.25 or 125%.\nSo the overall safety factor is 1.25 x 1.25 = 1.56\nFor example,\nA 75W Solar panel with Short Circuit Current (Isc) of 4.54A requires 4.54A x 1.56 = 7.08A\nIn this case, 7Amp or higher rated (10A) Charge Controller would be recommended.\nSolar Charge Controller Rating: 10A/12V\n\nNote: All thethree main components must match nominal voltage throughout the system: the solar panel, the solar charge controller, and the battery bank.\nimage credit: https://www.morningstarcorp.com/\nIf you like to reduce your system cost you can make a PWM charge controller.

Though I do not recommend using the movement, they seem to be loud and unreliable.\nVintage bezel, crystal and dials are available on eBay.\nA new combination set that combines the dial bezel and crystal is a good value available for $24.95 and is available online.\nI purchase craft paint, brushes, white glue, glue sticks and Bristol board at the dollar store.

These center justified rulers were way more help during this build then they should have been with all of these round shapes.\nThe marks on either end act as guides to bring either side down to size and then I just connect the dots from there with the round shape of the head. I do the same for the hat except that it's a straight line instead of a curve. The bottom section of the body is a bit more complicated where the belt is, but for that I just turned it down to a perfect cylinder and used a straight edge along the front to measure in to the depth that gave me the diameter where the belt is.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1L/SX1W/JQCOBXJN/F1LSX1WJQCOBXJN.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOM/5SAV/JQCOBXLB/FOM5SAVJQCOBXLB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F06/GMAL/JQCOBXMZ/F06GMALJQCOBXMZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Turning the Head"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "The top section of the body was the only one that was a little different.

The top ring was thicker though to account for the slanted shape of the body, but this gave me a ridge on the inside of this body section where I glued and screwed a block of wood. This block was then used to mount the tailstock to support the piece while I turned it down to size.\nNow the arms and legs were slightly easier, because I could just turn them as one solid piece given that the tool rest can fit underneath the smaller diameter pieces. Plus for these I can use my calipers to measure out the diameter along many locations of the cylinder. It's mounted to the lathe with just a screw chuck into one side and then pinch up with the tailstock. So to turn this down to size I use my drawing to measure the diameter, transfer that to the piece by setting my calipers and turning down that section of the arm/leg until is matches that diameter and then work my way from one side to the other side of the arm/leg.

I determine along the top where the mouth should go and then transfer those lines down the side of the body so I can cut out the center section.\nAnd then I just slow and steady cut down that line with a trusty old handsaw. There really wasn't a better tool for the job, this allowed me to cut a straight line down but also to span the gap from one side to the other to make sure I was cutting in a straight line that way.

I predrill some holes and then apply glue and screw the two pieces together using 8\" long ledger screws that are usually used to hold decks on houses...

I used a $10 iron for a few years before making the switch, and it makes soldering so much easier, cleaner, and more effective.\n> The sandpaper linked with the finishing sander (3M Pro Grade) is more expensive, but worlds better than cheap sandpaper in terms of durability and clogging. Once you try it, you'll never go back to the cheap stuff.\n> There is much cheaper epoxy resin available. The main downside is that it will significantly change from clear to a cloudy yellow over time. The more expensive brands are worth it if you want this to last.\n> The most common places to source AC transformers inexpensively are from neon sign controllers and microwaves.

Mix the two parts (epoxy and hardener) in a disposable cup. This is typically a 1:1 mix by volume, by not always. Read the instructions on your resin to make sure.\n4. Stir the resin mixture really well. About 6 minutes stirring by hand is a good guideline to follow.\n5. Add a little bit of pigment at a time and mix it in.

You don't want to get it in your lungs as there are many known health effects. Some resin particles can be carcinogenic. I highly, highly recommend wearing the full-face respirator and filters linked in the Tools section.\nSanding\nAfter the resin cures, you'll have a nice thick crust of hard resin. We have to do two things: remove the excess, then sand the surface smooth.\n1. Start with the belt sander and 80 grit sandpaper to quickly remove excess resin. Be careful of the rapid material removal, as you don't want to sand away your nice lichtenberg figures.\n2. Move on to 80 grit with the finishing sander. This will likely be the longest sanding step. It's crucial to remove all sanding marks from the belt sander at this step. Don't worry that the resin will be opaque at this point.\n3. Progress through 120, 150, 220, 320, and 400 grit sandpaper with the finishing sander.\n4. At each grit above 150, vacuum/wipe off any dust, apply clean water to all the wood surfaces, then let it dry. Repeat the same grit before moving on to the next one. This \"water popping\" raises the grain of the wood and results in a smoother finished surface.\nFinishing\n1. Decide on a finish. You generally get what you pay for here. The two linked finishes in the Materials section are expensive, but give a fantastic looking, durable oil finish with minimal work.\n2. Apply the finish to the raw wood and resin. How you apply finish will depend on which finish you use.\n3.

I\u2019ve also been 3D printing for about four years, and while printing toys and figures is fun, I am always looking for ways to make practical use of my 3D printer. After a little inspiration from the Internet, I decided to make these fun custom hexagon shelves from some 1\u201d x 8\u201d pine and 3D printed parts. My favorite part about this design is that you can create any hexagonal pattern you want to fit your needs and your space.\nLet's get started!", "title": "Custom Hexagon Shelves Using 3D Printing", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Custom-Hexagon-Shelves-Using-3D-Printing/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The first step is to plan out the pattern you want to build so you can determine exactly what your material needs will be. You can create whatever pattern you want with whatever board length you want - the flexibility of this design is fantastic! In my case, I started with the space the shelf needed to fit in, which was about 28\" tall, and making a hand-drawn picture of my design.\nTo determine the length of each board I needed, I had to do a little math. I looked at the tallest portion of my design, the two hexes on the sides. Starting from 28\", I subtracted 2.25\" for the three horizontal layers of wood, that left me with 25.75\" for the hexagons. I had two hexagons stacked , so each one was 12.875\" tall. If you know the distance from the center of the hexagon to the edge, this handy calculator will tell you the side length you want. Under \"Choose a Regular Polygon\", select Hexagon, then under \"Choose a Calculation\" select \"Find a, R, A, P | Given inradius r\". The inradius is the height of the hexagon divided by 2, then look for the value of \"a\" in the results. I rounded to my inradius to 6.5\" for my design to get a side length of 7.5\". You can see my results at this link.\nAs you plan your design, remember you need a connector for the front and back of each intersection, so count the number of two-board intersections and the number of three-board intersections, then double those numbers to determine how many of each connector you need. For my design, I needed:\n24 boards\n24 double connectors\n16 triple connectors\nLater on, I decided to model the entire thing in Autodesk Inventor to make sure everything would go together the way I expected it to.

You can use any 1\u201d-thick wood you like, but you may need to do a lot of sanding to clean everything up. For my build, 24 boards for the sides at 7.5\" each meant I needed 180\" of board, plus a few inches of waste from the kerf of the blade. Make sure you plan for the kerf - you'll be making a lot of cuts, and for my build, it added up to about 3\" of lost wood.\n\nTools:\nMiter saw - Any saw would work as long as the cuts are square and straight\nSandpaper\nOrbital sander - This is optional, but saves a lot of time.\n3D printer\nDrill\nScrewdriver\n1/16\u201d drill bit for pilot holes - This self-centering drill bit worked perfectly!\nIf you don't have a 3D printer, you could use a print and ship website like 3dHubs or printathing.com.

Consistency is absolutely essential here, and depending on your design, you may have a lot of cuts to make. If your boards vary in length more than 1/8\" or so, your final assembly may not come together correctly. I took the time to make some practice cuts on scrap lumber to make sure I was happy with my setup, and the extra time really paid off in the final product!\nThe best way to quickly get consistent cuts is to use a stop block with your miter saw. My saw came with a small arm that I used to clamp a scrap piece of 2\"x4\" in place, but you could also use double-stick tape on a piece of scrap wood or a piece of masking tape stuck to the fence of your saw. To set your stop block, bring the blade of the saw down - with the saw unplugged - and measure the distance from the saw teeth to your target length, then use that measurement to set your stop block in place.\nThe stop block was also essential because my miter saw only has a 10\" blade, which isn't enough to cut through the 1\"x8\" board I was using in one go. I had to make one cut, flip the board, and finish the cut from the other side. The stop made this process quick and painless. I did have a few boards where the cuts weren't aligned well and left an edge, but I was able to sand them down and hide the edges behind the connector pieces.\nAfter cutting all of the pieces, I sanded all of the pieces to knock down all of the edges and surfaces using 220 grit sandpaper. I did some of it by hand, then switched to an orbital sander to finish the job. In hindsight, I could have done some of the sanding before I cut the boards, which would have saved me time at this step. Also, if you wanted to stain or paint the boards for your shelf, this would be the time to do it.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FY8/RJS5/JQAU1T8Q/FY8RJS5JQAU1T8Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY7/U8G3/JQAU1T8O/FY7U8G3JQAU1T8O.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Cutting and Prepping the Wood"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "I modeled the connectors I wanted using Autodesk Inventor, which I use for my job.

I've never used either service myself, so I can't address the service or the quality of the prints.\nI was able to print two triple connectors or four double connectors at a time. My design called for 16 of the triple connectors and 24 of the double connectors, which used a total of about 1 kg of filament and about 45 hours of print time.

The connectors slid into place with a solid friction fit, so I basically just had to slide everything together. As you assemble everything:\nAdd one hexagon at a time by putting all of the connectors in place on one side of the boards, then lay the assembly down on that face to put the connectors on the back side.\nGet the connectors snugged up against the wood so there are no gaps between the plastic and the wood.\nBe careful not to force the 3D printed parts too hard to avoid cracking them. If the connector won't go on, sand that corner of the board a bit more then try again.\nPut any connectors with print defects on the back side of the shelf where they will be less noticeable.\nOnce I had everything assembled, I put in the wood screws. For each hole, I drilled a pilot hole using a 5/64\" self-centering drill bit to avoid splitting the wood, then drove the screws into place by hand. Be careful not to over-tighten the screws as this may cause the layers of the 3D printed parts to split - I had this happen to me on one connector. The split wasn't bad, so I took the part off, then super-glued it together using Loctite Super Glue - Ultra Gel Control. Not every super glue works on PLA plastic, but this one works with the Hatchbox filament I print with. I let the glue dry, then carefully put the connector back on and gently screwed it into place.\nAnd that's it! The shelves look great and are extremely solid. I actually probably could have skipped the screws and just used the friction fit for the parts as I won't be putting any significant weight on the shelves, but I liked how the screws looked.\nI hope you found this Instructable useful!

The electrical wire, wraps around the pole as a parasite, clamping itself tightly, suffocating the tentacle. This lamp is originally designed as a visualisation of my personal stance towards the current state of the (dutch) design field. But it would be a great piece for any occasion where you'd like to add a bit of alienation too. Lets say... Halloween or something. I would not advice this lamp for everyday use, cause this Instructable does not cover details like the body to weight ratio. If you do not have a very heavy foot. It will become top heavy very fast. So much, that the weight of a single light bulb might already be too much, and tip the whole lamp over. Be aware of this as well while bending the rod. By trying to add the end of the rod as close to the center as possible.\nThe lamp is made in 6 major steps;\nThe (structural) inner rod\nThe fabric\nThe concrete foot\nThe electrical wire\nand the assembling\nIn this Instructable I will explain every step in more detail. Explaining what all the steps were and the motivation / desired end goal of these steps. So you can tweak it to comply with your own desired outcome.\nSpecifications\nThis lamp is about 1.9 meter in height. Depending on how you will bend the rod, it might be a bit taller or smaller when you recreate it. The bend is done with a 2.4 meter long iron rod, upholstered with a 2.55 meter long piece of fabric. In total, I used:\n2.4m2 Fabric\n1.5l PUR foam\n2kg Cement\n2.4m, 4mm iron rod\n1 Bolt\n1 Ring\n4.5m Electrical wire\n1 Light socket\n1 Power plug\nSince I bought everything new, the costs for this lamp are around 20 euros. Making multiple ones, or adjusting the dimension to a smaller version would reduce these costs drastically. And if you are only a little bit like me. You will most probably already have half of these materials laying around anyhow.\nIn this Instructable I make use of a hanging mechanism which is not thoroughly documented. But anything which is higher than the lamp can be used. If you have any questions about the project and its required steps, please use the comment section for help.\nLets get started!", "title": "Appendage Lamp", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Appendage-Lamp/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "This step requires a special tool, called a \"die\". For more information on how the tap a thread using a die. Take a look at this instructable: https://www.instructables.com/id/All-About-Tapping...\n\nPreparing the iron rod\nThis whole process is pretty straight forward. Using a metal saw, you cut the rod to the desired length. In my case 2.4m. As a rule of thumb you could say that around 25% of the length will be lost when you bend the metal similar to my end-result. I made four of these lamps myself, and this is the average height. If you want to have more curves, you'll lose more length. Use less curves and it will stay longer. Pretty straight forward. If you decide to use a longer or shorter rod. Take in mind that the length of the electrical wire should be around +/- 2.5 the length of the rod. For this lamp I used a 2.4m iron rod and wrapped 4m of electrical wire around it. And this is not enough. I had somewhere in between .5m & 1m of extra length to put the plug on. Which is way to short. Do not underestimate how much length you'll lose when you add more length to your object.\nWhen you have cut the rod to the desired length. You will need to tap 1 side with a matching sized die. I would recommend to tap at least 2cm. Just to be sure. But it really depends on the space you have, underneath the foot. I used 2*3mm plywood. So theoraticly, 6mm would have been enough\nNow you have cut the rod to the desired length and added a thread to one side of the rod, you can bend it to the desired shape. Do not worry about any small imperfections. They will be unnoticeable when you put the fabric around it. It is also highly recommended to add a piece of tape or something to the end of the rod. So you won't accidentally poke it through the fabric when you pull it over the rod.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCI/U49H/JQ2O1UKH/FCIU49HJQ2O1UKH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: The (structural) Inner Rod"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Do not make this project hold you back, cause you don't know how to sew. https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Sew-using-a-sewing-machine/\nNow it gets really interesting! The fabric determines the look of the lamp. So you can go really crazy with this. It does is important to understand that it will need to have some characteristics in order to work for this project. Cause if the fabric will let the foam through it will not work. I do not yet know which types of fabrics work, and which ones won't. But based on my small set of experiments with 8 different types of fabrics I would suggest to look into felt-like fabrics or (fake) leathers. Some woven fabrics worked pretty well, like pantyhose's (denier 80). But some woven fabrics would let all the foam go through. Denim for instance looks great for not letting foam get through. But... Looks can be deceiving. So make sure you make a small sample first. Samples for this are super simple to make, just sew 2 rectangles up on each other with a small opening somewhere. So you can spray the foam inside.\nSample in denim gone wrong\nOnce you have found a fabric which is suitable for this project. You will need a lot of it. Around 265cm in length, and 90cm in width if you want to re-create the exact same tentacle lamp.\n\nThe pattern which I used is shown here. Is slightly cone shaped. Trying to emulate the shape of a tentacle. This shape adds more dynamic to the final form and it provides more surface at the bottom. Which can be exploited to create a wider, and therefor heavier, more stable foot.\n\nI drew the pattern directly onto the fabric, using a measuring tape and a black marker. But you could go all out fancy and cut a paper shape first. Or use a special fabric crayon. Most important is how you draw this shape the most easiest upon any surface. Whether it is on paper or textile. I drew 2 dots, 255cm apart from each other. Then I drew the two outlines on a 90 degrees angle. 8cm on one side, 32cm on the other. Using the 2 dots as the center point. Then using something long and (somewhat) straight to connect the dots together. Then I drew the same shape again. Normally I would just fold the fabric together. But with a pattern of this size. I would simply waste too much fabric.\nThen I cut the fabric. If you keep the seam on the outside like I did, it is important to pay attention to the cutting and cut nice straight clean lines. If you want to hide the seams by turning it inside out after sewing. It doesn't really matter how clean you cut them. Now the fabric is cut, you can start sewing. This is a really straight forward process, since it is just 1 big line. Just put the two pieces on top of each other and use some pins to keep them together.\nIf you want to hide the seams, you must put the faces you want to see in the final result facing each other. If you want to keep the seams on the outside, put the faces you want to hide on the inside facing each other.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8O/JH6E/JQ2O1W55/F8OJH6EJQ2O1W55.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Preparing the Fabric"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I will not explain how you should pour and mix concrete in this step. Mikeasaurus has a great workshop on this in much more detail I can ever cover in this Instructable https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Properly-M...\nThis step is a tricky one. It is not very difficult but it has two different factors which are related to the dimensions of concrete foot and therefore mold. The outer diameter of the mold and the center diameter. The center diameter equals the diameter of the rod + a tiny margin. I wrapped a piece of tape around a 4mm nail to comply with this extra margin. The outer diameter is related to the outer diameter of the fabric. This might seem complicated to measure, but it is rather simple. 1 Piece of fabric is 32cm in width on the bottom side. When you multiple this by 2 (since we have 2 pieces of fabric). This adds up to 64cm. This value represents the circumference of the concrete cylinder we want to pour. Because using the circumference for creating a circle is not very useful. We want to know the radius or diameter. Using basic maths, or an online calculator we can use the circumference to convert it to a radius or diameter.\n\ncircumference = \u03c0 * diameter\ndiameter = circumference / \u03c0\nin this case, the foot for this object needs to have a diameter of ~20.4cm. Because I had access to a laser cutter I made a super simple pattern and cut it out. But if you have not got a lasercutter you can achieve the same result consuming just in a little bit more time. But you can also just go rogue with this step and just use an old bucket. Glue a cap of something to the center. Pour the bucket with concrete and then drill the hole for the rod after the concrete has set. It is all up to you.\nMaking a custom mold\nThe pattern consisted of a circle of ~20cm in diameter + a smaller circle of ~5cm in diameter with a smaller circle of 0.42cm in diameter. The 20cm circle is for the foot. The 5cm circle is meant for the gap where the nut can hide in. The 0.42cm circle is the hole in the 5cm circle for the nail to go through. I then laser cut this pattern twice and cut 4 pieces of wood on the same length (slightly shorter then the length of the nail). Which ends up in having the following set of items/parts:\nBesides the nail is everything made of wood. Assembling is just done with wood glue & screws. Use the image above as a reference of how the mold should look like. When you have assembled all the parts. The base for the mold is done. Now it needs to be sealed. For this I used a piece of transparent PVC (which just happen to have something printed on it, as you can see in the picture\n). I rolled up the piece of PVC and put it inside the frame. To prevent leakage. I used a glue gun to seal the PVC with the wooden frame.\nNow the mold is done, you can pour the concrete. The more you pour, the more stable the lamp will be. I advice you to use a minimum of 2.5kg ~10cm in height. But the more you pour, the better the result.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0W/60SH/JQ2O210S/F0W60SHJQ2O210S.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Pouring the Foot"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "I will mostly skip this section, cause it is rather straight forward. Just make sure that the chord is long enough. As a rule of thumb I would advice to use a chord 2.5 the length of the iron rod. But you can play with this yourself as well. Maybe you just want to strangle the fabric more than I did or less. Depend on this personal preference you can use more or less chord. In my design, I used a 4m long chord. But I would use 5m for a next time. If you do not feel comfortable with wiring up the lightbulb, I suggest you to take a look at this class: https://www.instructables.com/class/Lamps-Class/\n.

Which ain't more than you need for this project.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 4: Electrical Wire"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Now comes the fun part! Assembling the lamp. We start by hanging the iron rod vertically with the tapped thread upwards. I created a special rig for this. A 20.4cm circle with a hole in the center, screwed upon a beam. But you could also just use the concrete foot which you have poured already. Or a bucket with a hole in it. Whatever you do to hang your rod. Make sure it is as vertical as possible. Because if you do not hang it straight, the lamp won't stand straight. This step is critical if you want your lamp not to tip over easily.\nWhen the rod hangs correct and stable. It is time to pull the fabric over it. Pull it first fully over the rod, from the bottom to the top, and make sure everything is in place how you like it. Then, slide the fabric downwards till 1 third of the rod is covered with fabric. It is important to fill the fabric in multiple steps. Cause it will clog up in the center if you foam it in on go. Resulting in an uneven result. Some parts won't have foam at all, while other will be fully hardened.\nWhen you are spraying the foam be careful and make sure the space is well ventilated. It is horrible to clean it up. When you are done foaming, fasten the fabric at the top. So it will cure in the right shape. Do not try to push the foam around inside the fabric by kneading the fabric. This will most likely get the foam through the places where you touched it. It is not super fragile. But it can happen. I have not experienced any issues with winding the electrical wire around the fabric. Do not forget this while the foam is curing. This way the fabric will bend around the chord. Make the wrapping as tight as you like. When the foam is curing, it will wrap around the chord. The tighter you wrap the chord the stronger the effect will be.\nAfter the foam is cured, you redo this step for the second part and after that the third. The last section will most certainly result in a situation, where the foam is coming out from the top. That is great! That means you do not have to worry that the concrete foot won't be big enough. You can now carefully cut away the foam so the concrete foot will be pushed against the foam when you tighten it with the nut (do not forget to put a ring between the concrete and the nut). Also be careful to not cut away to much foam. This will make the lamp wiggle upon the concrete foot.\nDo not use straws to extend the tube\nI tried to use straws as well to extend the reach of the tube. And while this is partially possible I would not recommend it. If you do not tape it well enough, the straw will be blown of the tube. Causing a huge polyurethane mess. Which is hell to clean up. Also it does not really work very well anyhow, since it does not bend that easily through the foam. It is better to just pull the fabric down.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FW7/RSAT/JQ2O2B4B/FW7RSATJQ2O2B4B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVY/WAPP/JQ2O2BKL/FVYWAPPJQ2O2BKL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7O/L7MT/JQ2O2B23/F7OL7MTJQ2O2B23.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Assembly"}], "channel": "Lighting"}, {"category": "Workshop", "description": "With this Bender You could easily. bend thicker materials.... if you want to bend bigger stock. then use bigger\nbuilding materials", "title": "Bigger Metal Bender", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Bigger-Metal-Bender/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "for this build you need the following tools\npliers, grinder, safety glasses, gloves, work bench, spanners, ear protectors\ndrill, drill bits, Welding Machine,welding mask, and gloves,\nMaterials: angle line 4 inches X2\n1/2 inch Square metal 30 inches long X 1\n1 1/2 inch X 1/2 W X 5mm thick Metal X 2.

Start from the neck. I made the neck from pine planks bought in B&Q. It does not mean that it is a good choice, the only thing I wanted was the lowest price. People normally make necks from mahogany and I suppose it will cost something like 45 pounds and more. B&Q pine wood is dry. I bought it before and the planks did not lose their straight shape. I do not say that it would be a great choice, I simply do not know what will happen with time.\nAnother choice is oak (available in B&Q, but at twice higher price than pine), but people say that oak is not good for guitar parts as it contains oil which prevents it from glueing. I however, used oak for fretboard (see below) and it was OK. Before glueing, I sanded the surface and cleaned it with spirit - I am not sure that it is really needed.\nSo, I bought some pine planks in B&Q, one being 25x68x2400 at 11 pounds(? - all prices here and below are approximate) and another plank for the head of 15 mm thickness. Try to buy planks which\n(1) have no knots and cracks\n(2) more-or-less quarter-sawn (look at the Internet what it is)\nSo, make a neck head plan on the paper (Figure 1). The main important thing is that strings from the nut to the machine (inner point of tuning machine) must be straight not touching other machine heads.\nFigure 2,3 : the neck is glued from two parts : the neck and its head.\nFigure 4,5 : the head of 15mm wood is glued of two parts, cut by jigsaw and the cuts sanded with a drum sanding kit with a drill and round files.\nGlueing the two parts. I used classic Titebond glue. At first, the task looks very simple, however, the problem is the glue makes the two parts VERY slippery and one part WILL (100%) slide under clamp's pressure. We need to use a metallic pin between the surfaces to keep them in place. This is Figure 6.\nFigures 7,8 : templates for neck shape made of 4mm MDF - the process is exactly the same as in shaping ship model body with frame templates : rub the inner surface of template with pencil, then rub the template around the blank - the marks will show you where to remove wood.\nFigures 9,10,11 : neck heel is glued from the three parts of the same pine plank. It is cut into shape with a Japanese Shinto saw rasp - very useful tool (16 pounds) (on Figure 8). It cuts wood very easily, so be very careful, especially when trying to make a plane surface - in a moment it will spoil the shape.\nThe next step is a trussrod groove (Figure 12). Trussrod is adjustable two-way 355mm in length (Tonewoods, 5 pounds). The groove must be 6mm wide with height to cover the rod. I used an Embauer router (70 pounds, Screwfix) to cut the groove. Keep one side of the neck blank straight line and parallel to the plane of symmetry (Figure 13) to let the router slide along this plane (Figure 14). The gap length should match the length of the trussrod (Figure 15).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUQ/LM8Y/JQ0TT4JX/FUQLM8YJQ0TT4JX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO7/DHQ2/JQ0TT4J9/FO7DHQ2JQ0TT4J9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7H/1BYG/JQ0TT4IL/F7H1BYGJQ0TT4IL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPN/HG4Z/JQ0TT4HX/FPNHG4ZJQ0TT4HX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK8/XDYO/JQ0TT4H8/FK8XDYOJQ0TT4H8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ0/ZNFM/JQ0TT4GJ/FJ0ZNFMJQ0TT4GJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDF/4IR3/JQ0TT4FV/FDF4IR3JQ0TT4FV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZK/LMXZ/JQ0TT4DU/FZKLMXZJQ0TT4DU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN7/HODP/JQ0TT4EW/FN7HODPJQ0TT4EW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9U/6B5L/JQ0TT4FQ/F9U6B5LJQ0TT4FQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHQ/RV8E/JQ0TT4F2/FHQRV8EJQ0TT4F2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGY/5165/JQ0TT4E8/FGY5165JQ0TT4E8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSW/KKSO/JQ0TT4CD/FSWKKSOJQ0TT4CD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU0/1DI1/JQ0TT4E2/FU01DI1JQ0TT4E2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3T/LO1X/JQ0TT4B1/F3TLO1XJQ0TT4B1.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: The Neck"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Top and back. A real problem is where to buy the wood at an acceptable price. The only place I could find it was Touchstone Tonewoods - I bought a top of two parts of spruce at 10 (?) pounds and back plus two sides of mahogany sapeli at 27 pounds. They arrive at 4-5mm thick and you must make them 3-2.5 thick.\nBut first of all, glue two parts of the top together. Glue - Titebond.\nFirst, you need to make glued surface ideally straight. For this, use the construction shown on Figure 1 : straight MDF board with one side on top. Use a big planer to cut top edge to the straight edge of MDF board. For both halves.\nThen, you need to glue these two haves with straight edges together as shown on Figure 2 : underlay a plank of some 6mm height below the glued edges, some paper under the glued edge to avoid it sticking to the table, insert nails at opposite edges and then glue the straight edge and remove the underlay. Place some weight in the edge with glue (Figure 3).\nAs a result (the down side after removal of underlay paper) is shown on Figure 4. Now we need to make the whole wood thinner. It is a problem. Even with ideally sharp planer, it may leave big cavities on the wood surface (Figure 5). So be very careful.\nThe same procedure is applied to the mahogany back (Figure 6).\nAfter some planing, I used a Triton band sander (50 pounds, Screwfix), which was useful, but of course I was unable to make ideally thickened wood. And the dust. Everything, including myself, was in dust. The target thickness of top wood must be 3mm, the back - 2.5 mm.\nIn general, a drum sander for 250-300mm wide wood with regulated target thickness would be very useful but I was unable to find anything in the UK at an acceptable price - everything is huge at some thousands pounds.\nI plan to make such a sander myself but still not sure about the design.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWK/6X97/JQ0TTKPB/FWK6X97JQ0TTKPB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN3/UIYI/JQ0TTKPA/FN3UIYIJQ0TTKPA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F16/5SPS/JQ0TTKP9/F165SPSJQ0TTKP9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIL/W2IR/JQ0TTKP8/FILW2IRJQ0TTKP8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR4/VYTG/JQ0TTKP7/FR4VYTGJQ0TTKP7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF1/VBFM/JQ0TTKP5/FF1VBFMJQ0TTKP5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR1/YHTA/JQ0TTKP4/FR1YHTAJQ0TTKP4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Top and Back"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Another useful tool is a mould for bending sides.

Oak is twice as expensive as pine. People say oak is never used in acoustic guitar construction due to its oily nature, they say that oak is hard to glue because of it. However, I made some precautions (sanded the glued surface and cleared them with spirit), but I am not sure that it is necessary.\nI glued the fretboard of two halves (Figure1) exactly as I glued two pieces of top and back with standard Titebond glue.\nThen another subtle thing : cutting the fret slots. First, you need a special fretting saw which produces accurate slots of 0.6mm wide. I bought a Hosco at Tonewoods at 24 pounds or so - quite expensive. But it does its job.\nThe slots should be located from the neck at accurate distances which are given in the Kenkead book with hundreds of millimeter accuracy. I do not think it makes much sense as, anyway, it is impossible to cut a slot even with a tens of mm accuracy. I understand the maximum you can achieve is something like 1/3 of mm. Anyway, the important parameter is the string length TO THE SADDLE, not to the nut, which is much greater and therefore more accurate in a relative sense.\nThe fret slots must be perpendicular to the centre line and the cut must be ideally vertical. When using a manual saw, the cut may be a little inclined, therefore I do not think it is a good idea to cut slots and then provide the fretboard with camber - after planing, the final fret position maybe impermissibly far from the nut. Therefore, I think the best way is to provide the fretboard with camber and THEN cut fret slots (Figure 2).\nThe next step is fingerboard inlaying.

In addition I tried neck installations with screwing the two inner bolts via the top hole, what was not very easy, and I did that multiple times as rehearsals.\nThen I inserted the trussrod at a proper position (Figure 3) pushing it a little bit (10mm) forward (Figure 4).\nAnd the glueing is shown on Figure 5.

It means that the strings must be longer.\nElectric guitars have a saddle with which you can easily change string lengths, and it is very good (Figure 1).\nThere are the two ways of fixing : (1) move saddle to make strings longer (2) move nut (actually lay something, like a piece of screw etc. under the string or make nut thicker). I tried (2) first (Figure 2) and it was working, but it seems to me not very good and I cleaned the nut (Figure 3) and chose more radical solution.\nFirst, I decreased action by decreasing saddle height. Appeared fret buzz was fixed by the truss rod adjustment (counter clockwise rotation) to increase neck bulge down. I had the action 4.5 mm before, now it is 3.5 mm. This measure made intonation much better and playing easier. I still did not change the saddle compensation nor the saddle groove - maybe I will do it later, I do not know.\nWith the next quitar, I will try to change the groove cut process - make it after necessary string length experiments for correct intonation (Figure 4).\nBy the way, wrong intonation is a very common problem : only one of my four professionally manufactured acoustic guitars (Fender) has ideal intonation; all others (a nylon string Chinese, Epiphone, Harley-Benton) all display wrong tone at frets : nylon strings should be shorter, steel strings - longer.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Q/QGC4/JRQOM8WV/F1QQGC4JRQOM8WV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJG/RVQI/JRQOM918/FJGRVQIJRQOM918.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJC/KCI8/JRQOM8SM/FJCKCI8JRQOM8SM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMU/3G5F/JRQOM8K5/FMU3G5FJRQOM8K5.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 26: Intonation Problem Fix"}], "channel": "Woodworking"}, {"category": "Workshop", "description": "After adding an inexpensive leg-vise and sliding deadman, I wanted to finish our Roubo-inspired workbench by adding a quick-release end vise.

That smile, however, immediately turned into a face of horror as he watched us simultaneously activate our Infinity Chess/t and drop him, along with all of his pieces into a never-ending abyss... MUWAHAAHAHAHAHAAH!!!!!!!\nAll crazy backstory's aside, we came up with the idea for this box after watching one of the slick infinity mirror videos that YouTube had been suggesting to us for days. Knowing we could twist the idea of what an infinity mirror could be, we set out to create the most Legendary Chess Box Of All Time!!!!\nThe wood that the framework was built with, came off of an old barn that was covered in white oak. My dad harvested the wood well over a decade ago and counted some of the tree rings finding that some of the pieces were over 100-years-old!

So in honor of its great aesthetic and terrific gameplay, we equipped this project with more features than Link's satchel! Complete with an infinity chess board, secret riddle compartment, hidden key spring drawers, and Breath of the Wild wood-burned etchings, this project took us a really long time as we screwed up some of our cuts early on in the build.

By the time I realized this I already had the pieces of veneer glued together around the ring.\nThe process was:\nGlue all the strips together as one big strip (leaving the two extremes without glue).\nWrap the strip around the ring.\nFinally, glue the very beginning to the vey end.\nI marked the spaces for gluing: 12mm on each side. I masked off this line with painters tape (masking tape). I applied the glue, removed the masking tape and lined up all the pieces. IMPORTANT: the glueing of the strips, back into one big long strip, is done with every second strip reversed. So when you look at it from the front you always see the front side of the veneer strip as it goes twisting around the plywood ring. My veneer had a paper backing which of course I didn't want to be seen.If I didn't alternate the faces of the strips when gluing them all togetherthe strips would be back-to-front after every other turn/twist on the ring.\nOnce the glue was tacky to the touch I could go ahead and glue the veneer strips all back together. Then I went about wrapping the big long strip around the ring. I got it wrong the first time and I feared my calculations might have been off. But I realised what had happened was that when I came around to what should have been the \"12th\" turn I accidentally went in front of my starting strip into the position of the \"1st\" turn. I carried on threading and twisting the veneer strip only to realise my mistake when I got to the end because the end of the strip was not where the beginning was!!!\nSoooo, I had to go back. I unwound all the veneer strip and this time I made sure the turns were numbered with bits of masking tape and I took extra care to follow my schematic drawing.

I have a fairly large glass jar and I want it to look \u2018filled\u2019. If I\u2019d gone with 2x2cm for instance, the dice wouldn\u2019t even fill up half the jar which would look a bit silly. The other advantage is that I can still use my cross-cut saw on the 4cm measurements but would get downright dangerous if I\u2019d try that on a 2cm dice. I stuck a piece of wood down (using double-sides tape) on my cross-cut saw at exactly 4cm from the cutting blade. This way I have 3 cuts to make for a pefect 4x4cm cube.\nOnce you have your 6 cubed blocks of wood, you should first find centerholes and other positions for drilling. The straight edges make it much easier and more precise to follow into the corners. I knocked off the edges straight away\u2026 and had to \u2018guess\u2019 where to set my ruler onto. Rounding the edges makes the dice more able to roll around so don\u2019t skip this step, just do it after finding centerholes and other positions described in the next step!\nI\u2019m using my router for knocking off the corners with a small rounded insert. Since these blocks are basically too small to use a plunge-router on, I secured my router up-side-down into my bench-vise.\n(NOTE; I\u2019m using the router very irresponsible here! Please don\u2019t do this if you\u2019re not completely and 100% familiar and certain with this application! In this case just grab a file or rasp and do the edges manually!\n2nd NOTE; I\u2019m intentionally not wearing gloves. These would make my fingers bulkier and more prone to getting snagged by the chisel! Always wear safety glasses with these kind of tools though!)\nNow all that\u2019s left is to give all dice a good sanding. I\u2019m using a 320grit sandpaper and a sanding machine for this.

All other markings are dependent and measured out from this centerpoint. So its safe to say it\u2019s fairy important to get this one right!\nReal easy to find though;\nDraw a cross on it connecting the opposite corners. Where the lines meet is the exact center of that face (assuming your blocks are square!). #1 covered\nNow with a protractor (triangular ruler) on any other kind of ruler I measure back 1,5cm, on both sides from the centerdot and put a marking. #\u2019s 2 and 3 covered\nDo the same for the other cross-line. #\u2019s 4 and 5 covered\nThe last two dot go in between the #4-dot markings. By centering my protractor on the 2 dots I\u2019m able to find the center quite easy for the third-hole-in-a-line for the #6 markings. By having an equal measurement on both sides aligned to the dots (which in my case is (just short of) 1,1cm), the \u20180\u2019 on the protractor becomes the center. #6 covered\n\nThe decider-dice\nInstead of using numbers to correspond to a category, I\u2019m going for colors. To make it a little more intricate (and i like the bare wood to show somewhere!), I\u2019m drilling out a hole on each side and will paint the inside of this hole to correspond to a category-dice instead of painting the entire face of a dice.\nThis means I only have one \u2018dot\u2019 to drill and color per side. This hole is made with a 3/4\u201d wood-holesaw. I taped it off about 5mm above the bottom, this will help drilling every hole equally deep.\nAfter the drilling I filled up the small hole (3 times, sanding in between) made by the drillbit using \u2018liquid wood\u2019 and sanded it smooth using a router-bit-insert (just by hand, not in a Dremel!).\nYou could also use 100 to 120 grit sandpaper and push your finger or something else small into the hole cleaning excess woodfiller up. Watch out that your not grinding down the sides of the hole, only the bottom!\n(You could skip the drilling and just paint the whole side to a corresponding color. I would paint it before routering the edges so you get nice colored squares)\n\nThe category-dice\nThe rest of the dice are normal, 1 to 6-dotted dice. These will be completely colored, corresponding to a food-category. I drill out 1 to 6 holes on each side with a 6mm wooddrill. Again I taped it off about 5mm above the bottom, this will help drilling every hole equally deep.\nI needed a even smaller router-bit-insert for sanding down some of the small fraying around the hole, and used a small round one. I didn\u2019t patch the holes in the bottom since the space is so small, I wouldn\u2019t be able to finish it off nicely.\nNOTE; all opposites sides of a dice amount to 7!

These get a primer-coating aswell (lightly sand after). Once the colored paint in the dots has dried I traced the inside ring of the hole with white paint. I thought it would look nice and make the color in the dot stand out a bit more!\nThe 6 other dice are completely covered with a single color per dice (except for the dots)..\nNOTE; it\u2019s important to make enough paint if mixing for a specific color. It very hard getting the exact color back if you run out halfway along your dice.

I had a couple around the house but don\u2019t know the outcome of the products so I prepped a couple pieces of scrap wood to see how they would look.\nI used every color and left a piece bare spread across two pieces of scrap wood.\nWha\u2026 wait a minute\u2026 what the\u2026\nAt this moment I found out I was 1 dice short\u2026 yea\u2026 I suck\u2026\nIt took me 2 days before I could go to a carpentersshop looking for a scrap piece of Maranti, I didn\u2019t have any left back home.\nAfter these 2 days I noticed that the paints on the dice still hadn\u2019t dried\u2026 and after some (hindsight) googling I found out that normal wood-primers aren\u2019t the best undercoat for my project\u2026 Me and my always-reinventing-the-wheel attitude\u2026\nAnother 2 days later I started to notice a difference\u2026 I took a good 10 days before the paint was as good as dry, so take this into consideration if painting oils (over woodprimer)!\nBack to painting\nI liked the Linseed oil the best for its finish on the decider-dice so decided to go with this one, coating the all dice with it.

I used 8/4 cherry for the carcass, and I needed to get \u00be\u201d thick boards for the sides and \u00bd\u201d thick boards for the top & bottom. For me, this started with re-sawing the board.\nPro tip: You could make this easier on yourself and buy the wood in these dimensions to begin with.\nOnce the wood is re-sawn, you\u2019ll need to remove the band saw marks and flatten the wood. I do this at the planer. I run the board on both sides through the planer. This is called \u201cskip planing\u201d. Ideally you\u2019d use a jointer here to make one side flat and then running the piece through the planer, but I don\u2019t have a jointer, and this process works for me.\nNow that you\u2019ve got your boards to the desired thickness (3/4\u201d for the sides and \u00bd\u201d for the top & bottom), it\u2019s time to move on to getting the boards to the desired length. I do this at the table saw, and I was aiming for 24\" long for one side, and 18\" long for the other side.\nThe last piece of dimensioning the lumber is to get the box to the appropriate height. Again, a jointer would be handy here, but I still don\u2019t have one\u2026 Instead, you can make your own jointer sled by using a scrap piece of wood that has one flat side on it. It needs to be at least as long as your longest piece, and wider than your widest piece. This board will be what you reference against the table saw fence. Place some double-side tape on your reference piece, and stick the board you need a straight line on top of the reference piece, letting about an 1/8\u201d hang over. Once you have one flat edge on your wood, then you can remove it from the reference piece and run it through the table saw at your desired height \u2013 My table is 6\" tall.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZY/GLAO/JPN3Q238/FZYGLAOJPN3Q238.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAK/U04D/JPN3Q25M/FAKU04DJPN3Q25M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKJ/VJGF/JPN3Q285/FKJVJGFJPN3Q285.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTA/GEXC/JPN3Q28F/FTAGEXCJPN3Q28F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTM/SBWO/JPN3Q2AW/FTMSBWOJPN3Q2AW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBL/VMVZ/JPN3Q2D7/FBLVMVZJPN3Q2D7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Dimensioning the Lumber"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I bought a Red Collibah burl slab to use for this project.

I', guessing the latter.\n\nThe head had some medium light rust on it which probably would have come off well with a wire wheel but it was also covered in cement which didn't come off that easily. I figured that, in theory vinegar as acid should dissolve cement which I believe is a base. So I submerged the head in vinegar. This seemed to work well. Most of the cement had fallen off in few hours. I used a wire wheel to remove the rest of the rust and cement which were not very loose and came off easily because of the vinegar treatment.

I've noticed the medium grit is unnecessary to use between the rough and fine as that also yields a mirror surface. Therefore after going through all of the surfaces with the rough pad I changed to fine. When polishing, if possible, you should try to change the polishing direction when you change to finer grit. This way you can see when you have polished off all the lines from the previous grit.\nAfter the finer scorching pad, I changed to wool flap wheel on a drill press. I used a metal polishing compound on the wheel. That removed all the lines that were left from the fine pad. Sometimes you might need to use also a rougher and finer polishing compound, and they usually come in the same package.

Casting is a simple way to get a good fit for the handle (wood isn't that hard either but this is almost effortless), but metal handle will be harder for your hands when you use the hammer. In this case I made what any artist would do, I chose the one that looks cooler... However to dampen the vibrations I designed the handle with thinner section to wrap with leather.\nI cut the rough design with a hot wire from styrofoam. Then I used belt sander to further sculpt the shape I wanted. If you are not experienced in casting, like me, It's a good idea to leave a little extra foam on the model as aluminum is easy to sand down and the surface can always end up with some imperfections.\nI made the handle from three parts, pommel, the handle to be wrapped and the thicker part of the handle that will be left unwrapped. By using three separate parts it was easier to sculpt the parts but harder to keep them lined up with each other. After sculpting the parts I used hot glue to put them together. In addition to these parts I made a sprout for pouring the metal and \"cap\" on top of the hammer to seal it from the sand and to attach an air tube to.\nAfter the whole thing was assembled I put it in a wooden box an buried it in casting sand. I used a wooden stick to press the sand tightly against the mold the get the best possible surface. I made funnel from old steel can. You want to have rather high funnel/sprout because that will increase the pressure in the mold (like water tower). This will result to better casting and will enable you to cast larger objects, e.g. in this model without enough pressure the aluminum would not have made it all the way to the hammer head. As I was covering the model with sand I also added a plastic straw to the \"cap\" of my mold to be used as an air tube. If there was no air tube. Some air would be trapped in the mold and the casting would fail.\nBefore the actual casting I still poked some air holes trough the sand along the handle with a barbeque stick. I also burned most to my sprout because it would only slow the aluminum downs as I pour. The casting sand packed around the sprout will hold it's form and I will have just a pouring hole left.\nAfter preparing the mold I heated up the aluminum in my furnace and poured it in the mold and hoped for the best. After letting the aluminum to cool down I took it out from the sand and noticed it was quite successful. The top half of my mold seemed to have some pits. I think my air holes might have been blocked somehow as the aluminum only came out from one of them.

I didn't polish the thinner part of the handle as I would wrap it and the cast surface will be hidden.\nI cut a strip of buffalo hide to wrap the handle with. I clamped a metal ruler to a board with the leather under it to get straight enough strip. Leather will always stretch so it doesn't have to be exactly straight. Then I cut a piece of string and folded it once and taped it on the handle as in the pictures. I wrapped the leather by first wrapping the leather on top of itself and then moving down the handle so that each layer of leather was half way on the previous layer so that I had a nice thick handle. The string that was left under the wrapped leather is now used to pull the other end of the leather under itself. I pulled the end of the leather strip trough the loop in the string then I shortened and started to pull the string from the other end. After a while of struggling I manged to pull the end of the leather strip under itself and the string out from the other side. I think this is a nice way to wrap the handle as now I don't have the ends of the strip glued in place or anything like that.

After designing the frames of the nightstand, desk, and bed, it was carefully planned how each required piece would come from 8ft 2x4s with minimum waste.\nThe bed was designed with a foam mattress in mind, which requires a solid surface for the mattress to rest on. The alternative, a spring mattress, usually sits on slats. Due to this design decision, buying several large sheets of plywood was also necessary. If designing for a spring mattress this additional material is not needed.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FP0/H5LE/JPCY8M2U/FP0H5LEJPCY8M2U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOG/815V/JPCY8M36/FOG815VJPCY8M36.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMW/OK3S/JPCY8M37/FMWOK3SJPCY8M37.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Design"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Bed:\n10x 8ft 2x4 stud\n2x 4x8ft plywood sheet\n1lb 2.5in construction screws\nDesk:\n4x 8ft 2x4 stud\n1x 2x4ft 3/4in melamine sheet\nscrews\n(optional) 1 roll iron-on melamine edge tape\n(optional) 1x4ft plywood sheet\nNightstand:\n2x 8ft 2x4 stud\n2x4ft plywood sheet\nscrews\n(OPTIONAL) Paint:\n2x Paint roller kit\nMultipurpose latex primer (the cheap stuff at Sherwin Williams)\nLatex interior paint (we went with SW 2808 brown and black)\nNotes:\n\u2022 The quantities above are rough estimates and can be improved through careful planning. We ended up making 3 desks, a bed, and a nightstand using only 2 full sheets of plywood, 3 lbs of screws, and 25 2x4s. By combining the required lengths of all the pieces creatively into the stock wood, we were able to get away with buying less wood while minimizing wasted material. If possible, build your furniture all at once and with a friend or two. This allows you to coordinate lumber use as efficiently as possible.\n\u2022 Melamine is a coated wood product that is relatively cheap as well as water, stain, scratch resistant. For these reasons, it makes a perfect desk or counter top. In hindsight, melamine would have also made an excellent choice for the nightstand and even the bed if you can afford it. If you'd like, you can buy iron-on rolls of the coating to cover the bare wood edges of the melamine and improve the look and feel of the furniture.\n\u2022 The desks we made have a piece of plywood on the back that serves several purposes. Firstly, it helps to reinforce the structure, adding stability to the frame and legs. Secondly, it adds a convenient place to attach Command hooks or other cable management solutions. This piece isn't totally required, but since we had leftover plywood from the bed frame, we thought it was a good idea. If you're just making a desk, it might not be worth the extra money or hassle. Up to you!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFF/T558/JKCUM17N/FFFT558JKCUM17N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR7/XW7B/JPCY8KMY/FR7XW7BJPCY8KMY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Materials"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "\u2022 Since we have access to an awesome wood shop in the Invention Studio, we decided to trim and surface all the 2x4s to clean them up. This also resulted in an extremely clean and modern aesthetic. Firstly, we thoroughly checked each stud for nails and staples that would destroy the tablesaw or planer blades. If finishing the studs this step is critical. We then trimmed a 1/4\" cut off each side of the 2x4s on the tablesaw to remove the filleted edges on the lumber and square up each board, reducing the width from 3.5in to 3in. Finally, we took one pass on each side of the boards with the planer, reducing the thickness from 1.5in to just over 1.25in. The planer removed any discoloration or roughness from the boards and left us with a smoother surface. If you don't have access to these tools or you're really pressed for time, this step can be omitted, just remember to adjust the dimensions accordingly.\n\u2022 BONUS: The cutoffs from the tablesaw (long, thin pine strips) made excellent firewood for a few nights. That weekend we were between a student dorm and our new apartment and had nowhere to live, so we ended up camping at a nearby campground. The cutoffs allowed us to cook for 3 nights over the fire, for zero extra money.

We chose to use a miter saw, but use any tool you have. Just be sure to measure each piece accurately and take your time cutting each piece precisely. Small errors are probably ok, but they could lead to misfitting components when the parts are assembled.\nWe marked and cut the plywood with a tracksaw, but you could use a circular saw, hacksaw, or other to cut these to size. On the nightstand shelf, a jigsaw was used to cut the notches in the corners. It's important that the cuts are made square, as they are used to pull the frame into alignment during assembly.

This prevents the wood from splitting, which was especially crucial as many screws mount into the ends of boards. Then, we used a countersink on the pilot holes to allow for a cleaner look. This step is optional, and we found that the 2x4s really didn\u2019t benefit from this step. Lastly, we drove the screws into the pilot holes using an impact driver. This worked great to quickly and easily screw everything together. Theoretically all the screws could be driven with a hand screwdriver, but we recommend using an impact driver or at least a power drill.\nFor most of the joints, we carefully checked the CAD model to understand how the pieces fit together, then used a large square to hold everything in place while two screws were driven into each joint. Using a square isn't strictly necessary, but it helped tremendously in keeping all the joints true and precise. It is definitely recommended if you can find one and if you cannot, building a square with scrap material is also a valid and easy option.\nNotes:\n\u2022 Having a buddy to hold pieces in place while you drive screws is incredibly valuable. They are often more responsive and adaptable than clamps.\n\u2022 When adding the desk tops, use a ruler to mark where the desk structure goes, then mark where to add screws. Drill the pilot holes, and flip the desk over and onto the structure, aligning the marks with the 2x4s underneath. Countersinking is absolutely necessary on the melamine to prevent cracking the protective finish. This method kept everything aligned and ensured that the screws went into the center of the 2x4s.\n\u2022 When screwing in the plywood sheets, using a screw about every 14-16in worked well. More or less screws can be used as you please. We used the same 2.5in construction screws that were used for everything else, but with some careful planning, you might be able to save some money by using shorter screws for the plywood.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHZ/Y6JV/JPCY8KN4/FHZY6JVJPCY8KN4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHV/SP2R/JPCY8KN6/FHVSP2RJPCY8KN6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGS/0GEA/JPCY8KN7/FGS0GEAJPCY8KN7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCL/JVQI/JKCUM186/FCLJVQIJKCUM186.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6C/SUOJ/JKCUM189/F6CSUOJJKCUM189.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9Q/AGLC/JKCUM187/F9QAGLCJKCUM187.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F88/JDOD/JPCY8KO4/F88JDODJPCY8KO4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2D/6QAG/JPCY8KO5/F2D6QAGJPCY8KO5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC3/MYL3/JPCY8KND/FC3MYL3JPCY8KND.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUX/YLG0/JPCY8KNA/FUXYLG0JPCY8KNA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5D/S5OE/JPCY8KN8/F5DS5OEJPCY8KN8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNX/HO96/JKCUM195/FNXHO96JKCUM195.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKL/5LA5/JKCUM19Z/FKL5LA5JKCUM19Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP8/WAXD/JKCUM19Y/FP8WAXDJKCUM19Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEZ/QBEX/JKCUM192/FEZQBEXJKCUM192.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWS/DTSA/JKCUM18O/FWSDTSAJKCUM18O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV9/CUXC/JKCUM18Q/FV9CUXCJKCUM18Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEG/O680/JKCUM198/FEGO680JKCUM198.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6T/85TK/JKCUM1AP/F6T85TKJKCUM1AP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDK/1FHE/JPCY8KO7/FDK1FHEJPCY8KO7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Assembly"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Sanding everything isn't strictly necessary,\nbut it's a great idea and totally worth doing.

This knocks down any sharp corners or edges and helps soften all the lumber for a better feel. This was especially critical for the bed frame as the mattress lays directly on the plywood. Don't go crazy, but use an orbital sander or belt sander (or both in our case) to sand every surface of every piece of furniture at 150 and 220 grit.

We bought some melamine edge banding that irons on to the exposed edge of the desk tops, protecting and hiding the ugly particleboard core. This stuff is $4 a strip and very easy to apply, so I definitely recommend it. Just follow the instructions on the packaging.\n2. LED underglow. I bought some RGB LED strips on Amazon that came with a \"smart\" controller, which is WiFi enabled and connects to my Google Home. I 3D printed some small clips at the Invention Studio and used hot glue to attach these clips to the underside of the bed frame and desk. This allowed me to mount the LED strips more securely than the included adhesive backing. This addition is totally unnecessary, but the voice-controlled LED lighting is awesome and really impresses anyone who comes over. Plus, my apartment didn't come with an overhead light, so this gives me some light in my room at night.\n3. Free office chairs. This one is tricky - we had planned on buying some cheap chairs on Amazon, but the week after we finished our furniture, the Mechanical Engineering department threw out some old office chairs. They have some wear and small rips on the armrests, and the fabric pattern is a bit dated, but you really can't beat the price point of absolutely free!\n4. Cheap mattresses. We wanted to buy new mattresses, but we\u2019re college students and have a matching budget. Naturally, we took to Amazon and found some super cheap queen-sized 12 inch thick foam mattresses. This isn't a product endorsement or anything, but we think they are super comfortable and even cheaper than some of the used options we\u2019ve seen locally.

Glad to see you again. It is Zep here, and this time we are building a bandsaw!\nWell fellas, I always thought a bandsaw is a magic thing. You can rip, you can cross-cut, you can resaw, you can make your own veneers and fancy bandsaw boxes. In general, you just have to flip a switch,and you are pretty much ready to make all sorts of fancy cuts. But there is also one big problem regarding bandsaws.... I never had one!\nBut those days are now over. Today we are making us one! And since I am a bit tight in my tiny workshop, I'm gonna go with a small- benchtop version. But the idea here is pretty much the same, regardless the size of the machine. So how about we now get to it, and hopefully when we are done I 'll have convinced you to build one for yourself, at a size of your liking?\nLet's have a look!", "title": "Homemade Benchtop Bandsaw", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Homemade-Benchtop-Bandsaw/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "My understanding is that, when talking bandsaws, there are pretty much two things that define them. Size and power! And since the relate in a proportional way, let's start with size..\nOk, we agreed that this is gonna be a small saw. But how small? Possibilities here are endless, and the final size is completely up to you, but we gotta start somewhere. So I went to my local hardware store to get a better taste on cosumables.The blade! Long story short, I found out that where I live the most common blade size, which I can find in pretty much every hardware store and for pretty cheap, is 1.4 meters in circumference. This is tiny, Just what we wanted! So, we are gonna go with that...\nNow, having the blade size sorted, let's talk a bit about the size of the saw, the actual machine I mean. Usually, a bandsaw's size is defined by the diameter of it's wheels. So when you hear about a \"16-inch\" bandsaw, this usually means that each one of it's wheels is 16 inches in diameter. And if you think of it, this pretty much translates that the distance between the blade (the spot you use to make the cut) and the column of the machine is no greater than 16 inches! So there is that, also..\nLast thing we would like to have in mind is the resaw capacity. The maximum height of a cut you can make with you bandsaw. This is the distance between the lowest spot of your upper wheel and the top of your bandsaw's table.It is the maximum lenght of the blade that travels between thin air, which you are actually using to make your cut!\nSo with those in mind I grabed a pencil and a piece of paper and a couple of minutes later I was stuck with this conclusion:\nHaving a 140 cm long blade, I would make my wheels 19 cm in diameter each, which would give me both a maximum resaw capacity and a column-to-blade distance of around 18 cm. This is a crazy-big resaw capacity for such a small bandsaw, given that ready-made bandsaws using this size of a blade have a maximum resaw capacity of arround 9 cm! I went this way cause I intend on trying to use all of that capacity one day, making veneers or something. Just keep in mind that by doing that, you sacrifice some also precious capacity, between your blade and your column. I'm not that smarter from all the toolmaking industry! I just have my priorities differently sorted!\nOk, now we are getting somewhere! And since we are talking numbers, lets talk a bit about the motor...", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Configuring the Specs"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Ok, you know that already! We need something to spin our blade. Then you just push some stock against in and voila...it's cut! Not a single drop of sweat needed..\nSo you could use steam-power, a river, a hamster and a wheel. But you know what proves to be very handy and efficient these days?? Motors!\nNow, I made a video specifically on this subject, which you can find embeded above, but let's talk a bit about that real quick, in case you are more of a reading person!\nI originally had in mind using a tiny in size, quite impressive in power DC motor salvaged from an old cooking machine (it was a blender of some sort). The little thing produced 400 Watts which could make my little bandsaw quite a mean machine! But it turned out there is a problem with that idea....that little thingy runs crazy fast! Which got me thinking....\nI went online and did some research. Found out that a good average speed to run a woodworking bandsaw is 3000 feet per minute, blade travel. Of course this number can differ, depending on the material you are gonna cut, the size of your saw maybe, the nature of the job you are gonna execute, your blade's tpi , the rate that you feel most comfortable feeding your stock to your blade etc. But we can pretty much safely assume that 3000 feet/minute blade travel is gonna work for you. Just make sure you are not cutting metal!\nSo as you unsderstood, a bit more math is needed here. Just a tiny bit and we are back in having fun, I promise! My bottom wheel is where the motor is gonna be mounted somehow, and therefore, is what is gonna be driving my blade. This wheel as we said is gonna be 19 cm in diameter, which if you multiply by pi gives a 59,7 cm circumference. The blade rides against that circumference, which means for a full rotation of that wheel, my blade will be moved by 0,597 meters. So if I need that blade moving 3000 feet/minute which translates to 914,4 meters/minute, i need to turn it for 914,4/0,597= 1532 rotations per minute. Let's call it 1500 rpm!\nNot even close! The motor I intended to use runs 15 thousand rpm in the slowest speed! Now that's a huge gap to fill with pulleys n' belts (we are looking for a 10 to 1 reduction here. Even for the smallest pulley possible on my motors shaft, I would need one bigger than my 19cm wheel on the other side of that belt. And using two step reduction would make things way too complicated for such a simple project!) So I had to come up with a better way..\nI used a hand drill! Cordless!\nI have already seen such bandsaws made to run on drills online, and it seems like a descent idea! There is a thing that makes them questionable in my head though... Fellow makers, usually go for corded drills. These are great if you want to put a large hole on a concrete wall or something but there is also one thing they suck at...maintaining speed! It is not a bad thing to have, but those tools are more maintaining-power oriented.\nOn the contrary, think a moment about your little battery powered handrill. You press the trigger, and boom! It's up to speed. You start throwing some load on it, and it starts drawing more current from your batteries. If it could draw 300 Amps, believe me it would. And then it' d burst into flames! So the little thing is working hard for you. And working smart. Let's take advantage of that!\nI went to the junk pile and found me an old 14.4 V hand drill. Used to use Ni-CD batteries back in the day, which were of course dead by now. Hooked it to a 12V 16 Amp power supply, pressed the trigger all the way and reached for my tachometer. 780 rpm. Only half of what we wanted!\nOk it is slow. But it also has some bright sides. I can mount that directly on my shaft (mounted to the bottom bandsaw wheel) and I can do that easily. There's already a chuck on that thingy! The other bright thing about that approach is that I don't need to go out bying motors. Those things can get pricey, especially if you are in a hurry!\nSo, even though I didn't love the idea( it's a bit on the slow side and it requires power supplys that many of you may not have), I'm gonna stick with that until I find me a better solution..\nAnd now he have it all sorted. Let's build the thingy!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FS2/RPU3/JP8NU1N3/FS2RPU3JP8NU1N3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFO/3FFN/JP8NU1N6/FFO3FFNJP8NU1N6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The M-O-T-O-R!"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "You know what they say. You have to make sawdust in order to make more sawdust! So let's get to work...\nFor the main part of this machine I'm gonna use some plywood I had laying arround. To be accurate, I'll be using a funny structure that I picked up from the side of the road and was living in the trunk of my car for quite a while now! It consists of 20 and 25 mm thick pieces of poplar plywood. Poplar is not my thing, especially if I go bying stock, but if found someplace while also having an empty trunk, it's not something that I would be too picky about! You'll need about a quarter of a sheet..\nFirst thing here is to turn our wheels. And to do that, you also need to decide what size shafts and bearings you will be using. I went for a 12 mm shaft and the according bearings, which I also had laying arround. They should offer more than enough stifness for that small of a blade.\nFor the wheels I used some of the 25 mm plywood, just to be a bit heavier. Gives you momentum. I cut two square pieces roughly in size and after picking a center on each one, I used a divider to make a circle with a circumference of 19 centimeters. I happen to have a lathe (or two!) but if you don't, you can use a corded drill to turn them round. Yes, one of those that I was complaining about earlier.....!\nAt this point you want to be as accurate as you can get! Getting your wheels round and balanced is the single most critical thing about this whole make. Everything else you can also do wrong! Ok, don't freak out, we 'll maybe fine tune them later, while they are in place, but doing your best to get the center hole and the OD aligned, will be saving you a lot of labor later.\nThe bottom wheel is gonna have just a 12 hole on the center, since it's gonna be turning with the shaft. (this hole you wan't to make as vertical as you can get it. Square to the face of the wheel) While the upper wheel is gonna turn arround it's shaft, meaning that we need to fit a couple of bearings in there!\nTo be honest, my upper wheel I made two times. The first one I started by turning the wheel round and later drilling a center hole which I enlarged on both sides to accomodate my bearings. But I got the center hole of center! (I don't own a tailstock chuck for my lathe!) So I roughly cut another one, and this time I started with the center hole(s). Then I mounted on a corded drill, using an M12 screw and some washers, which I used as a lathe and turned my wheel true arround the centerhole this time. Already told ya, this is quite critical!\nHaving now our wheels sorted, I cut two identical pieces, out of the 20 mm thick plywood, for the body of the bandsaw, which I laminated (more like screwed for now!) together. This structure you want to be taller than your wheel-blade assembly, and a fair bit wider to leave you some room for a stiff enough column. Something like 70cm by 30cm in my case. Then you place your wheels aproximately where they have to go, you put your blade around them and push them apart, to tension your blade a bit. This whole thing you move arround and you eyeball where it is gonna be mounted on the body. You want your wheels almost flush to the right side of your body piece (leave a cm or two offset there for various things we may need later) and your wheels' centerholes on a line that is sqaure to the base of your body stock. You need your wheels vertical in order for your blade to run vertical! You just make a mark for each center hole and you relax for a bit!\nOn the mark for the bottom wheel's centerhole, you make a hole slightly bigger that the shaft you are gonna use (you don't want it rubbing in there!) and later, you enlarge this whole on both sides to fit a bearing. Again, you want your bearings to sit in there as perpendicular to the face of the body as you can get them (holes need to be vertical!) in order for your blade to track straight when you are done. I had a total of five bearing in hand, and my upper wheel would not fit more than two on it, so I decided to use all the remaining three of them down there. I placed two of them on the back side (the side where the drill is gonna be) and I glued them in place using some epoxy, a square and a shaft placed inside them to give me refference point. They came out square enough! Once the glue dried,and with the shaft still in place, I went on the front side and fitted my third bearing, which I pushed all the way back to touch the body. I marked it's outline and using a handheld router, I routed a hole slightly larger than my bearing. Then, using also some epoxy, I glued the bearing inside that hole, while still riding on the shaft, making sure it 'll come out perfectly alligned with the other two bearings on the back side (known to be square already).\nHold on, we are getting there I promise!\nNow for the upper wheel, a mark and a hole are not gonna cut it! You need a way to move that wheel, either away or closer to your other wheel, to tension/ untension your blade. Ok, here is what we are gonna do!\nFor starters you just make a huge square hole arround your mark for the center of the upper wheel. I'm not talking with numbers here cause, again, you might want to make a bigger bandsaw! Also the size of this hole is not too significant. You can check out the photos above to get an estimate on roughly how big you want it!\nNow, this hole needs to be square to the body of the machine, but dont sweat too much about that. More significantly, it needs to be square itself! The left and right side need to be perpendicular, since in there is gonna slide another piece. You dont want it stuck on one side and loose on the other. Top and bottom sides, they dont matter too much. I used a router,some guides and a lot of measurement and I got it just right. You can do that too!\nSince you have that ready, you now need to make the slider we talked about. Using some of the same material ( 20mm thick plywood) you cut two square pieces, shorter than your hole in height, but exactly up to size in width. Take your time, cut them slighlty bigger and then recut them a little bit at a time. Since you have them ready, fitting in there and being able to slide up and down the socket, you need to find a way to keep them in there.\nI used some aluminum bar I had laying arround. It is 3 cm wide, 3mm thick, and I cut two pieces at lenght , same as the height of my slider. Then I unscrewed the pieces forming my bandsaw's body, and at the inner side of one of them I made a rabbet on each side of that square socket (left and right) 3mm deep and around 1 cm wide. I also made a same rabbet on one of my slider pieces but this time it was 2 cm wide. Screwed my aluminum profile pieces in there,and placed the aluminum parts sticking out on the body's rabbet. Then I assembled the whole body again, and I glued my second slider on the other one (the one with the aluminum in it). Then I drilled a hole in my slider, where the centerhole of my uper wheel needs to be. This time the hole needs to be tight fit with the shaft holding the wheel in place. Remember this shaft is not gonna spin..\nOk, you probably lost me by now! I know. Truth is , there is nothing too scientific about it! Just have a look on the photos of the make provided above and you 'll get it straight in no time!\nNow we need a way to move and lock that slider in place. We gotta tenion that blade!\nI moved the slider on the highest spot ( furthest spot possible from our lower wheel) and using a 10 mm diameter drill bit I drilled from the top of my machine through both the body and the slider, towards the base of it. On the bottom end of this hole on my slider I mounted a T-nut, which I secured in place using some epoxy. Then I used an M8 threaded rod which slided through the 10 mm whole on the top of my machine, and srewed on the T-nut mounted on the slider. Once in place I secured this bolt there using a nut at the top part of my slider's socket, on which I drilled a tiny hole and broke a pin. And voila! By turning that threaded rod, you can move your slider up and down!\nWe are now ready to mount our upper wheel! I used a carriage bolt (with a 12 mm shaft and an M12 tread) which I pushed through: a washer- my upper wheel - a washer - another washer - my slider's centerhole - a couple more washers and a nut which I used to tighten the whole assembly a bit. The washers on the front side need to be smaller than the outer ring of our bearing and they are to provide clearence for it to spin. The ones behind the wheel are also to give it some clearence from the body of the machine, so it can spin freely and the ones I used in the back of the slider are just because my carriage bolt didn't have a thread long enough to get my nut against the slider and tighten everything!\nYou can try cutting a bit more thread on an M12 bolt using a die, but I wouldn't recomend that! I only managed to make one or two turns up there,before I broke my vise. A cast iron vise!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNM/PPBX/JP8NU1LA/FNMPPBXJP8NU1LA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDR/ORMH/JP8NU1LF/FDRORMHJP8NU1LF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNE/FDWK/JP8NU1LG/FNEFDWKJP8NU1LG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDG/2J29/JP8NU1M5/FDG2J29JP8NU1M5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3R/YYYY/JP8NU1M6/F3RYYYYJP8NU1M6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQJ/Q0LZ/JP8NU1MC/FQJQ0LZJP8NU1MC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7K/KV34/JP8NU1MF/F7KKV34JP8NU1MF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAM/W0XH/JP8NU1ME/FAMW0XHJP8NU1ME.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDH/V1TE/JP8NU1MG/FDHV1TEJP8NU1MG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFJ/NWOY/JP8NU1MH/FFJNWOYJP8NU1MH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFO/3004/JP8NU1MI/FFO3004JP8NU1MI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2V/SKSH/JP8NU1MZ/F2VSKSHJP8NU1MZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8M/W0TO/JP8NU1MJ/F8MW0TOJP8NU1MJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F74/9VSV/JP8Z476Q/F749VSVJP8Z476Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJM/4ZRD/JP8Z476R/FJM4ZRDJP8Z476R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQB/Y4ZO/JP8NU1MM/FQBY4ZOJP8NU1MM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM1/M79N/JP8NU1N0/FM1M79NJP8NU1N0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIF/BBHS/JP8NU1MN/FIFBBHSJP8NU1MN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9I/D1OP/JP8NU1MO/F9ID1OPJP8NU1MO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRO/VIOY/JP8NU1MP/FROVIOYJP8NU1MP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGG/QPR9/JP8NU1MR/FGGQPR9JP8NU1MR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGC/7PIJ/JP8NU1MS/FGC7PIJJP8NU1MS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCF/1YVM/JP8NU1MV/FCF1YVMJP8NU1MV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9H/97YW/JP8NU1MW/F9H97YWJP8NU1MW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEZ/BP1K/JP8NU1N8/FEZBP1KJP8NU1N8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFF/L60U/JP8NU1NA/FFFL60UJP8NU1NA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5I/0KCO/JP8NU1NB/F5I0KCOJP8NU1NB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FML/ARXN/JP8Z477T/FMLARXNJP8Z477T.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: The Build"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Ok, I was writing for way too long now, and I thought a big bold tittle would freshen you up a bit!\nWe are not there yet, but the most of the work is done already. A few more stuff and you 'll be cutting stuff on your new bandsaw like a pro!\nHaving your wheels mounted and a way to drag them apart, feel free to throw up there your blade and tension it. Now we are gonna cut the body to make us a work area!\nWith the blade in place and under tension, we are gonna decide how much of the body we are gonna cut away. You want to mark the lowest spot of your upper wheel, the highest one of your lower wheel and you also want a line underneath of where your blade is tracking, left and right. And that's all! Now you can remove both your wheels and blade.\nThe mark you made for your upper wheel, you want to move it for about a centimeter to the bottom. And the one you made for your lower wheel, also move that for the same distance towards the top. That's becuuse you need you body overhanging the end of your wheels a bit, so it gives you some space to buid a wheel cover arround them.\nAlso the line where your blade is tracking to the left side ( the side you got no use for) you should move it a bit towards the right (towards the side of the blade you are gonna use when cutting). That's beacuse the left side of the blade you want to run above the column of the machine, which also makes it easier for you to enclose it inside a cover, when you make one.\nDone already? Ok. Now you grab you best square and draw a line for each mark (the ones you offset before, top and bottom) all the way from the very right side of you body stock to the line you offset (the left track of the blade). You should have a square now, around the middle of your machine's body (heightwise), and all the way to the right ( widthwise). And if you were accurate with your measurements during this whole project,it should also be square to the body! If not, no worries, that's an easy fix... Either way, cut this out! We no longer need that square there...\nStarting to look more like a bandsaw, isn't it?!\nAt this point you need to make a base for it, if haven't already. I did't have enough plywood left in a single piece , so I cut and butt-joined two pieces together to form me a baseboard. The front part of the base will overhang the bandsaw's body for around 10 cm and the back one will be as long as my drill is. Again, the size is not critical as long as it provides a good hold and your saw will not tip over while using it!\nI placed my bandsaw body vertical where it had to go on the base, and drew a line around it. Using my router I made a rabbet 10 mm deep inside that line, where I would push fit my bandsaw, to provide a better hold and cut the vibrations down a bit. After I hammered that in place I used some L brackets to secure it in place in a vertical position. On the side behind my column I used a rather large, reinforced bracket that I got from the hardware store , which stiffened my machine a whole lot!\nAnd now that I talked about stiffness. I noticed that there was a bit of flex in my saw's column, which I really didn't like. Reason for that may be that my two layers of plywood were not laminated together, they are still hold together with screws, or even 40 mm thickness of questionable quality poplar plywood are not enough for the job! So I decided to reinforce my column a bit with a piece of 19 mm thick spruce board, which I rip cut to fit the width of my column and then glued on the back side of my machine's body. This stiffened things a whole lot!\nAfter that I made a holder for my driving handrill to be kept in place (photos above) and I mounted that where it needed to go. A bit of extra attention deserves to be given here, so that the center of the drill's chuck is at the same height as the center of the bottom wheel's axis. Also you wan't that axis completely alligned with the fictionary axis that goes through the center of your drill (picture your drill motor's shaft). Again, take your time here, cause if not, you can end up with a mess of vibration!\nAnd we are nearly there!\nI glued the axis on the bottom wheel using some epoxy and a large washer (gave me some extra gluing surface) and the other end of that shaft I secured inside the drill chuck. Hooked a power supply to power my drill with ( I am using a 12 V /16 Amp power supply, which at max trigger spins my 14,4 V rated handrill at arround 780 rpm) and I slowly pressed the trigger. Well people......the blade tracks!\nIt tracks even at maximum revs, but not where I 'd want it to! Thing is that, when making your wheels round, you also want to put a crown in them. A slight bulge let's call it, which will make your blade track right in the midle of your wheel's thickness. Tensioning the blade had pulled my wheel down a bit, which made the blade track at the veru tip of it. Which made you think it would come out any time and made you nervous for no good reason! We gotta fix that....\nAnd to do that we need a tracking adjustment. Something that would slighlty move our upper wheel, and fix that ridgidly in place. And I have an idea on that!\nI turned two round plugs on the lathe, which I mounted on the back of my bandsaw, left and right to the slider's socket and on the bottom part of it. I removed the nut tightening my upper wheel on the slider assembly, and on the back side of the carriage bolt, where the nut used to be, I placed one of those bolts that instead of a bolt head have a ring. I placed that ring around my bolt and tightened again with a nut, leaving the rest of the bolt hanging towards the bottom and on the back side of the machine. Then I drilled a hole on a bar of cold rolled steel , let that hanging bolt go past that hole, and use an according nut to tighten on the lower side, until it dragged my cold rolled towards the upper wheels shaft and against the plugs I mounted earlier on the body. This way, tightening further the nut arround the hanging bolt, it pulled the back part of my upper wheel's axis towards the bottom, making it pivot a bit inside my slider. It's just a tiny bit of movement, but it's all we wanted to call it a \"tracking adjustment\"!\nNow with the saw running and the blade tracking, all you need is a table!\nI grabed a 35cm by 35 cm piece of 18 mm plywood, and made a rather large square whole on the center of it, with an 8 mm deep rabbet arround it. Then I picked a side, drew a straight line joining the side of it with the square hole at the middle of it, powered up my new bandsaw and made a cut where that line used to be!\nJust be cautious, for the first two or three centimeters of that cut, where your stock is unsupported. Always keep a negative rake so that the blade won't throw the piece right back at you! After those first centimeters, you can place your piece against the body of the machine and cut safely until your blade sits someplace inside that square hole you made earlier. Now you unplug the bandsaw! You turn the table so that the slot you just cut runs towards the column of your saw, you match that slot with the center of the thickness of your body, and you screw your table in place! This way, it makes it sturdier, compared to scenario where you let the slot for the blade hanging on any other side of the table (this way also makes it impossible to remove your blade without first removing the table though..Your choice!)\nNow if you paid attention to where you draw those lines earlier, you should have a table square to the track of your blade and a saw ready to run! You just grab an 8mm thick piece of plywood and you use that to make a cover for that huge square hole arround your blade. Once in size, you power up your saw again, and carefully you put that cover in place with the saw running, to make a slot for it to travel in place.

A blade spinning on some wheels, is not a safe thing, and you are a grown person (probably!) . I shouldn't be writing you those stuff!\nNow, theory says that, when your bandsaw is finished and while using it, the only part of the blade that will be exposed will be the same lenght as the thickness of the board you are cutting, plus a little something to make it a bit easier on you. In other words, you need a cover and some blade guides! And since it would be awesome if we already had our bladeguides when making our cover, so that we can take them into account, let's start there..\nSo, regarding bladeguides. You need two of them, top and bottom! Think of it this way. You were about to use your saw, as we left it, and you grab a piece of timber, you throw that up on your table and you push that against your blade. What is gonna happen?\nWell, probably nothing, since it is your first time using this machine and you 'd most likely be extra cautious! But what if you had to make 100 pieces of that thing you are making? What about if you even had 100 identical pieces to make?? They can get a bit boring after a while..And you could easily end up pushing your stock against your blade at a rate that the only support it has, which is from it's tension on the wheels, cannot handle. And then, the situation could go pear-shaped! The very least is that, doing that you put a bow into your blade, puting tension into the back part of it and getting it away from the front (where the teeth are). This would make your blade drifting, and make it hard on you to cut along a straight line.The worst case scenario is that you make your blade jump out of one of your wheels and injure yourself. So you need something supporting your blade on the back side, keepin' it steady against your incoming timber.\nNow picture that you wanted to make a tight-curved cut with that saw. Having your blade running inside that kerf it made on your piece of timber, you'd start twisting that, therefore also twisting your blade. And you don't want that either! What could we do about that? We could also support the blade sideways, left and right...\nNow those things I just mentioned, are exaclty what a blade guide is meant to do! It supports your blade from both the back and the sides, to provide you a better result, while keeping you safe. And you could make them in a whole lot of different ways, but there are is a thing that remains in common. The lower blade guide is stationary, while the upper one is adjustable in height.\nNow I won't get too much into the details, cause like I said, there are a ton of ways to do that, and they are all right if they can provide you the support needed. But you can find a video here on how I made mine, and who knows, maybe you also go that way! They are working like a charm..", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FA4/6XFR/JPINY1ZY/FA46XFRJPINY1ZY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS9/6F7Z/JPINY1ZZ/FS96F7ZJPINY1ZZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Safety First! (a.k.a Bladeguides..)"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Last thing before we give it a paintjob, is to make a cover for all the moving parts that we are not gonna use. That means the whole saw, except those 18 cm of your resaw height!\nI mostly used scrap plywood pieces of 8 mm thickness, and a little piece of (also scrap) 19 mm thick pine board. I used my table saw (which is an inverted circular saw) to rip cut them at a widht of arround 4.5 cm, which is just enough to clear my wheels and their shafts. Then, placing each piece where it had to go around the body of my bandsaw, I measured that and cut it to lenght using the bandsaw itself. This went pretty fast!\nAlso on some pieces I had to make notches for clearing my blade, my bladeguides and the brackets that I used to mount the body on the base, which I also did using the bandsaw. After I had all my pieces ready, I applied glue and clamped them in place, two or three of them at a time. I don't own as many F-clamps as I'd like! A while later I had the whole structure ready, on which I applied glue on the outer side, and threw up there a piece of 4 mm plywood board. Once dried, I used my trim router, with a flush cut endmill (the one that is flush with the bearing on the bottom) to trim any piece of that plywood sticking out of my cover's structure, and that was all! Mounted that in place, shimming it with some folded paper on the lower side ( so it won't rub), found two big enough hinges and screwed them in place. You could also use a piano hinge for that, or whatever you have in hand. Don't sweat it!\nAnd now for the paint! But before we go there...\nAs you make have noticed, I also make youtube videos regarding some of my makes. This bandsaw we are talking about here, is one of those makes. And it took rather long! To be accurate it ended up being a four-part video series, and by the time I was about to paint this thing, I had already released some of those parts. On one of those videos, a viewer of mine, mr John, wrote a saying in the comments that went like this:\n\"Rust never sleeps, gravity is always waiting, blades are watching your eyes\".\nNow that's a cool saying, isn't it?? That's what I thought, so I also thought I should engrave it some place on this little bandsaw! I was thinking of also adding a round window above the upper wheel, on which I would draw a spiral. The thing is already turning! Let's take advantage of that and make it look cool...\nSo I went ahead and made a rough round whole on my saw's cover, aproximately where my upper wheel sits. Then I grabed a piece of 8 mm thick plywood and went for my CNC machine (also handmade, on which you can find an instructable here..) There I cut a ring (or two half-rings to be more accurate!) which also included John's saying we talked about. Once ready, I used the bandsaw to cut them apart from the rest of the board, and I also used that to cut a round piece of 3mm thick plexi-glass (salvaged from a screen). Using the router I made a rabbet in the inner-back part of the ring, and using some CA glue, I mounted the plexiglass in place assembling the whole window structure. Then I mounted that on the saw's cover and around the whole I made, simply by screwing it in place from the inside.\nAs for paint, there is really not much to talk about! It's reccomended to paint your new tool, or use some varnish in order to seal the wood, making it harder to get dirty, much easier to clean, and prevent it for absorbing moisture and warping too much. The color is up to you!\nRegarding electronics, I used a switch to turn the saw on and off, which I mounted on the front side of the cover, and wired it to control the 12 Volts coming from my power supply, right before powering up my motor. I tie-wraped the hadrill's trigger pressed and I also wired some 25V 4700uF capacitors in parallel with my power supply's output, in order to make things a bit easier when powering up the bandsaw.\nAnd now the thing is ready! And working like a charm! You can check it out on the video embeded above, or here, and if it meets your expectations, go make one for yourself!\nAnd I believe thats all for this time folks!\nUntill the next one, thank you all for being here, and if you like what you see, feel free to follow me here on istructables, or my yt channel. See you next time, with another make!\nTake care, and cut safely!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FB0/99D8/JPINY1Y2/FB099D8JPINY1Y2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1G/AG2S/JPINY1ZO/F1GAG2SJPINY1ZO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZJ/1AL8/JPINY1Y9/FZJ1AL8JPINY1Y9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIN/DTTE/JPINY1XY/FINDTTEJPINY1XY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR1/ZPUQ/JPINY1XX/FR1ZPUQJPINY1XX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWS/4HYE/JPINY1WJ/FWS4HYEJPINY1WJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJT/58X8/JPINY1WE/FJT58X8JPINY1WE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX6/92WQ/JPINY1WA/FX692WQJPINY1WA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVQ/3KV1/JPINY1W9/FVQ3KV1JPINY1W9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWU/Q58P/JPINY1W8/FWUQ58PJPINY1W8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL2/BURV/JPINY1W7/FL2BURVJPINY1W7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF8/OXHP/JPINY1S2/FF8OXHPJPINY1S2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNU/MSJR/JPINY1QO/FNUMSJRJPINY1QO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1D/EB7I/JPINY1NS/F1DEB7IJPINY1NS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU4/WDCZ/JPINY1NP/FU4WDCZJPINY1NP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4W/0DME/JPINY1NU/F4W0DMEJPINY1NU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHN/C595/JPINY1NO/FHNC595JPINY1NO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F15/CY0X/JPINY1NE/F15CY0XJPINY1NE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F95/6KDP/JPINY1NM/F956KDPJPINY1NM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC2/3H0I/JPINY1NB/FC23H0IJPINY1NB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFW/4ZEY/JPINY18D/FFW4ZEYJPINY18D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7P/KYTY/JPINY1NV/F7PKYTYJPINY1NV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FID/A0PA/JPINY19Q/FIDA0PAJPINY19Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJM/AK6J/JPINY1GF/FJMAK6JJPINY1GF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOZ/R940/JPINY1KI/FOZR940JPINY1KI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQS/6NTH/JPINY1LV/FQS6NTHJPINY1LV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXE/83EH/JPINY1J4/FXE83EHJPINY1J4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4Q/TIN2/JPINY1J5/F4QTIN2JPINY1J5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSJ/95MG/JPINY1N9/FSJ95MGJPINY1N9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHP/UDMZ/JPINY16Z/FHPUDMZJPINY16Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVK/CDW3/JPINY1N8/FVKCDW3JPINY1N8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Finallizing!

Some of them don't hold onto their old shoes and some others won't have any when you contact them, but don't get discouraged! Often even if they don't have any horseshoes to give you, they can put you in touch with one of their farriers (The people who trim horse hooves and put horseshoes on), many of whom have hundreds of shoes they will happily give you, especially if you tell them a bit about what you're doing with them. One farrier offered to fill my pickup bed with horseshoes if I came to him in the spring. I might have to take him up on that offer if I keep coming up with so many ideas to use them for.\nIf you're just going to be making a small project like this, it should be pretty easy to find a handful of shoes. If (when) you get hooked on horseshoes and start making more from them, you'll want to get out there and build up a relationship with a few of the ranches and farriers. You might even convince them to deliver right to your door in exchange for the occasional finished product that you make. Hey, you might even make a good friend!\nThe only small issue with getting used shoes is that they won't all be the same size. You may have to sort through the box a little bit to find similar-sized ones depending on the project, but for this one you can use various sizes. You'll also typically have to clean them up a bit. For those who don't want to go through that effort -or don't have a ranch around-, Tractor Supply (in the U.S.) or most any farm supply store should stock new ones for $2-3 each.\nYou can also find new and used horseshoes on eBay and Amazon, but be careful! You want to buy solid steel shoes, not cast iron. Cast metals have many small pores that can trap gasses and cause the metal to shatter when they get heated during welding. It's worth paying a few extra dollars to be sure they won't blow up in your face.\nOn a side note, I found a handful of aluminum (Aluminium for you folks across the big lake) horseshoes mixed in with one batch I got. I've never welded with aluminum but I'm hoping to make something special from them.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0T/SX5L/JP8Z6PWD/F0TSX5LJP8Z6PWD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGJ/HW03/JP8Z6PWE/FGJHW03JP8Z6PWE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Get Yourself Some Shoes!"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "If you bought brand new shoes, you may be able to skip to the next step. Though often new horseshoes will have mill scale on them that you will want to remove before welding.\nStart by removing any nails left in the shoes. Most can get pulled out with a pair of pliers, but some will need a few good whacks with a hammer. You can save the nails for other projects if you wish.\nSome of the shoes from one ranch still had the rubber pads tacked on the bottoms, and I had to grind off the rivet holding them on before the pad would come off.\nThe next move is to get the gunk and junk out of the shoe. The easiest and most effective way I've found to do this is with a good sandblaster. This strips most of the rust off at the same time as getting the packed pasture crud out and giving the shoe a nice even finish.\nI'm still hoping Santa will bring me a sandblaster for Christmas, but since I don't have it yet I have to borrow my brother's when I can. When I'm at home I typically use a wire wheel. The wheel I have is air powered, but a benchtop wheel would work just as well if not easier. It isn't quite as effective as the sandblaster, but fairly simple and a lot of hobbyists already have wire wheels. Make sure to wear respiratory protection for either method, there will be a lot of powderized dirt and crud in the air that you really don't want in your lungs.\nIf you don't have either of those tools, don't worry! You can always clean up your horseshoes with a steel brush and a metal pick. Just be prepared to put some elbow grease into it!\nNOTE: This Christmas tree I made with some new shoes that were mixed in when I was given the old ones.

If you're using old shoes, you'll want 2 shoes that are close to the same size to use for the base, and 3 that can be slightly different sizes.

I was curious to compare working with new shoes as opposed to old ones, but there didn't seem to be a whole lot of difference.\nCut 2 of the shoes in half at the top. Cut a third one (the small one if they're different sizes) a little off-center. The first one I made I cut a little too close to centered for my liking, so I cut off another small section later on the mark you see in the pictures. If you cut close to the top of the slots that the nails go into it should be just right (see pictures).\nI ground the intersecting edges slightly concave to contour better to the shoe they'll be welded too.

I then welded the 2 shoes together for the base and tacked the upright section onto it. That was the fun part, I was reaching over my roommate's head to hold the upright section and trying to keep it vertical while looking the opposite direction so I wouldn't be blinded as he welded it. We could have used a 90\u00b0 magnet or even just a few pieces of scrap to make a brace, but that would have been too simple!\nIf you remember from my last 'Ible with the horseshoe heart, my roommate has a TIG welder but wouldn't let anyone else touch it. I must have won his trust a little bit, because now he's letting me use it a little bit myself.

So I made a bigger one (see photo 5).\nTrace the star you choose onto a piece of scrap plate, then cut it out. You can use the same angle grinder wheel you used for cutting the horseshoes.

Masking tape is great as it has no residue when you pull it off and leaves a nice even surface.\nBefore you decide to finish it, take a look at the cool colors around where you welded the horseshoes. I'd like to try out \"marbling\" the whole thing with a torch instead of blasting one of them. (EDIT: I tried marbling a small scrap piece with a propane torch. It took a long time to heat the metal to get even a hint of color change.

First, you have to take apart the entire dashboard as well as take of the mirrors and side doors using a Philips head screwdriver (Make sure to keep track of the screws and where the go, or you might end up with an unfinished vehicle)\n2. Remove the steering wheel from the steering shaft with either a Philips or flathead screwdriver\n3. Locate all of the screws on the bottom side of the steering wheel and remove all screws using a Philips head screwdriver (Put these in a cup or tape roll because you\u2019re going to need these later)\n4. Remove the top of the wheel and look down from the top, you should see 4 more screws\n5. Take a Philips head screwdriver and remove the these 4 screws (We will no longer need these, but you can hold onto them if you would like)\n6. Take out the center plastic steering shaft\n7. Take 4, 2\" long metal rods and make them concentric with each other (Just put the rods in the holes)\n8. From the underside of the steering wheel, use a Philips head screwdriver and remove the 2 red buttons (We are doing this to make sure that the connections are soldered well)\n9. Check both sides to make sure that the wires are soldered well and are not falling off (Ours were, so we had to re-solder the connection)\n10. Reconnect the buttons with the screws that you removed previously\n11. Use a Dremel tool to sand away a little of the plastic button to make room for the buttons to move (Your buttons might be \u201csticky\u201d so doing this will cause them to be depressed easier)\n12. Next get a piece of \u00bc inch scrap wood that is roughly 3 inches wide and 3 inches in length\n13. Trace the shape of the top of the steering shaft and mark the 4 holes on the wood (This way when we cut it out, we can keep the shape as close to perfect as we can for an exact fit)\n14. Use a band saw, or jig saw, and cut the outline of the wooden shape out\n15. Then use the drill press and drill xxxxxxxx inch holes in the wood where you marked earlier\n16. Now use a size xxxxxxx drill bit to make a hole directly in the middle of the wood, or close to it (Just make sure not to drill into the hole we just made in the previous step)\n17. Sand down the edges using a belt sander, but slowly so your shape doesn\u2019t \u201cdisintegrate\u201d\n18. Take a flat head screwdriver and pop the chrome plastic piece off of the top of the steering wheel\n19. You now want to align the wood to the top of the steering wheel, and use a drill press to drill a hole offset by about a quarter of an inch up and to the right (From the underside of the top piece)\n20. Next take a xxxxxx \u00be inch bolt and secure that to the top of the steering wheel using the same sized nut (This will be used as a spacer)\n21. Run the wires going from both buttons through the large hole in the center\n22. Take the same size nut and secure the wooden piece to the underside of the steering wheel making sure not to secure too tightly so the wood doesn\u2019t crack (This should fit because we removed some of the button as well as some plastic to make room for the wiring as well as this wooden piece)\n23. Now set the top off to the side because we are basically finished with that part\n24. Take the plastic steering shaft and use a xxxxxxx drill bit and drill a hole into the side of the top of the center steering shaft using a drill press (Make sure to go all the way through the center, but not through the bottom)\n25. Put the plastic steering shaft on the 4 metal rods making sure to align the correct holes back into place (Look at the orientation of the plastic steering shaft from the top, the big hole goes on top)\n26. Take the xxxxxxxx switch that we wired in the previous step and run it through the larger hole in bottom of the steering shaft to the top (You want it to sit on the top, and you want the lever to be pointed towards the center)\n27. Use two small zip ties, one at a time, and run the zip ties through the holes that you drilled in the previous step and through the small holes in the xxxxxxx switch and around the outside, and then through the end of the zip tie (It does not matter which zip tie size you use, as long as it fits through the holes in the xxxxxxx switch and fits snuggly in the drilled holes)\n28. When tightening the zip ties, go slow so you can readjust the xxxxxxxx switch if it moves\n29. Put the steering shaft on metal rods in the correct orientation (You\u2019ll know based on if the large hole is towards the top of the steering wheel)\n30. Take 2 springs that are the same length as the rods and put them on the 2 rods on the left and right side of the steering wheel (Use what ever springs you like, but just remember it\u2019s just a small kid, maybe with a disability and they are weaker at pushing)\n31. Hot glue the button wires to the right underside of the wood (Opposite side of the xxxxxxxxx switch, this will prevent interference, and make it so the wood is what activates the xxxxxxx switch)\n32. Hold it tightly together, making sure that the xxxxxx switch isn\u2019t activated, if it is, readjust the insides such as removing the spacer from earlier, or use a smaller one\n33. Once everything is in the clear, get the button wires through the big hole in the bottom of the steering shaft\n34. Get those screws that you set off on the side from the first few steps we did, and use a Philips head screwdriver to put them all back into place\n35. Stick the wires from the bottom of the steering wheel through the hole where the metal steering is sitting\n36. Attach the speaker wires to the wires that go to the buttons\n37. Turn on the vehicle to make sure that everything in the steering wheel was wired correctly before securing everything down\n38.

We used the X-Carve CNC to create some really awesome shapes on all the sides of our alphabet blocks.\nEach cube was going to have 2 letters, 2 animals, 1 number and 1 skull. For the animals, we found a really nice pack of animal vector art that we purchased and then in Adobe Illustrator we edited and simplified the artwork to customize it to exactly what we wanted.\nFrom there, the vector art gets imported into the Easel software for the X-Carve and we can move it around and size it appropriately for our 9\" square pieces. The animals were carved to a depth of 1/8\".\nWe used a 'V-Groove' bit for the carving, which, instead of a flat line gives you a really interesting V-style edge. It's also nice because it comes to a perfectly fine tip and is ideal for carves with a lot of small detail.\nSince we wanted to paint the inside of the carved lines but leave the face of the wood unpainted, we used blue painter's tape to mask off the entire thing and then let the machine cut away the areas that would be painted.\nEach animal took about 30 minutes to carve. We ended up carving:\nAlligator (A)\nBear (B)\nChameleon (C)\nJaguar (J)\nOctopus (O)\nYeti (Y)\nWe chose A, B, and C because they're classic for this project and we chose J, O, and Y because with that combination of 6 letters we could spell the baby's initials and a good number of other words.\nAlso, our friend thinks Bigfoot and Yetis are real...so it seemed like the perfect choice. ;)\nCarving the Letters & Numbers\nWe also carved the corresponding letters for each animal by using three layers of cut depths in Easel. The lowest layer was a large square set to 3/8\" deep. The middle layer was a series of stripes on top of the bottom layer that lay across the middle set to 1/8\" depth, and then on top, we put the letter itself but set the cut depth to zero. This \"cancels out\" the carving in that area, so the letters are actually left alone while the space around them gets cut away. Really cool technique!\nThe numbers were really simple. We cut them all at a single depth of 1/8\" and each carve took about 60 seconds each.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FT0/KKD6/JPIO0TME/FT0KKD6JPIO0TME.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGE/NCN4/JPIO0T29/FGENCN4JPIO0T29.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F10/XPWE/JPIO0T27/F10XPWEJPIO0T27.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC8/F5YB/JPIO0T28/FC8F5YBJPIO0T28.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0B/07CY/JPIO0T2C/F0B07CYJPIO0T2C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR8/UD5K/JPIO0T2D/FR8UD5KJPIO0T2D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBX/AXD2/JPIO0T32/FBXAXD2JPIO0T32.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXT/GFOT/JPIO0T36/FXTGFOTJPIO0T36.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0O/I79A/JPIO0T3A/F0OI79AJPIO0T3A.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Carving the Designs!"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "For the cube to go together, we cut miter joints on the inside of all 6 pieces that would all come together as the cube is assembled.

A stop block on the fence helps us to cut all of them at exactly the same length.\nBefore cutting all 72, we did some test fits using blue tape to ensure the blocks would go together, and it worked!\nOnce the testing was done, we cut all the miters and it didn't take long at all.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F32/15IT/JPIO0T3E/F3215ITJPIO0T3E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS5/V4GD/JPIO0T3P/FS5V4GDJPIO0T3P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKB/4BBC/JPIO0T3W/FKB4BBCJPIO0T3W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK2/YUWK/JPIO0T49/FK2YUWKJPIO0T49.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F79/S9X5/JPIO0T4D/F79S9X5JPIO0T4D.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Cutting the Miters!"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "With all the prep we did, the painting was super simple!

There's more detail here in the video, but essentially we set the tool to its 45-degree setting and then we aligned the biscuit joiner on a T-stop clamped to the bench and aligned the workpiece to the same edge. We cut all 4 slots on one side, then moved both the tool and the workpiece to the opposite side of the T-stop and repeated the process. This helped us cut 144 biscuit slots in about 10 minutes.

From there we marked each side so they didn't get mixed up and then flipped them over so the bottom was facing up.\nSince there's a lot of surface area to glue up in a short time, we used a glue roller to apply the glue along the miters. One trick we like to use is to roll blue tape around the roller, which can be removed later and allows us to use the same roller many times without the glue ruining it on first use.\nUsing non-toxic wood glue, we rolled it across all 24 surfaces, inserted biscuits with a bit of glue on them into each slot, and then slowly put the cube together all at once.

This made it so that when we assembled the cubes not all of the corners came together perfectly.\nNo big deal though we can use wood filler for this. But...wood filler is very toxic and gross and we don't want the baby to eat it. So, we used a wood glue and sawdust mixture, created a slurry and rubbed it into each of the corners where there was a gap. This works just like a wood filler but is non-toxic, dries the same color as the wood, and is incredibly easy to make and use. Also, it's free because you have sawdust all over the place. :)\nBefore applying the sawdust filler, we went to the router table and used a round-over bit set to about half its depth. This rounded over all of the corners \"halfway\" which was enough to expose the corners so we could easily fill them. Once the sawdust mixture was dry, we went back to the router table and repeated the round over but at the full depth.\nIf we had filled the corners prior to doing any rounding over, we might not have gone deep enough and may have still had gaps once we rounded the corners over later. Similarly, if we had rounded them over entirely, we'd have to do it again to clean up the excess filler once it dried.

I used a hand held coping saw but you can use whatever you have. Basswood is super soft so it wont take you long at all.\nAfter the body was cut from the basswood, it was really rough and full of saw marks. First I sanded around the outside with a Dremel tool fitted with a small sanding drum. You certainly wouldn't have to do this but it sped up the process of cleaning up the saw marks.\nIf you are familiar with the Stratocaster shape, you are aware of the part on the back and the other area on the front that is sanded down a bit more (see fig). I've learned that Fender calls this the \"Comfort Contour Body\" If you were wondering. If you are making this or any other model, be aware of these features.\nAfter I sanded down those areas with the Dremel, I switched to hand sanding with 180 grit. Look closely at images of the guitar you are recreating. The Stratocaster has nice rounded edges all the way around the front and back. Everything is really smooth. Use the 180 grit to model those features. Spend some time on this. Even though the basswood is soft, this part is really important.

The Exacto blade cuts right through the wood going along the grain. Use caution here though because it splits REALLY easy. I suggest making all your cross cuts first. I split the first 3 I made and it might take you one or two to get it right as well.

Place it on top of the neck you cut out and use the red lines to mark where the frets are placed on the fret board. Also use your Exacto knife to make tiny marks where the tuning pegs go. Just poke the blade through the paper and into the head just a tiny bit. Then use your Dremel tool and a 1/32 drill bit to make the holes for the tuning pegs, being careful not to drill all the way through (but if you do, its not too terrible. You can fix it.)\nUse your diagonal pliers (or side cutter) to cut 6 pieces of wire from your beading needles or whatever wire you chose to use for the tuning pegs. Cut these to about 1/2 inch. I put each of mine in the Dremel and used a small file to remove the sharp points after cutting them. You want these to be smooth. You could also just sand them down with sandpaper or just the file if you'd like. Then cut the rough end down so that when you put them into the hole you just drilled, they stick out about 1/8 of an inch. Test fit these before gluing.\nAfter you have the tuning pegs in, check to make sure they are even. If any of them stick out too far, you can just press them in farther. The wood is soft enough for this.\nTo prepare the neck to receive the frets, use a razor blade to cut a tiny slot where each fret will be placed. This doesn't have to be too deep. Frets stick above the neck anyways, so this slot is just a spot for the frets to sit and somewhere for the glue to adhere. Put a tiny bit of superglue on a small stick pin and glue one in each slot. Use something hard to press them into each of the slots. The glue will quickly soak into the wood, so after it dries enough to hold in there, put another bead of glue across each fret. I did the several times so that the frets were almost coated with glue. This may take you a few times. Some will fall out immediately and some will fall out in further steps. Just be patient with it and if they come out, just glue them back in.\nWhen the glue has dried thoroughly (preferably over night) cut the extra wire off both sides with your side cutter.

This can be either the easiest or the hardest part of the project, depending on where you live.\nThe best way to acquire a whole bunch of used ones is to ask around with local ranches, who will often direct you to their farriers (the people who put horseshoes on). The farriers usually have plenty that they will gladly give to you. The first one I asked laughed and asked how big my truck was... He said he could get me 5,000 in the spring if I wanted them!\nI was hoping to start on this project sooner than that, so I went to Facebook (A great reliable resource for everything, especially opinions) and found about 2 dozen ranches and stables around the area. I took about 20 minutes to call and message them to ask if they had any old horseshoes they would be willing to contribute to my experiments. Of the 23 that I contacted, 4 didn't answer the phone after calling a few times throughout the week, 1 had the wrong number listed on their site, 8 of them said they didn't keep their horseshoes around, 3 said they had just given big piles of them to someone else that welds with them, 2 said that they sold their old shoes for $3 each (new ones are typically around $2.50 around here..), and 1 of them was visiting Argentina for 3 months!\nDon't get discouraged if you get turned down a few times. Of the 4 places that did have some shoes around that they were willing to give out, 2 of them only had a few horseshoes, BUT the 2 other ones each gave me more than 20 shoes each and were only a few miles away, and one of the ranches that only had a couple gave me contact info for their farrier. I called him and he said he had just recently given away most of his shoes, but had a few left that he could just about drop on my doorstep as he was driving past later in the week. \"A few left\" turned out to be almost 40 shoes! He also said he could bring me plenty more once I was through with these ones. I see a few more horseshoe projects coming in the near future!\nIf you're just going to be making one small project from horseshoes, it should be pretty easy to find a handful of shoes. If (when) you get hooked on horseshoes and start making more from them, you'll want to build up a relationship with your shoe supplier. You might even convince them to deliver to you in exchange for the occasional finished product that you make. Hey, you might even make a good friend.\nThe only thing with getting used shoes is that they won't all be the same size, and you have to sort through the box a little to find similar-sized ones for some projects. You'll also typically have to clean them up a bit. For those who don't want to go through that effort -or don't have a ranch around-, Tractor Supply (in the U.S.) or most any farm supply store should stock new ones for a few dollars each.\nYou can also find new and used horseshoes on eBay and Amazon, but be careful! You want to buy solid steel shoes, not cast iron. Cast metals have many small pores that can trap gasses and cause the metal to shatter when heated. Don't use those!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9K/AEVJ/JP8ZDYGH/F9KAEVJJP8ZDYGH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Git Some Shoes!"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "If you bought new shoes, you can probably skip this step. Though sometimes new horseshoes will have rough mill scale on them that you will want to remove before welding.\nFor everyone like me who wanted to reuse old ones, you'll want to clean them up before getting started.\nStart by removing any nails left in the shoes. Most can get pulled out with a pair of pliers, but some will need a few good whacks with a hammer. You can save the nails for other projects if you want.\nSome of the shoes from one ranch still had the rubber pads (what's the official name of them?) tacked on the bottoms, and I had to cut off the rivet holding them on.\nThe next move is to get the gunk and junk out of the shoe. The easiest and most effective way I've seen this done is with a good sandblaster. This strips most of the rust off at the same time as getting the packed pasture crud out and giving the shoe a nice matte finish.\nThe second powered method that I typically use is a wire wheel. I use an air powered one, but a benchtop wheel would work as well. It's not quite as effective as the sandblaster, but fairly simple and a lot of shops already have wire wheels. Make sure to wear respiratory protection for either method, there will be a lot of dirt and crud thrown around that you really don't want in your lungs.\nIf you don't have either of the above tools, don't worry! You can always clean up your horseshoes with some steel wool or steel brush and a pick tool.

A bandsaw with a blade for cutting metal works equally as well.\nIn order to get closer to a nice heart shape, set out the 4 parts on the table overlapping to make a heart, then mark and cut at the intersection points. (See photos)\nGrind down the cut edges so they sit flush. This isn't necessary but it helps later to not have gaps when welding.\nI didn't take pictures of this step for the first heart that I made, so these are from the second one. My first one I cut both top pieces to a flat edge instead of just the one (See photo 3).\nSet out your shoe bits to check how they sit together.

Go to any hardware store and take your head to. We want to find a handle that is in proportion to the head and one that has a good fit. If it is little tight that it ok as we need a good fit to keep the head in. Don't forget to get a shim; a small wedge of wood that locks the handle in place.\nI am planning on engraving the handle. You can too! get a piece of paper and get inspired. Mine has a Fox theme but yours can be anything.. even just plain.\nWith that done it is time to sand the handle. There is a sticker on mine and you have to get that off including the glue or you will ruin many sheets of sandpaper. Scrape off that thing then use a gunk remover. I use Goof Off as it melts that stuff off. Now most handles have a varnish on it and that has to go too. I used 80 grit sand paper and went at it hard. The varnish goes surprisingly deep so it does take a while. I usually take 45 minutes of scrubbing all over to get that off. Make sure you get every last bit. Then take your trusty 180 grit and go over the axe again. This will smooth over the wood and make it feel silky smooth. That takes 20 minutes at least. one good thing to do is open the slot at the top. The slot is always too small. I used my wood cutting wheel to open it by 2/16 of an inch. Nt mush but it will help immensely.\nAfter all that take a wet rag and clean your handle. You can see spots that still have varnish on them so you can go back and sand again and as a plus you can see the grain of the wood and it gives you an idea of what the final product will look like.\nNow get a pencil and start to doodle. Pencil works great and any marks come off great with an eraser. Do what you feel. I like my doodles and hope it works out.

To make lubing it an easy task, I decided to add a grease zerk to each steering spindle.", "title": "Greaseable Steering Joint for 24v Grave Digger Power Wheels", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Greaseable-Steering-Joint-for-24v-Grave-Digger-Pow/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I had a handful of new and used grease zerks in my shop parts bin, so I decided to use them for this project.

There was some sort of epoxy or glue in there with the wood making it very had to remove. I had to use a 2 kg hammer and drill the handle full of holes to finally remove it. No doubt that was effective, yet ugly way of putting a handle on. I will however go with something more elegant.\nI started by filing the edge and the bent corners of the axe head nice and square. I used a file to be more precise and to not remove too only the minimum material. I sharpened the edge roughly and tried to reshape the ruined edge as best as I could without changing the angle of the blade too much. I could have also used an angle grinder for the corners as after taking the surface rust off with a scouring pad I noticed there were some dents which I wanted to remove to get a nicer looking finish. Sometimes I enjoy having a rough texture with high polish like in some hand forged kitchen knives but this time I wanted to go for a mirror finish.\nI decided to use a sanding disk on an angle grinder to remove as little material as I could, being very careful around the makers mark not to damage it. After removing the dents I changed to use rougher and finer scouring pad disks. They alone yielded to a nice finish but to get the best possible result a polishing compound and a polishing wheel was needed. I used one on a drill press as the is easier for me because I can face the axe head in my hand instead of putting it in the vise. My vise has teeth and it's always a little tricky to put anything in there without leaving teeth marks. I also used the polishing wheel to take the edge from sharp to razor sharp. Just a few passes on the wheel will be enough if you have pre-sharpened the edge with a file properly. There were some minor flaws still int the polished surface. I will find a finer sanding wheel for next polishing project as that should get me to the perfect mirror finish.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FG9/LR84/JP8NTU00/FG9LR84JP8NTU00.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBO/OSHI/JP8NTRZO/FBOOSHIJP8NTRZO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQA/JC7S/JP8NTTHC/FQAJC7SJP8NTTHC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZA/PU52/JP8NTTBW/FZAPU52JP8NTTBW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPN/TXOG/JP8NTTDS/FPNTXOGJP8NTTDS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F96/82DW/JP8NTTE5/F9682DWJP8NTTE5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO2/VCUD/JP8NTTEI/FO2VCUDJP8NTTEI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR2/WZBC/JP8NTTGE/FR2WZBCJP8NTTGE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F88/2QQF/JP8NTTI4/F882QQFJP8NTTI4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFS/0HAU/JP8NTTF1/FFS0HAUJP8NTTF1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F22/9GLV/JP8NTTGZ/F229GLVJP8NTTGZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3Z/UIBB/JP8NTTJ4/F3ZUIBBJP8NTTJ4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Cleaning Up the Head and Sharpening the Edge"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I decided to use a local \"waste\" ash my dad had found for the handle. It was found from a local city \"waste wood yard\" where they dump chopped down threes to be burned in a powerplant or something. Usually there is just pine so it is not as wasteful as it sounds.\nI used my dads giant band saw to cut a board out of the block and let it dry before continuing to the handle making. I had drawn a rough sketch on the handle I wanted on cardboard so I merely traced that on the wood and cut a VERY rough piece of wood out. I wanted the piece of wood to still have some adjustment room so that I could adjust the handle a bit if I put the head on in a slightly wrong angle. I started by shaping the wood so that it fits to the eye. After I had a close fit I split the top of the handle on a band saw. I usually make the split quite far down but I think you should leave 1/4 of the height of the axe head \"unsplitted\". Now you should be able to fit the head to the handle. best way to fit the handle is by putting the head on, turning the head pointing down and pounding the bottom of the handle with a mallet. Due to slowness of mass this will drive the handle deep in to the eye. You should leave a little of the handle coming you from the top of the axe head. This will help with putting the wedge in and to secure the head in it's place.\nAfter I was happy with the fit I took the head off once more. You may have to hammer it with scrap 2x4 or something which doesn't ruin the polish, if it is already very tightly fit. After this I used an angle gringer to shape the rest of the handle. Be careful with the removal of material as you can't put it back and the angle grinder will eat it away quite effectively. After I had the rough shape I wanted I put a flap sander on a drill and finished the surface with that.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9Z/B636/JP8NTTK4/F9ZB636JP8NTTK4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7Y/I6DM/JP8NTTLA/F7YI6DMJP8NTTLA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6E/J2B1/JP8NTTMH/F6EJ2B1JP8NTTMH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOZ/ZULK/JP8NTTNS/FOZZULKJP8NTTNS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCO/ACL4/JP8NTTO4/FCOACL4JP8NTTO4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGY/LLOW/JP8NTTO7/FGYLLOWJP8NTTO7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLC/C264/JP8NTTOG/FLCC264JP8NTTOG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTA/D2O1/JP8NTTOY/FTAD2O1JP8NTTOY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Shaping the Handle"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "After I was happy with the handle I sawed a wedge from scrap wood (I think it was oak). the wedge should preferably be too long than too short and it should be very thin from the end so you can easily drive it between the halves of the handle. I recommend getting the surface as smooth as possible to reduce the friction then hammering it in. Always remember to cut the wedge so that the grain is going parallel with the handle, otherwise it will break before you get it deep enough.\nWhen fitting the handle I often use a chisel to open up the split a little and pour some wood glue in to lock the wedge in place. Then you just put the wedge in there and start gently hammering it and once it stars going in hammer it as deep as it goes. On the video I only show hammering it in a vise. Actually I eventually put the bottom of the handle on a floor and hammered it in against it. The axe was sliding down in the vise as I hammered, which meant all the energy was not going to pushing the wedge deeper in. You can also see I put a small \"second wedge\" in after the first one. This was just a small piece of the handle which came off when I was shaping it and I wanted to put it back in its place. As unintentional as it was, it really made the top of the handle look awesome!\nAfter the wood had dried I cut of the excess wood from the top and finished the whole handle with linseed oil. It really made the grain pop. It's quite nice to see a local grown city tree to be turned into something like this. Thank you all for taking the time to read this instructable.

And over the years they have all had a mix of indoor life and outdoor life. In the beginning they were all outside dogs. After my wife and I got married we spent three years in an apartment. This past July things changed again as we purchased our first house together. This means a lot of really great things in life including our dogs getting to run around and play in a fenced in back yard all day. We have never seen our dogs as happy as they are being able to have free run of a yard. So that leads me to this week\u2019s project. They had a 12\u2032 square covered porch to take shelter from the rain and sun but they didn\u2019t have a dog house. Time to make a dog house.\nI didn\u2019t want just any old boring traditional dog house. I wanted to add a little personal touch to it and design something that would somewhat match the theme of our house. Our house has an inviting front porch with tan vinyl siding and green shutters. I designed the dog house to have a front porch of it\u2019s own and similar colors of our house. While the front porch is pretty much a cosmetic touch our smallest dog does use it as a porch now that the dog house is completed which is pretty cute.\nI also made a step by step, highly detailed set of plans for this particular dog house. The first step was to cut the plywood. Three sheets of 3/4\u201d plywood were to be used for the actual structure of the dog house.

Because the roof has a decent slope to it most all of the water will wick away pretty well. Cedar is the first choice that many people will think of right off the bat but after pricing out the materials it was way over budget for me. It\u2019s probably a regional thing but I couldn\u2019t find a decent price even when I thought about using cedar fence pickets. I ended up using Southern Yellow Pine (SYP). SYP is actually a really dense wood that has a high resin content and was only one third the cost of cedar. I used 1\u00d76 boards cut to 9\u201d lengths. Each 9\u201d length was then resawn along the diagonal to yield two triangular shingles.\nAnd then each individual shingle was dipped into a gallon of oil based stain to not only give the color I was going for but also to seal the wood and offer a little more protection from the rain. The dimensions of the roof called for 8 rows of shingles per side with each row containing 10 shingles. That was 160 (plus a few extra) shingles to dip and brush.

Anyway, I went with about ten pallets, and I ended up with quite a lot of surplus, which was nice because I could discard a lot of boards that were bent or that contained too many imperfections.\nOnce you bring them back, you will want to organize them by type of wood and thickness of the boards, it will come important later.\nTL;DR: Find old wood pallets for free if you can.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F50/MSU6/JP6TMOWZ/F50MSU6JP6TMOWZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEI/U2E5/JP6TMOX0/FEIU2E5JP6TMOX0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F07/WJPX/JP6TMOX1/F07WJPXJP6TMOX1.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Find Free Wood Pallets Online"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "At this point you have two choices: you can either take apart the boards of the pallets and remove all the nails and end up with 30-40 inches segments or you can simply cut them between where they are nailed and end up with 12 to 16 inches segments.

In the end it took about 1 to 2 hours and I needed to change my battery twice. You will want to keep them organised as they were before as to not mix different type of woods and thickness together.\nI then took the resulting boards and cut the ends straight with a miter saw.

Well, I choose this amount because a few of my clamps didn't extend more than 6 inches. Don't be afraid to discard boards that are to bent or that have to many imperfections. It is ok if you didn't cut your board exactly to the same thickness on the table saw earlier, as only one side will show. Be aware as you're gluing them that this side will be the one on the floor as gravity will force it to be more or less even. You can use a rubber hammer as you are clamping your rows to make sure all the boards are flat on the ground. Make your rows longer then the length that you want your tool cabinet workbench to be and try to not align the separtion between two boards in two subsequent rows otherwise it will compromise the structure of your surface. We will cut the exceeding parts later.\nBe mindful of the gaps you can create by using not exactly the same thickness of boards. It's ok to have some but try to keep it to a minimum. It's also here that you can choose the look of the working surface of your tool cabinet workbench. I would recommend to try to alternate between types of wood but to try to keep some randomness in there to make it look more \"organic\".\nOnce your staisfied with the total width of your surface, you will need to glue the sections together. I proceeded to glue two halves of the surface at the time using my larget clamps. Make sure to wait a while for the glue to really dry as you don't want to screw up at this point.\nFinally, to glue the two halves together I had to use straps as my longest clamps were too short by maybe 2 inches wich was unfortunate. The straps ended up working quite well but it tended to make the thing curve upwards so I had to put a lot weight on the sides as it was drying to keep it straight.

While I am planning to build a nice large workbench, the majority of my tools are still boxed up and piled in the center of the space. I decided it made the most sense to build a small work/storage cart that I could get some things stored in and provide a space to work on when I build my full work bench and various wall racks.\nMy only criteria for the cart were that it be mobile, have some different size storage compartments to hold various power tools, and provide a decent space to do some work on top if need be. I settled on the design shown in the pictures. The design consisted of 3 primary spaces: two storage spaces on each side and one larger center chamber. I decided to use 1\" x 2\" lumber from the box store to build four rectangular frames which would provide the basic framework for the cart. I would then attach plywood to the exterior to actually form the cart.\nThis is a pretty straightforward project that even the most novice woodworker/maker can handle. If necessary, this entire project could be built with just a jig saw and drill.\nMaterials:\nChop Saw (https://amzn.to/2P865YE)\nCircular Saw (https://amzn.to/2SfP4xO)\nJigsaw (https://amzn.to/2Qm1EOK)\nDrill/Driver (https://amzn.to/2P4lfOR)\nVarious Size Screws\n1-2 sheets 15/32\" thick plywood\n1 sheet 3/4\" thick plywood\n4 or 5 - 1\" x 2\" x 8' lumber (just cheap pine from the local box store)\nCasters (https://amzn.to/2P485Bm)\nSquare (https://amzn.to/2DPtfkL)\nMeasuring Tape (https://amzn.to/2QlpWZj)\nI used cheap plywood and pine from the local Home Depot and Lowes since this was just intended to be a rough work cart. Obviously, you could get nicer stuff and class things up.

I was making a cart with a width of 24\" and a height of 30\" so those were the numbers I was working with. To make the same design as me you will need 8 sticks each of the two lengths.\nUsing appropriate sized screws (not so large that they split the wood), assemble the skeleton frame. I put two small screws into each miter joint. I found that using a 90 degree clamp (https://amzn.to/2E3Lgg9) to hold the two pieces while screwing was very useful.\nWhen this is done, you should now have 4 picture frame looking things.\nNOTE: Feel free to stop at this point and use these as picture frames, if need be.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FY2/LEWK/JP2Y4ZCJ/FY2LEWKJP2Y4ZCJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9T/A4I1/JP2Y4ZAW/F9TA4I1JP2Y4ZAW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYF/0TSP/JP2Y4ZBW/FYF0TSPJP2Y4ZBW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: The Skeleton"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Now with our four frames made we can go about putting the plywood skin on our cart.

Essentially we are making the sides of the two exterior compartments. I wanted the compartments to be 10\" deep so I cut plywood that was 30\" tall and 10\" wide. Cut four of these pieces (unless you're making the compartments different depths).\nUse 1 1/4\" screws to mount these pieces to the frames you constructed in the previous step. Put as many screws as you feel necessary to get everything nice and tight. You should end up with two different box looking things that only have two sides.\nStep 2: I wanted a shelf in one of the compartments so I cut two small pieces of 1\" x 2\" lumber to fit between the frames (see picture). Cut these with the chop saw and use a measuring tape/level to make sure you get them mounted at the same height.

If you desire or need lighter colored bee's wax, you may want to go on line to order some in bulk. However, I have had good luck with light powders and relatively light wax, even using when buffing very light woods like sycamore.\n1.3 You can also buy beeswax in bulk on line and there are a lot of options.\n2.0 FINE PUMICE STONE\nand/or\nDIATOMACEOUS EARTH -\nand/or\nROTTENSTONE -\nand/or\nCERIUM OXIDE -\n2.1 You do not need all of these powders, unless you want to experiment. I note the commercial versions use both pumice and diatomaceous earth, in the same mix but I haven\u2019t tried the commercial ones, so do not know how they compare in performance. I get excellent results just using the diatomaceous earth. In fact, it has become my go to compound.\n2.2 If you use rottenstone, be aware it is dark, so can be problematic for polishing light woods. It depends on the effect you're trying to achieve. However, it can still be useful for polishing plastics, including poly\u2019s, and lacquer.\n2.3 The pumice I have does not bring as fine a shine to plastics as the diatomaceous earth I used to make my compound.\n2.4 I haven\u2019t tried baking soda, but it and other things, like corn starch and flour, might produce interesting results. Of course, they are cheap and easy to find.\n2.5 The cerium oxide version seems to be the finest of the compounds, but is the most expensive to make using the powders mentioned.\n3.0 Turpentine. 3.1 Keep in mind, you don\u2019t need a large quantity for even a good sized batch.\n3.2 I have not tested using paint thinner, as a replacement for turpentine. It may be it would do fine. As long as it dissolves the beeswax enough so it will mix with the powder, it would be fine.\n3.3 Merely heating the beeswax would be sufficient to allow it to mix with the powder. However, keep in mind beeswax can ignite, so should be heated using a TENDED double boiler, or by sitting the container of wax in boiling water, until it can be mixed with the powder.\nNOTE: If the container is plastic, too much heat will, of course, melt the container. If the container is glass and if it has not been warmed, such as by setting it in hot tap water to warm, placing the container in boiling water is likely to break it.\n4.0 CONTAINER(S)\n4.1 When I went looking for containers to store the mixed compound in, I found prices to be higher than I\u2019d was willing to pay. However, glass containers of shapes that I could both store the compound in and dip a cloth or paper towel in to were readily available at Dollar Stores.

For example, if 3/4 of the wax has melted, just stirring the hotter wax with the cooler wax may melt the rest.\nor\n1.1(b) Use a microwave, BUT LIMIT THE RUN TIME TO 20 SECONDS at a time, and stir the wax between each run. If melted, after stirring, go to the next step. Otherwise, run the wax in the microwave another 20 seconds and stir again, until melted.\n2.0 If you do not want to or cannot melt the beeswax using one of two methods above, place about 1/4 cup of beeswax in your glass or plastic container.\n2.1 Add about a teaspoon of turpentine to the container and mix until the beeswax is the consistency of a thick syrup. Add more turpentine, if needed and mix again.\n2.2 Add about 1/8 cup of cup of your chosen buff powder to the container. And stir until all the powder and beeswax are mixed together and are the consistency of a paste about as thick as or a bit thicker than toothpaste.\nNOTE: Add drops of turpentine or more powder per your preference.

If I have significant chips on the plastic, because, for example, I let my lathe knives get dull, I may have to start out with 100 grit. From there, I jump over 120 to 150, then to 180 or even 220 and, finally, to the 320.\n1.4 Interestingly, though the sanding goes quickly doing it as described in the previous paragraph, it can go even quicker by going through the following sequence of grits: 100, 120, 150, 180, 220, then 320.\n1.5 When sanding, USE A LIGHT TOUCH, and keep moving around on both the piece you are sanding and on the sandpaper.\n1.6 For each finer grit, wipe the piece off (grit left from the previous paper can contaminate the finer grit), then sand until the sand marks from the previous grit are gone.\n1.7 When using my buffer, I use a soft, spiral sewn wheel, to which I apply a bit of the compound, spread around the wheel.\n1.8 Keep moving the piece around as you buff it or you will melt the plastic and will end up with polished dimples and grooves.\n1.9 When polishing on the lathe, use an old cotton T-shirt, a blue paper (shop) towel, or a micro fiber cloth to hold a generous daub of your buff compound.\nNOTE: An advantage of the paper towels is, there are no threads that can be grabbed by the lathe or the piece. Regardless what you use, don\u2019t wrap it around your finger so, if it gets caught, you will not be injured. That said, a micro-fiber cloth seems to do an even nicer job of polishing than the paper towel or T-shirt. Just avoid the ends of the item, where it is most likely to get caught.\n1.10.1 Press the compound laden part of the cloth or towel against the project piece and keep it moving.\n1.10.2 You\u2019ll notice the piece change sheen very quickly.

I lightly sanded the loose debris away from the live edge while careful not to damage it.\nThe edge opposite from the live edge was already straight from my previous project. Next, I squared one side of the cypress wood with my miter saw. I flipped the wood over and squared the other side. Keep in mind, I didn\u2019t need to do square each end.

The packing tape prevents the resin from adhering to the plywood. Furthermore, furniture wax (or vaseline) serves as a release agent and makes the wood and resin beach art easy to remove.\nI repeated this process for the resin mold sides as well.\nBuild Perimeter of Resin Mold\nFirst, I placed the cypress wood in the resin mold and grabbed a few scrap pieces of 3/4\u2033 plywood for the each side, front, and back. As I mentioned previously, I covered the sides, front, and back pieces with packing tape and furniture wax.\nKeep in mind, the perimeter pieces don\u2019t need to be cut to size in order to fit perfectly. Essentially, they will work as long as they form a square.\nNext, I used my brad nailer to hold down the sides, front, and back pieces. Then, I used my hot glue gun to seal the resin mold and prevent leaking. Silicone or hot glue seal and prevent resin from leaking.

You can use it to reorient a log by moving only one end etc.\n\nI made one using this design a few years ago and have corrected some problems before making this one for this instructable. This design has held up well.\nI got it into my head to make one back in the day when these cost over $100. They can be had for less now but with scavenged parts this came in at around $4. For me the original delay in making one was finding a substitute for one critical piece. A cant hook typically has a curved part with a hook on the end. I wasn't going to heat and bend a piece of metal, and a cold piece of metal bent would just unbend when used. One day I recognized a piece of a garage door opener that could serve the purpose, and it has.\nThis cant hook design has served me well on logs over 30\" in diameter. I try to avoid larger logs because of the size of my chainsaw.\nSince starting this instructable I came up with an attachment to add to this project to allow the cant hook to be used as a log lifter/log jack.

If you are not so lucky then drill a 1/4\" or larger hole centered in one leg of each angle iron such that they match and align with each other. The size of the angle iron can diverge from what I have used but if you do choose other specifications understand that that these \"feet\" are subjected to a lot of lateral and vertical forces when lifting big logs. You will also be likely lifting logs on soft soil. Do not use lighter thickness metal, and retain or exceed the area contacting the ground to prevent it from sinking in too far.\nThe first illustration shows the parts loosely assembled for clarity.

The bolted leg of the lift assembly faces away from the cant arm.\nThis can be secured with a few taps of a hammer. It can be removed the same way. The bonus of the taper of the lift assembly legs and the roundness of the pipe is that with a few taps the assemble is very secure. This provides easy and quick conversion from cant to lifter and vice versa.\nIf you have trouble inserting the lift assembly legs in the cant pipe it is probably because the point's bolt was not exactly centered.

Throughout this Instructable I will attempt to inform you what I would have done had I owned the correct tool.\nINTRODUCTION:\nI have a very small shop in my two car garage. Unfortunately I have to share that space with two cars. When I am sanding, routing or drilling, dust seems to coat every surface in my garage, including my wife car. I was tired of washing my wife\u2019s car so I needed to find a solution to all the dust I was creating. I did some research and found some sanding downdraft tables, but I couldn\u2019t imagine those working without an incredibly powerful vacuum (which I do not have), plus they do not contain the dust jettisoned out. I then started looking at bead blasting cabinets and found that I liked the containment aspect of the cabinet but I needed the downdraft capabilities of the sanding tables, so I decided to create a hybrid.\nMATERIALS:\nWith the exception of the the adhesive backed rubber stripping and the thumbscrews, all materials were purchased at Homedepot.\n1/2 MDF - Paneling\n1/4 MDF - Funnel, Door\n1/4 MDF White Peg Board\n3/4\" x 3/4\" sq Dowel - Framing\n1x3 Hardwood (Poplar) - Back Panel\n1x2 Hardwood (Poplar) - Framing\nHandle - Custom or OTS\nHinges (The link is for zinc plated, but i found black) - https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-1-1-2-in-Zin...\nABS Toilet Flange - https://www.homedepot.com/p/Oatey-Oatey-ABS-Open-...\n#10 Threaded insert (If you go this route, buy the installation tool) - https://www.mcmaster.com/90016a021\n#10 Thumb Screw - https://www.mcmaster.com/2776k14\n3/4\"W adhesive backed rubber strip - https://www.mcmaster.com/8694k16\nLED Strip - There are a bunch of options.\nLexan Polycarbonate Sheet - https://www.homedepot.com/p/LEXAN-24-in-x-18-in-x...\nConstruction Adhesive - https://www.homedepot.com/p/Loctite-PL-Premium-10...\nSilicone Sealant - https://www.homedepot.com/p/DAP-Silicone-Max-2-8-...\nWood Glue\nWood Filler Natural Colored\nAssortment of wood screws", "title": "Garage Dust/Sanding Enclosure", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Garage-DustSanding-Enclosure/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The first step is deciding what size box you want to make.

I wanted something very sturdy my boy could actually play with, jump on, etc, but didn't want to pay a lot. of this train bed for my boy and I'm really happy with it. I've also included some pictures of the actual train I used for my design.\nI was very inspired by another instructables article: \"Dump Truck Bed with Front Loader Book Shelf\" by djmccray (https://m.instructables.com/id/Building-a-dump-truck-bed-with-front-loader-book-s/).

I searched for \"toddler beds\" and \"train beds\", etc, but most of them are of Thomas the Train or something similar. Many appear to be made by attaching flat panels and shapes to an existing bed frame. While this could have been a much cheaper and timely solution, I wanted something more durable and closer to a model train.\nI reviewed many pictures of actual train body styles before deciding on the Western Maryland Fast Freight Line at B&O Railroad Museum. I almost settled on the BNSF style (which is fairly boxy and seemed easier to make) thinking I could turn the very front into a toy box, but decided that my boy could use a bookshelf instead. Also, the extra cab space gives him a place to curl up and read.\nMy Guiding Design Principles:\n1) Strong enough for my boy to play on it and for me to curl up in it with him (i.e. it has to support my body weight).\n2) Must disassemble easily for transport between rooms or in case we move.\n3) And of course, it has to look awesome!!\nConceptual Drawings:\nOnce I had a good idea of what I wanted I sketched 2 or 3 ideas on paper before getting wrapped around my 3D CAD program as I knew would happen.\nDesigning Using Google Sketch-up:\nSketch-up is a great free drawing tool. It's fairly simple in 2D space like any paint program, but takes a little getting used to in 3D. However, it is far simpler to use than any other CAD program I've tried.\nMost of my time on this project was spent on the design. I did have some difficulty figuring out how to intersect curves and shapes at first. After drawing out a paper thin model in sketch-up using plane geometry it was fairly easy to \"grow\" those planes into side walls and support frames of the right thickness. Besides being able to easily measure any aspect of a drawing and scale the model to your needs, Sketch-up has a feature whereby you can highlight all the planes and edges of a shape and create \"components.\" Those components can then be duplicated anywhere in the model. If you modify that component directly it will change all of them at the same time. This was a real time saver.\nParts Layout:\nThe beauty of designing the whole bed in sketch-up at the right scale was that I could then load those components into another sketch-up document and move the pieces around on virtual lumber that I drew (much in the same way you could cut out paper scale drawings and move them around to minimize lumber waste). I measured and labeled all aspects of each component and printed those drawings as a complete set of plans for use in my garage.\nPlease see my Google Sketch-up files for detailed plans. One is the full 3D model. The other is a component layout on virtual lumber. Both have overall dimensions for the major parts and detailed dimensions for every component which can be switched on or off.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FO5/J8KG/I8BGHBDQ/FO5J8KGI8BGHBDQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Design / Google Sketch-up"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I mostly have just hand power tools, but a table saw and band saw would certainly have made the project much easier and faster.

That's just not going to happen. I created a simple circular saw jig using the first 12\" of a sheet of 1/4\" plywood. First, determine which side of the plywood sheet is the most true, then rip a strip about 2\" wide (which I'll call the \"fence\") using a circular saw on a drawn line. Then cut another strip about 10\" wide (which I'll call the \"base\") from the same edge and glue the fence onto the base about 5\" from the edge (a little more than the width of your circular saw's shoe edge to the blade). Once the glue is cured set the shoe of your circular saw on the base and against the fence so it cuts just a little off the edge of the base. Voila, straight cuts from now on and all you have to do is put the edge of my jig on your pencil marks and clamp it down. I purposely left excess material on the other side of mine so I could do the same thing with my 3/4\" straight cut router bit. Two jigs in one!\nStrong Curved Panels Require Curved Supports:\nTo get that curved look, I decided to build a simple curved frame using the 2x4\" studs and bend 1/4\" plywood over the top. Having a band saw would have been amazing, but all I have is an orbital jig saw. Despite my best efforts, I couldn't keep the blade from bowing into the work. Trust me, I had quality blades, I made many relief cuts, and I steered the jigsaw rather than pushed it through the work. The pocket plane was very handy to smooth out and square up my shoddy cutting.\nTo get the final 1/4\" plywood panels to be flush on the edge of MDF, I clamped a couple scrap pieces to overhang on each side of the curved supports and lowered them until flush. This is where I glued and screwed them in to place (see pictures 3-5 above). I did the same thing for the front compartment (see picture 8).\nA Curved Template:\nThe 1/4\" template I mention below allowed me to draw and rough-cut each panel: the top, front window, and two front compartment pieces. I wanted my curves to be smooth all the way across and for the plywood to tightly fit against the sides of the train cab. You'll notice in the 3rd picture above that there is a small triangular gap on the right side where the curved support piece is raised above the side rail. To make this easier, I cut a 3\" wide strip of 1/4\" plywood so it was about an inch longer on both sides when wrapped over the curve. I screwed this down to the curved frame and flush trimmed it to become the perfect template for each curved panel (see pictures 4 & 5 above).\nFlush Trimmed Edges:\nThe first panel I installed was the one containing the front windows. Even though I rough-cut the curve using a template, the edge was much cleaner after a flush trim. The top piece fit very snugly and that too was rough cut and trimmed flush with the face. Since the top curved down toward the sides, a flush trim bit wouldn't do the trick. I had to finish those edges with a flush cut saw.\nFront Compartment:\nThe front compartment was built in pretty much the same way (see picture 8), starting with the front-most panel and laying the top on after. The top required a concave curve to align with the face under the windows first. For that, I used a previously cut curve and trimmed it to fit tightly. This too was flush-trimmed once secure. I cut the book case panels to size and used them to set the height of the front compartment (see picture 9). I wanted the book case portion to fit snugly under the curve in front.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0C/R9MW/I88LQFYM/F0CR9MWI88LQFYM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5I/VWT8/I88LQFZY/F5IVWT8I88LQFZY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4I/KAZX/I88LQFYN/F4IKAZXI88LQFYN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNZ/YHRX/I88LQFZZ/FNZYHRXI88LQFZZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHP/1A0F/I88LQFYO/FHP1A0FI88LQFYO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY9/XA26/I88LQG04/FY9XA26I88LQG04.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDL/X2ZM/I88LQG03/FDLX2ZMI88LQG03.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6U/LML6/I88LQG02/F6ULML6I88LQG02.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEF/ET0Y/I88LQG05/FEFET0YI88LQG05.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY7/ZSAU/I8BGI3T5/FY7ZSAUI8BGI3T5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR8/FL41/I8BGI3T4/FR8FL41I8BGI3T4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHE/DIR3/I8BGI3TB/FHEDIR3I8BGI3TB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Cut Out and Assemble"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Masking Tape as a Logo Mask:\nI have little in the way of free-hand talent.

There are several ways to go about building one, but after seeing a few example of vises using linear bearings and rods to act as a parallel guide, I thought I'd give it a shot.\nOne thing to consider before getting started is which side of the bench to mount the leg vise. Since I'm (mostly) right-handed, I'll be mounting the vise to the front-left leg to make edge planing easier, but if you're left-handed you may want to consider mounting it to the front-right leg.", "title": "Workbench Leg Vise", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Workbench-Leg-Vise/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I got a bit of a head-start on the vise installation while I was still working on the bench by drilling a few holes for the vise screw and linear bearing that I will be using in the leg.

(Although I definitely recommend the wedge if you really like cranking down!)\nTo recess the linear bearing, I started by drilling a larger, shallow hole in the leg a few inches up from the bottom on the front face of the leg. At the center of that hole, I drilled another one that was just slightly larger than the bearing's cylinder so that there would be a small amount of wiggle room to make mounting it perpendicular to the leg face a bit easier.\nI then drilled another hole about 9\" down from the top of the leg's tenon (the bench top) for the vise screw.

For real impact, use clear or colored, transparent plastics. My favorites are the blues and greens, but, and as can be seen by the photos, the neon colors (e.g., orange, red, green and yellow), seem to capture and work with light to accent the ornament for a very unique effect.\nThough not mandatory you incorporated it into your project, the addition of copper plated turnings goes almost indescribably far in complementing the wood-plastic laminated portion of the turnings.\nThis instructable does not got into the process of creating such turnings, since the process is a significant instructable in itself. Until I get around to writing and posting how I do that, you can find information on the electroforming process on line.\nON A SAFETY NOTE:\n1.0 Taking this project on WILL generate a lot of nasty chips and dust from the shaping, sanding and polishing steps. Some of this will come off blades at hundreds of miles and hour and some is light enough it will float in the air.\n1.1 To avoid breathing the wood dust, an N-95 or better (e.g. N-99) rated mask should do. A handkerchief will not.\n1.2 For eye protection, you would have a good pair of polycarbonate safety glasses or at least a full face mask. I have several pairs of safety glasses and use them, religiously, weed eating and so on, so they are just a good, all around investment for people who tackle projects.\n1.3 No less important than your lungs and eyes are your fingers and hands. As such, learn and use proper and relative safety measures when operating tools and equipment mentioned here. For example:\n(a) NEVER let your fingers get anywhere near a moving saw blade. Instead, use push shoes on table saws, which are just \u201chigh end\u201d push sticks that have been extended, so they are ten or so inches long, to hold more of the wood down, especially at the back of the blade, where it comes up out of the table and where dangerous kickbacks start. Push sticks are perfect for bandsaw cuts. Ones I made for cutting on my bandsaws can be seen at the LumberJocks site:\nhttp://lumberjocks.com/projects/105726 ).\n\n(b) The long push shoe holds the material down several inches beyond what common push sticks do, and the heel allows you to push the material past the blade.\nNOTE: The heel should come down just enough to allow you to push the material, but should not touch the table [or it cannot hold the material flat against the table].\n(c) NEVER freehand cut on a table saw.\nOf course, there are many other important safety tips and it\u2019s good advice to look into them and to use them.", "title": "Light Catching Ornaments Made by Combining Wood, Acrylic & Copper", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Making-Light-Catching-Laminated-Wood-Plastic-and-C/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "To complete this project, you'll need some or all of the following materials:\n\n(1) WOOD\nObviously, you can use any wood you desire. You can even use 2 x 4's and such. It, simply, boils down to your choice of wood.\nI was fortunate and acquired a literal truck load of fine hardwood pieces for the price of my labor loading it. The pieces were too small for the door company that tossed them to use, but are perfect for small woodwork projects. So far, I have been able to use oak, walnut, koa, teak, maple, poplar, mahogany, hickory and other woods.\nIn short, you don\u2019t need a lot of expensive, by the board foot wood to do this process. But the wood should be well dried and should have a low moisture content.\n(2) PLASTIC (e.g. acrylic, Plexiglass (trade name), etc.).\nAs noted in the introduction, clear and colored transparent plastics produce the most desirable effects and the fluorescent colors seem to have light gathering characteristics and the most impact.\nToo, using thicker pieces (e.g., 1/4\" thick) also add greatly to the visual impact of the completed ornament.\nThough the fluorescent and thicker pieces have greater impact and produce very satisfying results, some of my favorite turnings were with the thinner green and blue pieces of plastic.\nThere are numerous sources for plastics on line. If you live in a large city, you may have suppliers from which you can purchase scraps and other pieces.\n(3) COPPER PLATED TURNINGS\nAs noted, this is just an option and requires either making your own or finding a source from which you can buy them. To date, I\u2019ve never found any on line, so learned how to do simple copper plating and made my own (again, another and complex instructable for another day).\n(4) GLUE\nAs of this writing, I have only used two to one (2:1), two part epoxy glue and cyanoacrylate [CA] glue.\nWhile Super Glue is CA, I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s a more tame version. For this and other wood working projects, I\u2019d buy CA indicated to be used in woodwork, pen making or similar projects, rather than trying the stuff you\u2019d find in the local grocery and drug store.\nI should note, I did have a couple of the epoxied projects come apart. I was starting out and did not rough up the plastic. As well, the wood was had small pores and may have had natural oils. All those things could affect the bond.\nTo solve the random , 1000 RPM disassembly problem (yet another good reason for having a good face shield) I rough sanded (80 grit) the plastic and the wood and glued them together again for a second run. The glue up held.\nAnother automatic disassembling blank that blew apart held good when I used the CA.\nIt may be I should consider also wiping the wood down with lacquer thinner or acetone to remove any surface oils that might be present on woods that may be prone to it.\nNOTES: For ease of use and to avoid slowing cure times, warm your epoxy to at least a comfortable room temperature before use. The ideal temperature of the glue is somewhere around You can do this by just letting it set in a warm pan of water, until you can see it flow well when you tip the bottle.\n(5) SANDPAPER\nMany sand down to 1,500 grit, which, though far from the finest, is pretty fine. I only go down to 320 grit, then finish up with buff compounds. The polish process goes very fast on the lathe, or with a buffer.\n(6) POLISH\nI have been using swirl mark remover I purchased from an auto parts store to bring a great finish to the plastic. It does a wonderful job.\nOn a whim, I decided to make my own buff compounds. I used bees wax from toilet rings I bought at a hardware store, then mixed it with pumice, rotten stone and diatomaceous earth. A bit of turpentine worked to dissolve the bees wax to allow the buff powders to mix with it.\nThese home made buff compounds do a great job for a small price, but require slightly different handling for a final finish (yet another, future instructable).\n7) WAX PAPER, MIX CUPS AND STIR STICKS\nThese are the toss away items for mixing and applying the glue, and for protecting your work area.\nYou can use most any expendable container to mix the glue, but sizing the container to the task makes it easier to complete. Since these kinds of projects don\u2019t require huge amounts of epoxy, I use the condiment cups sold at restaurant supply stores (e.g., Cash and Carry here in the Northwest). The wood coffee stir sticks they sell can be very handy for things like mixing and applying the glue too.\n8) If adding a plated or other turning to the top or bottom, you'll may want to use a dowel to hold the pieces together. I use baling wire, like that pictured above.\n8) FINISH.\nThis can be shellac, lacquer, oil based or waterborne polyurethane, CA glue, the wax left behind from the polishing process, or you can use any of the many homemade or other friction finishes used in the turning processes.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FN0/KE9Q/JOEW7N3W/FN0KE9QJOEW7N3W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F41/XHLL/JOEW7N40/F41XHLLJOEW7N40.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1H/GUKJ/JOEW7N41/F1HGUKJJOEW7N41.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F79/6YF0/JOEW7N3V/F796YF0JOEW7N3V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEO/XTQ6/JOSY0Y0A/FEOXTQ6JOSY0Y0A.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Project Materials List"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "As with any project, you\u2019ll need tools and /or equipment to complete it. This project can be completed using simple hand tools, power hand tools, stationary equipment or a combination of the foregoing.\nOf course, hand tools will be more labor intensive, while power tools will make the job much easier. Especially if you want to make more than one item. Then there is the fact the tools listed and talked about here can be used on many future projects.\nThe following are tools and equipment that can be used to complete this project:\n[PROJECT DIMENSIONING]\nTABLESAW -\nA tablesaw will handle cutting wood, plastic and even non-ferrous metals, like aluminum.\nAs noted in the safety section, above, do not cut material free hand on a table saw. Use a fence, a miter slot push tool or a sled to guide the wood and plastic through the blade.\nWhen cutting thin plastics and wood, the material needs to be held tight against the table at the area of the blade to avoid vibration or chatter. Chatter can produce bad cuts (e.g., lots of chipping) AND can cause the plastic to shatter or kick back. As such, you should have some kind of feather board to hold the material down.\nIf you prefer, you could do as some do and use a sacrificial piece of wood over the laminate, to add thickness during cutting.\nYou can use a tablesaw sled, just as you would with wood, to size your pieces to the desired width and length.\nMITER BOX -\nAs with a tablesaw, you can use a motorized miter box to shorten your pieces of wood and plastic to the lengths you choose for your project.\nWhile you can use a manual miter to cut pieces, I suspect the plastics would play havoc on the blade sharpness in a short period of time.\nBANDSAW -\nA bandsaw can do most of what the table saw does and may even feel more comfortable in use.\nHAND SCROLLSAW -\nA scrollsaw will serve just fine for all your cuts for this project.\nIf yours is a variable speed scrollsaw, you may want to slow the blade to minimize melting the plastic.\nBLADES [for table, miter, band and scroll saws]\nYou can buy specialty table and miter saw blades for cutting plastics. Generally, the more teeth, the smoother the end cut. HOWEVER, as you increase the thickness of the material, you want fewer teeth, to allow chips to clear and to avoid melting the plastic back together (e.g., welding).\nKeep in mind, stacking plastic for cuts is the same thing as cutting a piece the same thickness of the stack.\nMany hardware stores sell scrollsaw blades specifically designed for cutting plastics. Again, this may be a good investment, if you are going the scrollsaw route, but you can make do with a wood cutting blade.\nI have used my fine tooth (60 and 80 tooth), ten inch blades for this with very good results. However, there are blades available just for cutting plastics and if you are going to cut much of it, I believe it worthwhile to invest in a good one.\nNOTE: For this project, the rough edges left by saw cuts will be sanded away or removed in the process of turning or otherwise shaping the ornament, so getting a perfect cut is not critical. Of course, the less chipping, the less material you will have to remove to get a finished surface on the end product.\nSCRIBE - You can buy inexpensive non-powered tools to cut plastic in a fashion similar to how you cut glass using a glass cutter. These are carbide tipped tools that scribe a line into the plastic, where you want it broken.\nAfter several passes (unlike with a glass cutter, which should only make one pass), you set the plastic on a table edge or something similar to support it, with the piece to be broken off unsupported, then you snap the unsupported piece off.\n[PROJECT SHAPING]\nAs with dimensioning the materials, there are various ways of shaping the wood and plastic lamination. For example:\n(1) WOOD LATHE - In my opinion and regarding shaping, sanding and polishing the ornament, the lathe is king.\nThough this was my go to tool for shaping and finishing the laminated wood-plastic blanks, this could be said to be an optional tool, since you could still make decorative wood-plastic items by cutting, sanding and polishing them using the other hand and power tools mentioned here.\n(2) ROUTER - Absent jigs and such, a router is limited in the shapes it will produce, but it can give nice results with minimal effort. For example, you can use the router to make slight round-overs on the edges of square or rectangular pieces.\nKey to using a router is, make small cuts and use a good, sharp, carbide bit.\n(3) DRILLS (Drill press and powered hand drill) - A means of drilling is necessary for establishing centers for mounting on the lathe and drilling eye hook mounting holes.\nThe drill press can be used as a shaping device, but does require some ingenuity. For example, you require a live center that can be mounted to the drill press table and a drive center for the chuck.\nThe bearing of the live center allows the piece to turn without creating heat, which would melt the plastic and create undesirable results. You need one which would take a bolt and allow you to bolt it to the table, or you could drill a hole in a block of wood and into which the center would mount. The block would need to be clamped to the drill press table.\nThe drive center would be anything that would fit in the chuck and lock there to force the piece to spin on the live center, when the drill was running.\n(3) RASPS, FILES AND SANDPAPER - You can use rasps, files and sandpaper to shape your laminated piece before moving on to the final finish and polish.\nRasps and files can be either handheld or motor driven, such as those used in a hand drill or drill press. Regardless which version you use, they are good for removing stock fast, to rough a shape in.\nA hand held rasp, file or even a dowel with sandpaper mounted to it can be used with the drill press to shape and smooth.\nFor those who do not own handheld or stationary sanders, just a piece of sandpaper wrapped about a block of wood or a dowel will work reasonably fast for shaping and sanding work.\nNOTE: You can cut a slot in the end of the dowel as deep as the sandpaper you will be wrapping around it is wide to hold the paper, as you wrap it around the dowel.\n(4) SANDING EQUIPMENT -\nThis covers a wide array of hand and power equipment. For example:\n- A drum-disk sander can be used to bring all the sides of a piece flush with each other prior to final sanding. It may even be flat enough to prep short pieces for gluing.\n- A belt sander clamped to a bench and on end or upside down can be used like a drum-disc sander, sans the disk, of course.\n- A spindle sander can be used in the shaping process and even for nearing the project to final sanding.\n- A thickness sander or something like the FlatMaster sander can be used to create the flat edges for joining and, again, for bringing all the surfaces flush to each other.\n- Quarter sheet and detail pad sanders can be used in all stages of shaping and sanding a piece.\n- Even a lathe can be considered a type of sander, since it makes the shortest work of sanding a turned piece.\n- A drill press, mentioned below, can be used for sanding and shaping. However, it should be remembered the bearings were designed for downward, rather than side pressure.\n(5) BUFFING EQUIPMENT - Again, the lathe can handle this operation. If you don\u2019t have one, a buffer dedicated to that task would be ideal. If you don\u2019t have that, you can buy hook-and-loop pads that will mount in a drill or VARIABLE SPEED grinder (you\u2019d need to slow an angle grinder down to, safely, use it for buffing, and to avoid melting the plastic).\nYou can also use some sanders as polishers. Again, the hook and loop is a must.\nIn a pinch, microfiber cloths think they are hook-and-loop pads, if pressed against the pad. The polish compounds mentioned in the material section will work fine on this and other mentioned buffers.\n(6) CLAMPS - Clamps may be helpful for some operations. For example, I use clamps I made from plywood ( https://www.instructables.com/id/SMALL-PARTS-HOLD... ) to hold small parts when cutting them on the bandsaw, for sanding some items and even for certain shaping operations.\nI, certainly, would use a clamp to hold pieces I was routering, to keep them from being flung across the room AND to keep my fingers far from the bit.\n(7) CENTER FINDING GAUGES - This can be an actual center finder (the V shaped tool with one edge of a ruler running through it) or a marking gauge, like the one I made and shown in the photos, above.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FEB/REY1/JOEW7N56/FEBREY1JOEW7N56.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZP/12O7/JOEW7N57/FZP12O7JOEW7N57.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWM/LJLT/JOSY0YNQ/FWMLJLTJOSY0YNQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZJ/09Q1/JOSY0YON/FZJ09Q1JOSY0YON.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Project Tool List"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "1.1 To get started, you need to make a blank to shape, sand and polish. This is done by cutting pieces of wood and plastic, then gluing them together.\n\nNOTE: This instructable focuses on a simple blank made up of two pieces of wood and one piece of plastic, but the final step includes notes about other design ideas.\n1.2 Regarding cutting the plastic and wood to length, for safety purposes and if using a tablesaw, it\u2019s safer to run longer pieces through a table saw. Shorter ones (e.g., 5\") are more likely to catch and result in dangerous kickbacks.\n1.2.1 If you do find it necessary to cut shorter pieces on a tablesaw, remember to stand to the side of and not behind the blade, AND use a push shoe, rather than a common push stick, to hold the entire piece down.\n1.3.1 Cut a piece of plastic to the width you need to make your ornament. For example, if you intend it to be 3/4\" in diameter, cut the plastic to 3/4\" wide.\n1.3.2 When sizing pieces, over sizing them will not, generally, cause problems. Of course, it will result in more waste, and could require more care and effort during shaping, depending on the equipment used.\nNOTE: If using a fine tooth wood cutting blade (e.g., a sixty to eighty tooth ten inch blade), you can use the same blade to cut both the plastic and the wood in the next steps. If you do, you can, also, use the same set up for cutting the plastic to make the first cuts in the wood.\n1.4.1 Cut the two pieces of wood that will sandwich the plastic to the same width you cut the plastic. For the example mentioned in \u201c1.3.1,\u201d above, that would be 3/4\" wide.\n1.5.2 Cut the wood for the two sides to thickness. The two pieces of wood and the plastic should all have equal thicknesses. Their thicknesses added up should equal the width of the plastic and the wood. Again, for the example in \u201c1.3.1,\u201d above, that would be 3/4\", or 1/4\" each.\nNOTE: If you will have to dress the wood to get rid of saw marks, for a flat surface, allow just a little more thickness to account for stock removal in that process.\n1.5.3 If it helps, the thickness is half of the 3/4\" (6/8\") width of the plastic, which is 3/8\", minus half the thickness of the 1/4\" (2/8\") plastic, which is 1/8\", or 1/2\".\nNOTE: Again, cutting oversized would not pose a significant problem. As such and to simplify things and if stock removal will not be a problem (e.g., you will be using a wood lathe to shape the blank), you can just cut the wood to a thickness that is half the width of the plastic and expect to remove a bit more wood.\n1.6.1 When done cutting the wood, the sides you will glue to the plastic must be flat, to insure a good glue joint. Of course, pieces this size SHOULD NOT be ran on a jointer, so I resort to one of my sanders. I find my drum or belt sander do an adequate job.\n1.6.2 To avoid having to hold, for example, a 1/4\" thick piece of wood on drum sander, you can just finish the two outside faces of a piece of wood sized to the plastic, then cut it down the middle, leaving the two smooth outsides for a glue joint.\n1.7 While you want flat surfaces for the glue joints, you do not want them too smooth, so sand both sides of the plastic and, if necessary, the glue joint sides of the wood using eighty or one hundred grit sandpaper.\n1.8 Protect the work area. Remember than the glues you will be using WILL soak through paper. Use painters plastic, visquine, wax paper or other suitable material on your work surface.\n1.9.1 You can use either a two part epoxy or cyanoacrylate glue, also known as CA glue. SuperGlue is an example of CA glue, but is not as strong as the commercial versions. When buying CA for this project, I recommend the medium thickness.\n1.9.2 If using epoxy, mix enough to cover both sides of the plastic. Follow directions carefully for amounts and be sure to scrape the sides and bottom of the mix container well so you do not get any soft spots in the glued surfaces.\nNOTE: You may want to warm your epoxy, if it\u2019s been in a cold shop or garage. To do this, you can warm water on a stove, THEN remove the water from the stove and set the containers (don\u2019t use a pan or pot you\u2019ll use for cooking) in the heated water to warm. Alternately, keep it in a warm part of the house or shop until ready to use. Something in the area of seventy-five degrees will help it flow.\n1.9.3 Spread the glue on one of the flattened sides of one piece of wood, then lay the plastic on that and press it down to remove air (you\u2019ll be able to see it).\n1.9.4 Add another layer of glue to the side of the plastic facing you, then press the flattened side of the second piece of wood on.\n1.9.5 Set the three pieces on their sides and clamp using moderate pressure. For a five inch long piece, I use two clamps. Use your good judgement.\nNOTE: If your wood pieces are thin, it might be a good idea to have a couple pieces of wood that will go between the two sides of the clamp and the project so pressure will be even across the piece.\nNOTE: The epoxy acts as a slippery lube and your wood and plastic may shift, so adjust accordingly to keep everything in alignment, as you add pressure.\n1.9.6 Whether using CA or epoxy, give the project twenty-four hours, for the glue to fully cure, before beginning the shaping process.\n1.10.1 To make the blank easy to mount on a lath, or in a drill press, you need to find center on each end and drill shallow mounting holes.\n1.10.2 If not already square, square the ends. This can be done with a miter saw, by pressing them against a sander, cutting them on a band saw using a miter gauge, using a sled and your table saw, or even using a hand saw and a fine tooth blade.\n1.10.3 Measure half way across and as close to center as you can on the plastic and make a mark for center. I use a combo square or a marking gauge and check for center from both sides, then mark the center point, at the center of the plastic, using an awl (see the photos).\nNOTE: Normally, I find center by drawing an X by making lines from corner to corner, but this works only if the blank is square. Since seldom worry about subtracting half the thickness of the plastic from each wood side or even worry overly much about insuring both sides were of an equal thickness, this will give me a center that lands center of the plastic.\n1.10.4 Once you\u2019ve marked center, drill a small hole for the drive and live ends of the lathe or other item that will hold the piece for turning/shaping the blank. About a 1/16th inch (.0625\") bit, give or take a little, should be sufficient, and you need only drill about 1/8\" deep.\n1.11.1 Mount your blank on your lathe, on your drill press, or clamp it in a soft jaw vice (e.g., wrap it in cloth or foam) and begin shaping it.\n1.11.2 If using a lathe:\n(a) Keep your knives sharp and take light cuts.\n(b) Experiment with different knives to see which one(s) give you the smoothest cuts. For example, I find roughing gouges rough blanks to cylinders well, and detail gouges do great for intricate shaping. I limit my use of skews to detail lines, and scrapers seem to be better for rough shaping than finishing.\n(c) When near the final shape, take light cuts and keep your knives sharp to avoid chipping the plastic.\n1.11.3 If using a drill press:\n(a) Mount a drive center. If your drill press accepts Morris tapers, use one sold for uses on a lathe. If your Drill press uses a screw mounted chuck, a spur or Forstner bit may do the job of acting as a drive center.\n(b) For the table end, you need something that will allow the blank to turn, without generating heat. A common live center (the pointed head turns freely because it is mounted using a bearing), that will accept a bolt on the end would suffice, though you\u2019d have to mount it through 2x scraps to support it, before bolted to the table.\n(c) Since the drill press turns slow, compared to a lathe, you\u2019ll have to use files and rasps to shape your blank. I have used a Rotozip or a router and a LIGHT touch, but those will only be good for roughing in the shape.\n(d) Keep in mind, your drill press was engineered for downward and not side pressure, so, if using it for these processes, try to avoid putting anymore side pressure on the chuck/drive than required to get the job done. In other words, it\u2019s the usual advice \u201clet the tools (e.g., rasps, files, sandpaper) to the work and be patient.\n1.12.1 To finish your shaped blank, you\u2019ll have to sand and polish it. When you do:\n(a) Use a light touch with sand paper, meshes and so forth.\n(b) Keep moving around the piece AND around the sandpaper, to avoid building up heat either.\n(c) If you have trouble getting rid of lines, consider slowing the lathe or drill press down.\n(d) While the piece is mounted on a lathe or drill press, you can stop the machine and sand in the opposite direction (i.e., end to end). Often, this will remove even significant scratches quickly.\n1.12.2 Usually, 150 grit sandpaper will get you very near where you need to end up. If it doesn\u2019t and is taking too long, back up to 100 grit, then move to 150 grit again.\n1.12.3 Though other turners I know work through sandpaper grits, to around 1,500, I never bother going over 320 grit. Even then, I don\u2019t work my way to 320 by first using 180 and 220. I just go straight to it, then move to buffing. Of course, if you desire to work through the grits and up to the higher grits, nothing prohibits it, but I think you\u2019ll be surprised and happy with the results you get from my approach.\n1.13 Once sanding is complete, buff your piece using a buff compound of your choice on a soft, spiral sewn buff wheel to bring out the high optical impact of the plastic, and smooth up the wood:\n(a) At about 1,500 RPM [and even slower], you MUST keep moving, or you will melt the plastic. If you melt the plastic, it will still shine, but the melted areas will be conspicuous and will detract from the end product.\n(b) You can use swirl mark remover for automotive paint jobs, which is sold at auto parts stores, to bring the plastic [and resin] back to crystal clear from a 320 grit and better sanded surface.\n(c) The ornaments in the photos were buffed, while still on my lathe, using buff compounds I made using wax from toilet rings sold in hardware stores mixed with diatomaceous earth (my favorite), pumice and rottenstone thinned with just enough turpentine (paint thinner might work too, I haven\u2019t test driven it yet) to allow me to mix the ingredients.\nNOTE: Home made buff compounds using beeswax and diatomaceous earth, pumice, cerium oxide, baking soda and so on are cheap, easy to make, and can speed your project to a final, high shine. However, be aware rotten stone makes the mix dark, so can pose a problem when buffing light, porous wood.\n1.14 Apply the final finish of your choice:\n(a) While the beeswax left by the buffing processes, initially, looks nice, it fades VERY QUICKLY and has no durability. The sheen from beeswax can fade in hours. As such, you need a more durable finish, like lacquer, shellac and so on.\n(b) Since the beeswax based homemade buff compounds leave a film, and do not provide an ideal end finish, clean the turning with a rag dampened with turpentine or paint thinner, then applying a final finish.

Usually, this applies to the plated turnings too, but it frequently happens that I remove the portion that had the mounting hole for aesthetic reasons. As such I have to mark center again.\n2.2 To find center, I use a center finding gauge like those found in try-square kits, or I use one of the marking gauges I made. Regardless which one I use, I make several FINE pencil marks to get as close to dead center as I can. If I have to, I erase lines and start over using the last setting I had on the marking gauge. (See the photos in the previous step).\n2.3 Once I\u2019ve found center and marked it, I use an awl to mark center. This insures my drill bit will not wander when I drill the end.\n2.4 Among the various rolls of solid wire I keep around for projects is a role of baling wire. I\u2019ve found pieces of the wire makes great dowels for mounting the copper plated turnings to the ornament.\n2.5 I use a bit that gives a snug fit between the wire and wood and drill the end of the ornament and the plated turning, where both will mount together. I allow about 1/4\" in the wood and about 1/8\" in the plastic of the ornament (the deeper the hole, the more it can be seen when the wire dowel is inserted).\n2.6 Once the holes are drilled, I press the wire into either the ornament or the copper plated turning. In the photo, above, you can see the wire inserted in the plastic-wood turning before being cut to length.\n2.7 I dry fit the two pieces by pressing the other piece onto the wire dowel. Often I find I am just a smidgen off, but by turning either the ornament or the plated turning, the two will line up. If the two were too far off of center, I would fill the hole on the plated turning with epoxy and try a better aligned hole.\n2.8 When I am happy with the fit, I add a dab of glue to hold the two together and in the position that best aligns the two pieces, then let it set overnight. I had been using epoxy, but find the E6000 glue sold in hobby stores and on line more convenient.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F4V/7XUK/JOSY0B7A/F4V7XUKJOSY0B7A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWR/CO3O/JOSY0B7B/FWRCO3OJOSY0B7B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBL/EE9T/JOSY0B85/FBLEE9TJOSY0B85.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP8/EVZG/JOSY0BW1/FP8EVZGJOSY0BW1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQO/ODZG/JOSY0ZDW/FQOODZGJOSY0ZDW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: ADDING COPPER PLATED TURNINGS"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "REGARDING WAX [including the wax left behind from polishing]:\n\nIt's not very durable, and seems to fade to a dull finish in as little as an hour.\nThough these may not see a lot of handling and may not suffer abuse, you may want a tougher finish, or may want to get beyond the dull finish.\nIf using other than the wax finish, it would be a good idea to use thinner or turpentine to wipe off all you can, before applying the final finish. That said, lacquer seems to be content with a quick wipe down. Poly may too.\nTo give an idea of the clarity of wax finishes for this type of project, note what happens if you use a clean rag to finalize the polishing - the ornament starts taking on an immediate shine, as the wax is removed. The clarity of the plastic increases remarkably.\nIf you like wax and want to experiment, consider adding some Carnuba wax to some beeswax to increase the durability of the wax finish, and to get to more of a satin finish.\nREGARDING POLYURETHANES:\nOil based polyurethane will give your project the usual amber tint and will detract from the clarity you'd get with another choice for a finish. Waterborne polyurethane will give a more clear finish, but I haven't test driven it with the clear plastics yet.\nREGARDING SHELLACS:\nShellac can be amber or clear and could be compared to the poly color equivalents.\nREGARDING LACQUER:\nThis is my go to finish for these projects. It goes on easy. Does not require sanding between coats, is clear, and is durable.\nREGARDING CA GLUE:\nI haven't tried CA as a finish, but do know it, otherwise, plays well with the plastic and wood. Others swear by it and I am inclined to believe their choice is as sound as my choice.

For example, you could mount the plastic at an angle between the wood, as in the photos, or you could sandwich wood with plastic. The blank, above, was made by welding two pieces of plastic at ninety degrees to another piece (one piece on each side), then four pieces of wood were added.\n(g) You can stack plastic and weld it together using solvents or glue. I recommend the former, since, properly done, it will not leave a glue line.\n(h) When welding pieces of plastic together, you can stack different colors of plastics.\n(i) When shaping the blanks, you can simply sand and polish the laminated piece to produce squares and rectangles and use them as is, or for other projects.

Suffice to say the loading, unloading, loading again, and unloading again gets tiresome and also burns a lot of hours. We wanted something that could roll up to the market spot, open up and be ready in minutes. We kicked around numerous ideas of speeding up this process while creating a unique marketable image. We looked at trailers but were once again using our family vehicle to move it around. We tried looking at antique trucks but found that their size and overall reliability were going to be a hinderance. We needed something small, cost-efficient, unique, and attractive... cue the mini-truck. With this Instructable I am going to show you how to make a micro market truck that can be used for a myriad of purposes. We purchased a 1990 Subaru Sambar as the base of our micro market truck. These little trucks come right over from Japan, so they are right-hand drive. They are also classified as kei trucks in Japan, so they are small (ours is only about 10' long) and have equally small engines (660cc 4 cylinder). But, they are easy to work on, parts are accessible and affordable, and they are a blast to drive... did I mention they are four wheel drive? The bed of the truck is low to the ground (an important part to our display) and the sides and back of the bed fold down.\nOne of the biggest time gobblers during any unique process is finding inspiration from other folks. I can tell you that it took quite some time to narrow down our search to this unique machine and to design what the rear bed was ultimately to look like. I found a lot of inspiration and help from Daphne's Caravans, and after reaching out to Daphne for some advice I was well on my way to designing the truck. All told the entire thing cost about $6,500 (that includes the truck), but I am sure that you could design a similar structure for another similar flatbed truck.", "title": "Micro Market Truck", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Micro-Market-Truck/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Truck:\n1990 Subaru Sambar\nFrame:\n2x6 stock\n1-1/2\" outdoor screws\nwood glue\nPosts:\n2x4 stock\nSimpson Strong-Tie right angle connectors\n1-1/2\" washer head screws\n3\" outdoor screws\nBeams / Rafters:\n2x4 stock\n3\" outdoor screws\nSiding and Doors / Awnings:\n1x10 shiplap siding\n1-1/2\" outdoor screws\nRoof Sheathing, Waterproofing, and Covering:\n1/4\" flooring underlayment (easy to bend around curved roof)\nGrace Ice and Water Shield self-adhering membrane\nDuro-Last Painted Coil roofing and rubber washer screws (this was ordered from our local co-op in a 30' roll)\nHinges, Hardware, and Gas Struts:\nAcorn Iron-Forged strap hinges\n20# Gas Struts (These did not work, but they are still a good source)\n50# Gas Struts or from Grainger\nToggle clamps (to hold the side doors tight while driving)\nBarrel Bolt for back door and Fixed Bolt to hold one of the back doors in place", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: List of Materials"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "We found our mini-truck on good ole Craigslist from a guy who was working with a friend on importing them to the states.

Daphne's caravans have a reoccurring theme with the way she uses beams parallel to the length of the structure. She tapers the top edge of the rafter to meet the curve of the roof and all of her caravans look fantastic and hold up to the test of time... so that is the direction I decided to move towards. The most outside rafter was tapered at 20 degrees, the top most rafter had a taper of 0 degrees and the two on either side of the middle one had a taper of 15 degrees. I cut all of the tapers on a table saw. The back of the structure has an overhang of about 18\" and the front has a small overhang of 4\".

Before working with the other beams I sided the side closest to the cab of the truck and then marked off where the arch would be for the roof along with the three notches cut out of the siding for the beams to pass through (both on the front and back of the structure). The beams are supported by a notched piece of wood that is 4\" wide. The notch straddles the cross joists placed in the previous step and help support the roof. Note that this is a tiny roof overall, only 5' wide and 8' long. If you were planning on making this much larger I would suggest a more substantial framework to hold up the beams. Once again, the top beam was not tapered at all while the ones to the left and right are tapered 15 degrees to fit the curve of the roof.

After cutting the plywood with a circular saw to size I squared it up on the roof and simply screwed it down. To screw it down I started on one side and placed a screw at the center of the sheet of plywood on the very center of the outside beam. I then made sure it was all squared up and bent the other side over to the opposing beam and screwed that down. I used about five screws per beam evenly spread out (that is for a 4' wide section of roofing, I had to use two of those to span the entire length). After getting the plywood affixed I decided to put the corner braces in. Since this structure does not have walls along its length there is a substantial amount of torsional rigidity lost without the shiplap siding a gypsy caravan would have. This structure will have large doors on hinges, so I needed to bulk up the rigidity of the structure by using some simple braces.

I know you are supposed to put this stuff on when it is at least 40 degrees but the way this winter is looking that might be tough from this point onwards. I ended up cutting the ice and water shield to size (plus an inch or two over to overlap the side of the beam to make it very sealed... it will be covered by trim later on). Then I put it into place and stapled the very bottom edges to hold it in place for the next step. Using a heat gun I carefully heated up the membrane so that it would adhere to the wood. Once I get the metal roof on top of it and let the sun heat that up the whole thing will adhere quite well, this was just so that it was water tight for now while I work on the next steps. The nice part about working with Grace Ice and Water Shield during this time of the year is that it does not stick to itself which is a total pain and can ruin a nice long sheet of the stuff.

Of course there are a heap of other considerations to take into account including the door length and depth. This way you can determine the total amount of force necessary to both help lift and hold the door in place. Suffice to say that my initial purchase didn't fit the bill and the gas struts were grossly undersized even though the door weighed approximately 50 pounds. Also, the stroke was way too short and the initial 50 pound door had to be lifted for quite a ways until the gas springs started with the assist. I am 6'4\" so it is no problem at all, but my wife is a foot shorter. I found another company that supplies more substantial gas struts with a 16\" stroke and 34\" total length. I am in the process of contacting the company and seeing if they have any insight into the matter. It's a bit too cold to work on it anyhow (5 degrees this morning 11/23/18) so I am going to have to wait until it gets a bit warmer to put the metal roof on and put the gas struts in. It wont' be stained until spring of 2019 and once the stain is dried I will paint my wife's logo on both of the side doors and something on the front and back.

The roofing comes painted and in various widths (I ordered 42\") and I ordered the color matched rubber washer screws to affix it to the top. It cuts easily enough with a sharp set of tin shears since the roofing is only 29 gauge. When I ordered the roofing I had to choose between a 15' roll or a 30' roll. I needed only about 17' of the material so I had to commit to a 30' roll... not a big deal since I am sure I will put the other material to good use in the future. After cutting the sheets to size I cut the rounded corners on the two rear corners and two front corners. I also had to cut the front sheet's width down to 22\" so I wouldn't have a ridiculous overlap. Most important thing to remember is to always start by affixing the rear-most sheet first and then progressively overlap the sheets moving to the front. This will prevent driving rain from going into the joint and prevent the moving air from lifting up the roof. I used screws along the outside edges only spaced about every 6\" and then across the front edges of the beams.

In my case I had to attach the toggle closest to the cab to the actual structure and the hook to the door and for the back one I had to attach the toggle to the door and the hook to the structure (see the pics for more detail). Basically you need to tinker around to get these to work well for your application. I had to add small blocks of wood to the structure to bring everything along the same plane.\nAs for the back doors, I used a fixed bolt to hold one door in place. This allows you to use a barrel bolt across both doors to hold them tight. I ended up ordering a fixed bolt that you are supposed to mortise into a door by accident, but it still mounts nicely and looks good enough. You can also use what is called a chain bolt, which would work just as well.

December 21st is coming soon!\nThis was my third set of gas struts (also called gas springs) and they finally fit the bill. The first set were too short and did not have enough force to even assist in opening the doors. They were 20 pound struts and I decided to use two per door. The next set were 50 pound struts that were a total of 28\" long. These were the correct length and after a fair amount of trial and error I was able to get the doors to open to about 100 degrees and close flush with the bed of the truck. The only problem was that they only held the door up a bit and then the door slowly came down to about 70 degrees... not so safe for the patrons and kind of defeats the purpose of the display. Back into the box they went and I ordered four new 90 pound struts that were 28\" long. These did the trick and the door opens nicely from 0 degrees up to 100 degrees with no problem at all and then they hold right in place. My doors were six feet long and four feet deep and I placed the upper gas strut support 8\" away from the hinge joint on the door and 22\" down from the hinge on the frame of the structure. This allowed the door to close flush but open to 100 degrees easily. I will be honest and say that it took some trial and error but once it was done it was like a magic trick. I put the piston chamber at the top with the proper connector and the piston end facing down towards the structure itself. My door was about 50 pounds total in mass so the applied force of the two 90 pound struts exerted 8\" from the hinge joint is plenty to hold the door open and requires only a fair amount of energy to pull it back down to the closed position.

In lenses, we carefully control the angle at which light passes from one medium (air) into another medium (the glass or plastic material that makes up the lens) and back to focus or otherwise alter the light. Most camera lenses are composed of a number of individual lens elements which work together in groups to correct for various types of aberrations (optical errors) and produce a flat, focused image on the image plane (the camera's sensor). But if all of the lens elements are of a fixed size and shape, how do camera lenses focus or zoom the image? When a camera lens changes zoom or focus, it moves individual lens elements (or element groups) forwards and backwards with respect to each other inside of the lens.\nIn this instructable, we are going to produce only a single lens element, but unlike the lens elements in a typical camera lens, ours will be able to change shape (which will result in a change in its optical properties). This is because one side of our lens will have a transparent silicone membrane, which will change shape according to the amount of fluid inside of the lens.

Basically this project was a power downsizing of the slide projector.\nIn this new Instructable (November 2018) the original halogen projector bulb is replaced by an LED spotlight, which introduces more efficient technology. The LED spotlight has a power consumption of 5 W and a light yield of 350 lumen: power consumption is reduced by approximately 98% at a reduction in light yield of around 92%. With the LED light the projector is still sufficiently powerful to show a picture on a wall.\nThe main questions answered in this Instructable are:\nIs an LED spotlight pointed enough to act as a slide projector lamp? (Answer: yes)\nWhen opening an LED spotlight, will it still function? (Answer: yes)\nDoes an LED spotlight give a sharp projected picture? (Answer: yes)\nThe LED spotlight in question had one visible LED, but after opening it appeared that internally it consisted of four individual LEDs, with bridges between them. These bridges were optically cancelled out by the lenses in the slide projector. Also, it was found that opening the LED spotlight did not influence the functioning of the LED spotlight: there is no protective atmosphere in the LED (like there is in conventional light bulbs). And finally, it was found that the projected picture is pinpoint-sharp.\nThe next steps elaborate on the above findings in more detail.\nSafety notice: in the LED rebuild the lamp cooling fan is omitted, which cancels out the typical noise made by a slide projector. However, a powerful LED spotlight develops quite some thermal energy. Be sure to allow for enough convection around the LED spotlight in order to cool the lamp. It\u2019s a good idea to perform a long duration test to see whether temperatures remain acceptable.

Sometimes I clamped the wooden part and used it as a guide for the grinder (cf. picture).\nTo drill a hole precisely where you want, you need to scribe a cross (work on a flat surface), then punch the cross center, then use a center drill bit (I skipped this last step, the result is less precise). Also instead of drilling directly the diameter you want, it is better to start with smaller diameter. Finally drill your hole with a free moving vise if diameter is less than 6mm. If you want to continue with a larger diameter, secure the vise before removing the small drill bit, then change for a bigger bit. I found this article about the subject http://www.micro-machine-shop.com/hole_drilling.h... )\nTo drill the small hexagon, you need to drill with a 18 mm bit and then use a flat file to make the corners. This shape is only for centering the injector nozzle with the mold hole (cf. picture). If you want to go faster, simply drilling a 22 mm hole should works too.\nFor large holes (more than 20 mm diameter), I drilled with the max I had (20) and finished with the round file. Having previously scribed the shape you want to make helps a lot.\nTo ensure a perfectly perpendicular thread in the cylinder, you can secure the thread tap in the press drill chuck and manually rotate the chuck with one hand (do not switch the drill on!). While with the other hand you softly press down the crank.\nIn the first picture, the fourth hexagone has six threaded holes. Do not drill them.

The longboard is one of the world's simplest means of transportation. A \"deck,\" generally a flat piece of wood, attached to two hunks of metal, called \"trucks\" (why? The term actually relates back to British railroad cars which had an assembly of wheels, axles, bearings, and flexibility points that were termed \"trucks\"). Longboards are propelled by foot, like a scooter, and direction is changed by leaning to the left or right.\nWhy use a longboard?\nLongboards are simple, easy to use, and fun to ride. Perfect for college students, businessmen (@caseyneistat), and everyone in between, long-boarding provides a fun and efficient way to get from place to place. Trust me, when you're running late to class and have to choose between a longboard and walking, you'll choose the longboard every time.\nWhy make a longboard?\nWhile longboards are arguably the greatest creation since sliced bread, they can be very expensive. Often costing upwards of $250 for a 44\" board, the price is too high for a piece of laminated wood and some metal. Making a longboard is significantly cheaper than buying one and allows you to customize it any way you want. Another aspect that few think about is the feeling of making something that you can use everyday. The pride and joy you experience by simply looking at it is immeasurable.\nIn Summary:\n1. Longboards are easy to use and fun to ride\n2. Making a longboard is cheaper than buying one\n3. Longboards are fully customizable to meet your needs\n4. You'll feel awesome after you do it\nNow that you have a basic idea of what's going on, let's get going!", "title": "How to Make the Perfect Longboard Deck", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-the-Perfect-Longboard-Deck/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "This process doesn't have to be any more complicated than \"it's gotta be longer than it is wide\"; however, the more thought you put in here the better the final product will be. Depending on the purpose of your board, you will want different characteristics. I implore you to do some research and read \"The Longboard Glossary\" (https://www.thelongboardstore.com/the-longboard-glossary/) and get a good idea of what you want.\nYou should consider the following:\n- Purpose of the Board\n- Turn Radius\n- Length\n- Shape\n- Flex of the Board\nThere are dozens of styles of longboards, but three styles are the most popular among the culture. Cruising Boards, Freestyle, and Downhill.\nCruising Boards:\nOften referred to as \"cruisers\", these boards are by far the most common and are mainly used for transportation. The turns radius of the board should be dependent on the environment. Shorter boards will give you a smaller turn radius, which can be useful for cities, while longer boards will be better for moving in straight lines but have a larger turn radius. These boards are often shaped after surfboards for a \"pin-tail\" effect and have a slight flex in them for comfort.\nDownhill Boards:\nThese boards are meant for one thing, going downhill at incredibly high speeds. The world record for speed on these boards is 91.17 miles per hour, so the board must be incredibly stable. To achieve this riders use a longer board that which drops down in the middle, called a \"drop-down\" or \"drop-through\" deck for research, and is incredibly stiff to reduce wobbling at high speeds.\nFreestyle Boards:\nFreestyle boards combine downhill with sliding; that's right, people will purposely lean off of these boards and slide over the ground. (I highly recommend researching this just because its cool) This ability is made possible by a medium size board with a moderate turn radius. These boards are often drop-through or drop-down in style and have some flexibility to break away from the pavement.\nWhen researching keep in mind that the longboard will be supplemented by trucks and the wheels to create a one of a kind ride, and the quality of these components will matter just as much as the longboard's design.\nMy Choice:\nI want a good cruising board with a lot of flexibility, so I have chosen to modify a pin-tail design. My goal is to create a board long enough to be stable while all also incorporating a squared-off tail that ramps up at the end. I am basing my design off of a small surfboard native to Hawaii but will be adding my own flair for fun.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0U/1WT7/JOONKNE1/F0U1WT7JOONKNE1.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Design Your Longboard"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The required materials for this project are simple but will require a trip to Home Depot or a local hardware store.

I even needed to cut some wood down so that it would fit into an Uber and the employees were generous enough to do this for me in-store.\nMaterials List:\n- Wood for the Jig\n- Thin flexible veneers of wood which will eventually be a longboard\n- Screws\n- Wood Glue\n- Clamps, lots of clamps\nWe will be creating a Jig to form the longboard with, so we will need one piece of wood that is longer, thicker, wider, and significantly stronger than your intended board and some smaller strips of wood that are about one inch thick. This forming wood will depend on what you want your final result to be and will vary from project to project. Various screws are necessary to hold the pieces of forming wood together and wood glue will be used to laminate the board together. Any available weights or clamps will be used to hold the wood to the Jig, so acquire as many as possible from friends, family, or even strangers.\nAlong with these materials we will need wood for the longboard itself. This wood should be larger than you intend your final product to be, and very very thin. If possible, get several sheets of wood veneer which add up to your desired thickness. Wood veneers are very thin and flexible but when sheets are added together the board gets more and more stiff, so thickness will also relate to stiffness.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F96/G8MR/JOONKNSY/F96G8MRJOONKNSY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9H/G2P1/JOONKP96/F9HG2P1JOONKP96.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Acquire Materials"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "A longboard jig will be used to create the longboard; if used properly these jigs can be reshaped and reused in the future, so put some effort in here.

These features will be created by using high and low spots. A high spot, wherever you want the board to raise up, will have extra wood between it and the jig's base, while a low spot will have nothing between it and the Jig.\nI want my longboard to feature a large ramp at one end and concave along the entire board. In order to create the ramp I will add a large high spot to the end of the jig and concave will be acquired by adding high spots along the left and right edges of the board, and a low spot along the middle.\nHigh spots will be physically created by screwing pieces of forming wood to the Jig's base, which is best achieved by cutting the forming wood to height and length, clamping the wood together, drilling a pilot hole, and then screwing a screw in place.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOJ/3IO1/JOONKR9Y/FOJ3IO1JOONKR9Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3H/VPY4/JOONKQZW/F3HVPY4JOONKQZW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBK/JMWS/JOONKRU9/FBKJMWSJOONKRU9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIZ/4RQU/JOONKRU1/FIZ4RQUJOONKRU1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4B/JKIG/JOONKS1J/F4BJKIGJOONKS1J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNN/6O0M/JOONKRU5/FNN6O0MJOONKRU5.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Making the Jig"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The simplest way to describe this step is to glue the wood veneers together and clamp them in the Jig.

Then place two sheets of wood veneer next to each other and get ready to glue.\nExecution:\nOnce you have mentally prepared yourself, pour and spread an obscenely large amount of wood glue on both sheets and squish them together so that the sides with glue are touching. Make sure the glue is spread in an even layer across both pieces before pressing them together, otherwise there could be some air bubbles trapped in your board. Repeat this step until you have used all of your veneers and then place this bundle of joy onto the Jig. Once positioned properly, start clamping the veneers to the Jig at the low spots. I recommend using pieces of scrap wood between your clamps and the wood so that there is no damage in the final product.\nFinal Check:\nThis step has been done correctly when wood glue is oozing out from the edges of the veneers and you can see the longboard beginning to take shape. Take a look around the entire jig to make sure it is evenly clamped. Once you deem the wood to be in the proper place tighten each clamp a bit more and leave it to dry for at least 24 hours.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBR/16BE/JOONKSFG/FBR16BEJOONKSFG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKW/YLNT/JOONKSFI/FKWYLNTJOONKSFI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI6/VLZU/JOONKSFJ/FI6VLZUJOONKSFJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDH/J8EO/JOONKSFK/FDHJ8EOJOONKSFK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG0/C67U/JOONKSFM/FG0C67UJOONKSFM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNP/LLUZ/JOONKTTH/FNPLLUZJOONKTTH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Jig'n the Board"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "After 24 hours you may remove the veneer collection from the Jig and it should remain in the shape that it had been in for the last day.

If you have a different design this same technique can be used, or you can freehand a drawing onto the veneer collection and measure with a ruler for accuracy.\nAfter getting the general shape of your board down, you can go through and change it up by hand.

Being careful not to cut yourself, leave about 1/4\" of space between the blade and the lines of the board so that you can sand the deck to its final shape.\nSanding:\nCarefully use a belt sander to remove most of the remaining material and then sand the edges by hand to remove any burrs. When sanding by hand, go from a light grit sandpaper to a heavy grit sandpaper in small increments. I suggest starting at 100 and working your way up to 500 grit so that the final product is smooth and splinter-free.\nDrilling the holes:\nThe holes of trucks are fairly standardized but have been known to be slightly different depending on brand, so where your holes go are a mix of personal preference and factory specifications. For this step I took my board to a skate shop where an employee was able to line the trucks and mark where the holes should go. Once the location is marked, take a hand drill or use a drill press and drill them out. Make sure that your hole is a bit smaller than the hardware that you will be using for your trucks, that way the trucks don't become loose from the deck.\nLacquering the Deck:\nWood lacquer is a substance which will make the board watertight and durable.

This is the part that really makes the board your own, but before I did any of this I added something that I had never done before: LED lights.\nAdding the Lights:\nIn order to add in the lights, I carefully dug a channel along the side of the board with a rotary tool. I made this channel slightly smaller than the LED light strip I was going to put in it so that the pressure of the wood would hold it in place. The battery compartment was command-striped to the bottom of the deck, and another coat of lacquer was added so that no water seeped into the channel.\nGrip Tape:\nI combined my love for stickers and my desire to make my board stand out by adding stickers not just to the bottom of the deck but to the top as well. I positioned the stickers on the deck and then rolled on a layer of clear grip tape. Applying the grip tape is simple as it's essentially a giant sandpaper sticker. Once the grip tape is rolled on, rub a piece of metal against the edge of the board. This creates a weak point in the deck so that the excess grip tape can easily be cut off with a sharp knife.\nNow that your board is grip taped and decorated, all you have to do is add trucks and wheels and you're longboard will be complete!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F97/VBPH/JOONKZSO/F97VBPHJOONKZSO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKP/J20F/JOONL0H4/FKPJ20FJOONL0H4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F60/XOZL/JOONL0CW/F60XOZLJOONL0CW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEN/EX36/JOONKZT7/FENEX36JOONKZT7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQT/QSRA/JOONKZT8/FQTQSRAJOONKZT8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM5/91RM/JOONKZT9/FM591RMJOONKZT9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYY/M1RO/JOONKZTB/FYYM1ROJOONKZTB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Add the Fun Stuff"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Now you have completed your longboard!

How could I get the right dimensions and angles on the mansard roof? I'm sure there are other ways to do this, but this is the approach I settled on and the results were good.\nI started on my front wall and drew two 2\" by 1/8\" (the thickness of the wood) segments and rotated them 45 degrees, putting them in place on the roof. Then I used my pen tool to click around these two sides, creating a trapezoid shape that represented the 'front view' of my roof. I saved this to a new layer. Then I did the same for my sides, creating a side view of my roof, and moved that to another layer. My task now is to rotate these 'views', which are leaning back at a 45 degree angle, upright into the shapes I need to cut on my laser cutter.\nFor each, I went through this process: I created a new shape that was 2\" high (I had determined this from the start, when I created my 2\" segments), and whose bottom length matched my view. The dimension I didn't know was the size of the top. I knew it was bigger than that of my view, I just don't know how much bigger. So I started at an arbitrary size and then selected effect>3D>rotate>position>front and set it to rotate back 45 degrees. Illustrator shows you what that shape looks like when rotated back 45 degrees. I then used the direct selection tool to move the top points as necessary to get a perfect fit; it took about three iterations to get it just right.

I did the timbers last, with a single coat of Citadel shade paint, which is transparent and allows the wood grain to show through.

For drilling the inner diameter and outer diameter I used diamond hole saws that I got on amazon for $20. Drill the inner diameter that corresponds to the size you want then change the bit to a larger whole saw without moving the material on the drill table.

More tape for bigger rings and less for smaller rings. Now this might seem very strange and undorthodox but it produces really nice rings. Now the good thing about using the holes saws is that it leaves is with not much heavy sanding to do. We want the wall of the ring to be at max .125\u201d thickness. I find that any thicker then that leaves a very bulky ring. So I use very rough sandpaper starting at 36 grit to remove lots of material, moving up to 220 to get out all the scratches. With the drill in a vice, press the tigger with your left hand while you sand the ring with your right hand. In total the range of sand paper will be 36-2000 grit.

It's a modern ritual where, during your wedding you seal up a bottle of wine inside a box along with love letters written to one another. Five years later on your anniversary you open the box, drink the wine, and read the letters! We just had our five year anniversary and we really enjoyed opening our first box, drinking the wine together, and reliving the memories of our wedding. As the bottle neared empty and our creativity soared, we thought it would be a really fun project to build a new wine box together for our next five years of adventures.\nA wine box is also a great Christmas and holiday gift for your friends and loved ones. With our design, the removable divider makes it easy to re-purpose the box as well, giving it even more utility.\nThis box is heavily inspired by Matt Kenney's work and his book, \"52 Boxes in 52 Weeks\".\nCheck it out here! \u25ba https://amzn.to/2DHHEAh\nTOOLS USED:\n4\" Combination Square\nClamps\nTape Measure\nPencil - Chisel\nUtility Knife\nFabric Iron\nSandpaper\n#4 Smoothing Plane\nRouter Plane\nBench Vice\nShooting Board (Not Required)\nX-Carve CNC (Not Required) - https://bit.ly/2vyBZGM\nPlaner (Not Required)\nJointer (Not Required)\nBandsaw (Not Required)\nTablesaw (Not Required)\nMATERIALS:\nWhite Oak (Quartersawn)\nTeak\nFabric\nWood Glue\nBlue Tape (Painter's Tape)\nSpray Adhesive\nTwo Small Nails\nWine", "title": "Modern Wine Box", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Modern-Wine-Box/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "For the sides of the box we used a piece of white oak. The first step was to rough cut it to size and mill it.

This was so we could use the middle which had the straightest grain pattern.\nFrom there we used the jointer to flatten/straighten one face and edge. We then resawed the board in half at the bandsaw which gave us two pieces.

To cut the miter joints we're using a cross cut sled on the tablesaw with an angled blade that is specifically setup to cut miters. This helps with accuracy and ensures that the joints are a clean, crisp 45\u00b0.\nIn our case we trimmed our four sides to their exact length before trimming off the 45\u00b0 slivers at the end. This helps ensure accuracy in the length so that the box is square when it goes together.\nOnce the miters are cut the next step was to cut a 1/8\" deep rabbet joint on the top and bottom of each piece. This will create a groove around the top and bottom of the box when it goes back together that will house the top and bottom of the box. We made them exactly the same depth and width to simplify the build process but also because we're targeting perfect symmetry for the top and bottom.\nOnce everything was cut we did a dry assembly of the four sides so that we could start to work on the top and bottom of the box.

We thought the defect would be perfect for the top of the box to offset the otherwise perfect symmetry and simplicity of the design.\nAfter milling the two pieces and cutting them down to size using the same methods as before, we cross cut one side of the top to place the defect exactly where we wanted it and then used the shooting board to true up the end to perfect square. Not only does this get us perfectly square but it's the best way to shave off the tiniest amount of material from the end to get a perfect fit.\nWe started with one end, then held the lid in the place to mark the length for the other end, leaving a tiny bit of extra so that we could trim to a perfect fit again on the shooting board.\nLastly we used the handplane with the board in the vise to trim the width until it was a perfect fit.

The divider will then slide into the groove from the top and can be taken out to give the box a little more utility.\nTo cut the dado, we put a flat-toothed rip blade in our tablesaw and then adjusted the height of the tablesaw to 1/8\". We then pass the piece over the blade to cut the dado 1/8\" into the inside of our long sides.\nThis is a fast technique but can leave a slightly uneven surface so we use a router plane to clean up the joint.\nWith the dado finished we then fit the divider on the shooting board.

A great trick we learned from Fine Woodworking magazine is to use a plastic straw and push it through the corner to capture any glue that is squeezing out. This is a great technique!\nBefore the final tape goes on we check for square and then tape it tightly together.

We rough cut a piece and then used an iron to get it nice and flat and remove the wrinkles.\nWe then used a spray adhesive to attach the fabric to the inside of the bottom of the box. After about 15 minutes it's dry and we flipped it over and used a utility knife to trim off the excess.\nWith that finished we then applied glue to the inside of the rabbets on the bottom using a toothpick.

This gives the wood a really nice luster.\nTo finish the box we used shellac. We love this finish because it's easy to apply and we can get many coats on in a matter of hours. We applied it with a foam brush and put on 3 coats.\nFor the inside, we taped off the fabric with blue painter's tape to protect it and then finished it the same way.\nWhen the finish is completely dry it's very glossy.

As with the wood, I sanded in the same direction as the grain would lie, hoping that the effect would complement the grain of the wood (enough woods in that sentence to make a forest\u2026).\nNext I super-glued the end of the tube in the top of the log, ensure you get about 20mm of the tube inserted into the log for strength. Give it about 20 seconds then you can start on the next - and the next - and the next.... You need to pop the segment onto the tube and move it to the desired distance from the previous one. From there, you drop a ring of superglue around the connection between the tube and wood.

I drew around the controller and then drilled out the section. Final shaping was done with a chisel and file.\nBefore fixing the electrics I went over the whole piece with the oil. To get in between the segments I used a paintbrush.\nFinally, I folded the LED strip over itself. It has a sticky backer which means you can fix the two halves together. I found that sanding the acrylic didn't quite diffuse the light enough to disguise the LED strip. To solve this I popped a small sheet of tissue paper around the strip.

We mixed them together and stirred them for about 2 minutes with a cordless drill and a paint stirer. Mix until you think its enough and then mix some more.\nMake sure to scrap the sides really good.

Please note!\nInstructables member gendragonfly asked me to give a special safety explanation about working with these UV lights! Well, I agree fully with his explanation and that\u00b4s why I copy his comment here.\ngendragonfly writes:\n\"Just a safety tip for anyone who wants to build this project: UV wavelengths below 315 nm are harmful to the skin (not just the eyes) ! And the shorter they get the more damaging they are. If at all possible try using an LED for this build without the small peak at 245 nm, this is UV-C radiation and can be very harmful. Curing LED's (like the one used in this project seems to be) often have several peaks because its helpful in speeding up the curing process, it is however not good for your skin. (That's why they are only allowed to be used in closed environments where the harmful light can't escape.) Even at the low energy levels of one or two LED's long term exposure will still do damage. A black light LED (400 nm) or an LED that produces only one wavelength between 385-415 nm would be fine for this project and way safer. Anything below 380 nm isn't visible anyway, so unless your trying to get a tan, try to stay away from the shorter wavelengths. I hope, even though we all like shiny things with a nice patina, we also like to keep our DNA in one piece ;)\"\nAnd I want to add, that in this project I exactly followed these rules and used UV LED with 385 nm and 405 nm and tried to avoid a direct beam of UV Light to the eyes by this special construction!!\nQuinine has like all other fluorescence stuff a special fluorescence spectrum which you can see here. To get the best result I worked with High Power UV-LED of two different wavelengths 385 nm and 405 nm. These LED take 500 mA each while working. A \"classic\" LED take 20 mA! I also used a borosilicate glass bottle which is the only glass that let UV-light come in and out without a quality loss.\nA turbid lemonade with quinine spreads the light better than a clear one like tonic water, that\u00b4s why I chose this lemonade after testing various sorts.\nUV light at such a high power level and on these wavelengths is very dangerous to the human eyes and that is why I placed one LED under the bottom of the glass and the top LED in the sanded neck, so no one gets a direct beam of the UV light but everyone can enjoy the mystic (and not dangerous) blue-green light coming out of the bottle.\nVery often I am asked for the electrical /schematic, so here it is....", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F33/KQ1K/JOEVYHOI/F33KQ1KJOEVYHOI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKT/F72K/JOENIWWR/FKTF72KJOENIWWR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9V/FNPC/JOENIXQU/F9VFNPCJOENIXQU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU8/24FX/JOENIXWH/FU824FXJOENIXWH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Some Theoretical Background Information"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "One day my local plumber gave me a brass made pump case out of his scrap container and asked me to create a new stylish steampunk object.

The owner had left it outside, so it was a bit weathered. The first thing to do was to prepare the top. I cleaned up the back edge using a track saw and then squared up the two sides with a miter saw. Next, I used a handheld belt sander to even out the surface. When using a belt sander like this, especially on a soft wood such as pine, make sure to constantly move the sander. Check for raised spots with a straight edge and sand those down. Once the weathering was removed and the top was flat, I noticed a few cracks. I thought this would be a great chance to practice bow-ties, so I made a few black walnut bow-ties to hold the cracks together. Here is the link to the video I followed. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfBcEvssM9I . Now to clean up the live edge. I wanted to square up the bottom part, so I used a flush trim bit to square up the bottom half of the live edge to make it more like a live chamfer.

The narrowest part of the top is 18\u201d so I decided to design the base to be 14\u201d deep. The right side will be a cabinet with drawers and left side will have two legs.\nThe first step of the cabinet is to cut the legs. The legs\nare made from fir 4x4s cut down to 3\u201dx3\u201d to make the proportions look better. To make the inside a little bigger, I cut the inside corners off the legs, but this turned out to be unnecessary. The front two legs are part of the face of the cabinet. The rungs are attached using pocket hole screws. The nice thing about cutting the corners out of the legs is that the back side of the rungs are even with the cutout. To be able to use the clamp with the offset, I cut a spacer to make up the difference between the thickness of the rungs and the thickness of the leg. To make a solid piece wide enough for the back, I had to glue two pieces together. The method I used in shown in this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfnYGvsCQag Normally I would use biscuits, but I didn\u2019t feel like waiting for the glue to dry so I glued it and used more pocket holes alternating direction to hold the pieces together. I then cut the back to length and width. The back is attached to the two back legs using pocket holes just like the rungs on the front. The sides were cut so that the total depth would be 14\u201d these hold the back to the front and are again attached using pocket hole screws.

The drawer fronts I picked from good looking sections of my boards and cut to allow for a \u00bc\u201d gap with a flush fit. To ensure that the gap is even, I first mounted the box to the drawer slides, then glued the front on with the drawer closed. While the glue was still wet, I shimmed the gaps until they were even around all sides. I held the drawer front in place with two nails that will be covered up by the handle later.

This wallet is a two step cut that involves flipping the piece over so its super important to line everything up correctly. We aligned the the file to be centered over the 0,0 point and also marked the center of the board we are cutting. We will always reference this center point and to make things even easier we added a small hole to be cut in the center so when we flip the board we just line the machine back up to the center.\nNow that we have the wooden part cut out, we can get to play around with inserts. We love that this design can be modified by using different materials for both the body of the wallet and the insert on the front. We used the inlay generator on Easel to cut a piece to fit in the pocket on the front of the wallet. For the first wallet we choose to use black acrylic and engraved WB in the bottom right corner.

To be very honest, before doing this project I didn\u2019t even remember when was the last time I had cut wood. I still don\u2019t. I didn\u2019t choose to do this project because I\u2019m particularly good at this kind of thing. I haven\u2019t taken an arts & crafts class in over a decade. I chose this project because I\u2019ve always been a bookworm and I own lots of books -- I never really got used to eReaders... Even my grandma surrendered to the Kindle and I still haven\u2019t. My personal library has undergone near exponential growth since I went to college and, for that reason, I had to figure out how to keep it organized.\nBut that\u2019s my story\u2026 What made you click on this thumbnail?\nDo you own books? Do you collect issues of a particular magazine? Do you have dozens of comics in your room?

(see photos and drawings)\nThe first 2 down tubes - for the 10mm and 13 mm screws - are installed on the movable guides so that the screws fall down them reliably: Short screws with large heads tend to overbalance and fall to the front of the sorting plate rather than going backwards through the slot.\nA 70mm entry slot is needed in these first 2 tubes with the bottom edge of the slot bent out about 2mm towards the sorting plate. This is to deflect falling screws into the tube and stop them jamming against the sorting plate, and the reason for the long slot is so that 62mm screws (the longest that this machine can sort) will clear the bent tab on the bottom of the slot.\nA section is cut out of one side of each tube to allow the screws to fall through. The cut outs on tubes 3 - 10 are 5 mm longer than the step in the sorting plate. A short (broken) jigsaw blade in the jigsaw cuts the slot very well, but a hacksaw can be used. A router with a flush trim cutter is ideal to take off the last little bit of aluminium left over from the jigsaw cut. A file can be used but its messier and takes longer.\nThe 62 mm down tube is shorter than the rest to allow enough clearance for the 62 mm screws to exit the tube,\nThe eight tubes are screwed to the battens with countersunk 12mm screws. 8mm access holes are drilled in the lower portion of the tube so that the screw head and the screw driver fit through. (see photos)\nThe tubes are kept perpendicular to the battens and with their tops aligned and the lower screw installed first, because the limited access makes it much harder if the tubes are already fixed at the upper end.\nIf the assembly is done with the battens between the fixed uprights, it is much easier to maintain spacing and orientation. 1.5mm plastic spacers are placed between each tube to ensure a consistent spacing. Each tube is held hard up against the spacer while drilling the pilot holes. Tubes are positioned and screwed down one at a time.\nOnce completed, the tube array is used to mark out the steps on the sorting plate. It is important that the steps on the sorting plate extend to the inner edge of the next largest tube. If they are short of this, screws fall out the front instead of going down the tubes. (See photo of wrongly cut section)\nOnce the plate is cut out and screwed into position, the tube array is placed against the plate, 1mm clear of the the flat aluminium guide at the top.

Don't screw the angle on yet.\nTo prevent jamming of screws in the V-shaped feeder section, the vertical part of the upper (front) movable guide was cut off, beginning at the rear of the right hand support block, and going to the feed-in end of the angle. Although this reduced jamming, removal of this vertical section meant that the remaining thin horizontal aluminium strip was not well supported, which caused even worse problems! The solution was to bolt a peice of steel 1.6 mm x 20 mm x 100mm underneath the flat guide to stiffen it. (see photos) The bolts used are the ones that hold the guide onto the aluminium. At first I thought that putting this extra thickness of plate under the guide would raise it up and make it uneven, but this is not discernible and doesn't negatively affect the sorting. Jamming is vastly reduced, and sorting is much better.\nTo improve sorting of short screws with large heads the upper movable) guide needs to be cut to allow these screws to fall away from the sorting plate rather than through it.\nWhy do this? Many short screws with large heads have their point of balance exactly where the head meets the screw shaft. When these screws tilt down to go through the slot, they typically strike the slot about \u00bd way along the screw thread, (past the point of balance in the wrong direction) which causes the screw to fall backwards against the movable guide, and get stuck there, blocking the movement of all the screws that are banked up behind it.\nIf there is a slot just where the edge of the screw head would strike on its way to resting against the guide, the screw falls back through this slot and is guided down into the receiver tray through the front down tube.\nShort stainless steel ramps behind the 10mm and 13 mm slots ensure that all screws are directed back down the front of the sorting plate and into the collection tray.\nWhere the guide goes past the 62mm downtube, a notch must be cut out of the vertical part of the movable guide, to approximately 1 mm below the upper face of the lower (fixed) guide.\nThis is necessary because when 62mm screws tilt through the 25 mm down tube, the point of the screw touches the back of the tube before the screw has enough angle to fall off the guide and into the tube.\nBy doing this modification, when the screw head tilts, the edge of it goes into the cutaway and it falls off the guide and into the tube.\nScrew the Aluminium guide to the top of the movable uprights.\nFit the 30mm springs over the through bolts, with a washer over the spring\nFit the movable uprights onto the through bolts and secure with: 1 x washer, 1 x 6 mm adjustable nut and a 6 mm wingnut. There is a 30mm x 6mm x 2mm piece of steel welded to the nut which makes adjustment easy. (see photo) It is less tedious than using a spanner to adjust a nyloc nut, and unlike a nyloc nut, it doesn't wear out. The wing nut locks the adjustment in place.

The feed tin consists of 2 parts: The \u201ccircular\u201d tin, which is actually a 12-sided tin, and a \u201cV\u201d shaped chute to interface with the feed ramp.\nThis assembly was made from stainless steel because it is easy to spot weld. After making a number of cardboard models, the components were cut out, folded and spot welded together.\nAfter welding, the base of the \u201cround\u201d tin was domed upwards using a ball-pein hammer so that screws are forced to congregate around the edges.\nInitially the vibration in this tin tended to be under-damped and it threw screws everywhere. Carefully taping the inside of the tin with Gaffer tape largely fixed this, but even so, screws cannot be put into the feed tin until the machine is up to speed, because it goes through some extreme resonances on the way up to working speed. Taping the inside of the tin also caused a large drop in the noise of rattling screws. (Yay!)\nOnce the unit is assembled, it is screwed to the fixed part of the feed ramp with 2 x 4mm screws, allowing a clearance of 3 \u2013 4 mm above the bottom of the \u201cV\u201d of the feed ramp. In practice, some bending/tilting of the assembly will probably be needed to get the screws to move smoothly around the edge and feed into the delivery chute, not just all gushing out the exit together. When locating the attachment screws, it works best to just put 1 screw in place, move the feed tin up & down until an optimal feed rate is reached, then drill the other hole and put the other screw in.\nIn operation, a handful of screws can be dumped into the tin, and they will (with some help) proceed around the outside of the tin until they fall out into the delivery chute.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRG/PVSV/JM6KRJ8W/FRGPVSVJM6KRJ8W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB6/SSDA/JM8AT9SU/FB6SSDAJM8AT9SU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDP/LNHF/JM8AT9SQ/FDPLNHFJM8AT9SQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: The Feed Tin:"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "Because this sorter was built to sort all kinds of different sized screws, inevitably there are larger and smaller gauge screws in the mix.

A larger hole is then drilled in the tin to accommodate the screw shaft.\nMy tin has a 12mm deep cutaway at the end where the screws feed into the guides from the feed ramp, because longer screws would otherwise hit the edge and stop.

Short screws with large heads tend to sit upside down.\nTo sort screws of all different gauges, the gap between the guides must be altered for each gauge/head size.\nIf you look carefully at the other online videos, you may notice that the screws being sorted are all the same gauge, head size and design, and are fed very carefully and sparingly. I have tried to make this machine flexible enough to sort a variety of screws, but there are limitations....\nTo use the machine with a lot of mixed screws, it's best to do an initial sort to classify the screws roughly into gauge/head size:\nSet the guides so that they will correctly sort the largest screw that you have in the mix\nTurn on the machine and put a good handful of screws into the feed tin. They need to end up in single file as they come off the feed ramp. They will mostly sort according to head size, and many will also sort into their \u201cproper\u201d size bin.\nWatch out for odd size or larger screws jamming in the slot. If this happens, dig the screw out with long nosed pliers & sort it later.\nOnce the preliminary sort is done, you will see that many of the screws have fallen into the overflow tin, and the rest are roughly sorted into length/head/ gauge size. . (see video)\nSometimes it may be advantageous to re-sort each tray individually because when the screws are all \u201csimilar\u201d they tend to interfere with one another less, and this gives a better outcome.\nStarting with the largest gauge screws, re-set the guides to the correct width for the screw size & re- sort them for length.\nRepeat this with the screws that fell into the overflow tin.\nDuring the initial sort for gauge, some screws fall directly through the guides without going through the tubes, especially if they have small heads and in this case their direction is fairly random and they sometimes bounce out of the collection boxes and onto the floor. A plywood petition can be put at the front will minimise this.\nPositives:\nThe machine works best on countersunk screws longer than 25 mm, will handle partially or fully threaded shanks and thread types, and sorts screws down to 10 mm.\nThe critical dimension is the screw head size, and to a lesser extent, the screw shaft size, as these determine the spacing between the guides and therefore, which screws will sort properly.\nThough it might seem tedious, It is faster and easier than sorting screws by hand, and differentiates well between screws of only slightly different lengths\nOnce it is properly set up to sort screws of the same design and gauge, it is fast and reliable.\nNegatives:\nIt's not 100% accurate, especially with mixed screws of different gauges.\nAny screw that is very short and fat can't be sorted by this machine. (see photos) Screws or bolts with heads that are large or flanged, or very deep or very small in relation to their thread gauge, bolts with fitted washers or screws or those that have hexagon heads, will not sort properly, no matter what their length. They either fall off the end, get jammed in the feed chute or the guides, or sort into the wrong box.\nIf a screw gets jammed it dampens the vibration and causes the screws behind it to bank up and it must be manually removed.\nWhenever head & shaft sizes change, the guides must be reset at both ends using a sample screw to check for free passage. (See Felix's video for adjustment procedure) This only takes a couple of minutes.\nThe receiver bins on this machine don't hold enough screws although with slight modification they could be made 2 or 3 times deeper.\nThe machine can be noisy unless the speed is carefully controlled.\nAt certain vibration speeds and specially at startup, the feed hopper can go into wild resonance and throw screws everywhere.

In our latitudes the sun generates up to 1000 Watts per m\u00b2. With photovoltaic panels we can capture 200 W / m\u00b2, with thermal energy it rises to 800W / m\u00b2, four times more! Solar panels are much more profitable than photovoltaic panels and much less expensive. The \"home made\" solution Eric Lafond offers us easily reaches 500W / m\u00b2 for a cost of 15 \u20ac per m\u00b2. This [1] shows the solar power you can expect to receive, depending on your geographical position and the season.\nSolar thermal panels are particularly useful for domestic hot water production. In this case they are called solar water heaters.\n3 - 4m\u00b2 (32 - 43 sq feet) of solar thermal panels will cover 90% of the hot water needs for a two person household throughout the year. The hot water tank will take over during cloudy days. If there are more inhabitants, and therefore more water being consumed, you need to increase the size of the solar panels. For example, 6m\u00b2 (64.5 sq feet) for 6 people.\nEric's complete system - which includes home-made panels, supply pipes, coolant, solar balloon, circulator, and a regulator - will be profitable in two to three years. The panels installed at his house are in their eighteenth year.\nThese thermal panels are designed in the same way as those on the market: a solar collector containing a heat transfer fluid is sandwiched between an insulator and a sheet of glass. In this case, we will use the grill you find at the back of a fridge for the solar collector.. And we will use the door of the fridge as the insulator. The glass is from old double glazed windows. You will find many fridges in landfills or recycling areas, and double-glazing windows at many glaziers.\nA big thank to Rik\u00e9, who shared his know-how with us, from his 20 years of experience in the world of energy, and to the members of the Grand Moulin collective who welcomed us to the training they organized, particularly to Karine, Sylvain and Pascal. Thanks also to Jean-Loup for the explanation of glass cutting and soldering, and to all the other volunteers of the participative building site for their help.", "title": "Solar Water Heater", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Solar-Water-Heater-2/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The thermal solar panels that we are building will have to be installed facing directly south, ideally forming an angle of 60\u00b0 with the horizon, (or vertically on the outside wall, if the former is not possible). Rooftop usage of these panels is much less efficient in the winter and causes overheating in the summer (more details in the installation phase).\nInertia\nTo maximize the effectiveness of the thermic solar energy, it is necessary to minimize the inertia in the light uptake and to maximize it in the storage or the diffusion. The panels work as soon as there is a sunbeam thanks to their low inertia. The heat is retained for a long time with its great volume and its good insulation.\nThe pipes of the refrigerator grill have a small diameter (4mm), so there is a low volume of heat transfer fluid to heat in the panel. This low inertia quickly increases the temperature as soon as the sun appers from behind the clouds and then heats the hot water balloon. The greater the diameter of the pipes, the more time it needs to heat the larger volume of fluid. and the less efficient the system becomes.\nTo ensure the temperature of the panels increases quickly, the space between the insulation and the glass need to be as small as possible. So the panel has to be as thin as possible, whilst ensuring that the grid doesn't touch either the insulator nor the glass. Otherwise those elements will conduct heat away from the panels.\nTemperature\nThe temperatures can exceed 150\u00b0C (302\u00b0F) inside the panel, so it is essential to use materials resistant to heat and to UV radiations. Do not use sticks or paints with solvents which are not resistant to UV radiations. Here, we use PU putty and acrylic paint. For a good longevity, also make sure to use rot-proof local wood.\nOn winter nights, it can get very cold inside the panel. The different materials, insulation, metal, wood and glass will expand differently between winter night and summer sun. The joints that unite them must be thick to absorb the deformation, if they are not thick enough they will tear off.\nGrid\nThe specific feature and ingenuity of these solar thermic panels is the use of refrigerator grills. But beware, not all grills are good and they must be used in the right direction! The grills must be provided with cooling fins and painted black (see photo). They must not be in galvanized steel, as the paint will not adhere. Similarly, some refrigerators are equipped with pipes connected by wire, but the surface of these grids is insufficient for this use.\nThe right grilles have a direction of assembly, the fins, comparable to louvers, must capture the sun. In a sense the sun will pass through, it's bad, in the other direction it will capture the rays, it's the good sense! They must be perpendicular to the sun's rays.\nTip: take the grid and lift it between the sun and yourself, in one sense the rays will pass and not in the other.\nRefrigerating gas\nRefrigerator grills are covered by a refrigerant, harmful to the environment, the greenhouse effect and the ozone layer. In France the refrigerating gases must be recovered. However, there are exemptions for equipment containing less than 3 kg of fluid until 2025. The domestic installations (refrigerator and air conditioner) are degassed before continuing their upgrading process. We can open the circuit without too much conscience.\n\nBe careful, you will do something that may involve risks.\nThe information and advice given in this tutorial come from joint workshops and are neither perfect nor exhaustive. If you don't have certain tools or if you don't feel competent, don't hesitate to ask around for help. Remember to wear your safety equipment, to work in ventilated areas and do not put yourself in danger.

In other words, the apparent surface of the panel, seen from the sun, is reduced with the angle.\nthe glass reflects the rays, if the rays arrive perpendicular to the glass, all enter the panel, the more the angle increases, the higher the proportion of reflected rays is. Solar panels are rarely mobile and their angle is therefore fixed to the installation. Solar power is much stronger in summer than in winter, not to mention the length of days. Solar energy is at least three times more important in summer than in winter (see tutorial energy in the home), so the panels are sized and oriented for the most critical period: winter.\nIn the middle of winter, in France, the sun has a zenith at 30\u00b0 with the horizon, this is its maximum height. In summer, at the same latitudes, it rises to 60\u00b0. Ideally, the panels will be installed at a 60\u00b0 angle to the horizon, south-facing. Otherwise, to limit the losses, one can put them vertically against a wall, it is more interesting and less dangerous than on roofs.\nIn summer, the solar power being much more important, the angle does not matter, the panels will quickly be very hot, even too much. A shading is interesting to limit overheating, a cap on a vertical panel does very well.\nPlumbing =\nThe solar thermal panels must be positioned as close as possible to the hot water tank to minimize heat loss.\nThe panels must be connected to an exchanger tank. In addition to the standard electrical resistance, an exchanger passes the heat transfer fluid through the storage tank to transfer heat from the panels to the domestic water. You can find these exchange tanks in DIY stores. They cost 15 to 30% more than 100% electric balloons but will pay for themselves very quickly. Otherwise, some good tutorials allow you to make them yourself from a classic tank.\nThe system must be equipped with a regulator and a circulator. In our case the circulator is switched on when the temperature of the panels is 10\u00b0C higher than that of the storage tank, it is switched off when this difference is less than 5\u00b0C. This prevents the balloon from cooling at night or when the sun is shy. The tank is also equipped with an expansion vessel to absorb the expansion of the heat transfer fluid on sunny days. These elements are generally supplied with the solar heat exchangers. You can also make them yourself.\nIt is advisable to use a heat transfer fluid in the system.

Moreover, the energy required for heating the house is 6 times greater than that of hot water (see tutorial energy in the home), so it will require 6 times more panels for heating than for hot water.

At this point I haven\u2019t cut any new column to length yet. It is important to cut them as you install them due to settling and whatever adjustments that was made to the existing columns when they were installed. So, I measured the existing column I was about to replace and transferred that measurement to the new column. Cutting these columns weren\u2019t the easiest task, but with a couple of sawhorses and a mobile shop cart it wasn\u2019t too bad.\nSo, I used my Mobile Shop Cart with my miter saw attached to cut the columns. Since the columns were heavy and hard to manage, I laid it across the sawhorses and positioned my cart under the cutting end of the column to cut it to length.

If you\u2019re using a circular saw make sure you make your marks all the way around the column to help guide you as you rotate it for each cut. Once you have the column cut to length, add a base to the bottom. I used a galvanized post base on each of my new columns.

You also need a floor jack for this project to raise the porch a little. The support post and jack work together, which is why the support post needs to be a certain length to work properly. First of all, depending on what floor jack you\u2019re using, figure out the height range the floor jack will go, then measure the total length of the existing column you\u2019re about to remove. Subtract the mid range measurement of the floor jack from the total length of the existing column and cut the support post to that measurement. For example, if your floor jack has a range of 5 to 13 inches and the total length of the existing column is 87 inches, you would subtract 9 from 87, which is 78 inches. 78 inches is the length you would want to cut the support post to. The goal here is to not have the support post too short.\nAfter cutting the support post to length, you can place it on the floor jack next to the column you\u2019re about to replace. Leave a gap big enough to install a bigger column back in the same location (and to get a reciprocating saw between). Using the jack handle, slowly jack the support post up until it reaches the header. Before you go any further, make sure the support post is centered and secure on the floor jack and level. Continue to jack the support post up until you can slightly move the existing column. At this point you want to remove the existing column by cutting it into with a reciprocating saw. Be sure to cut away from the support post and jack and NOT towards it. You don\u2019t want to knock the support post off the jack.

Position the new column so that it\u2019s relatively in the same place as the old one. Using a level, make sure the new column is level from from left to right and front to back. Once you have it leveled and you\u2019re happy with its placement, slowly let the support post down by twisting the floor jack handle. Depending on what jack you\u2019re using, it may release different than twisting the handle. Regardless, release the pressure of the jack slowly until the support post comes loose.

Ask a hundred kids and seventy-five will tell you they want to be a youtube star some day. It's this same allure that got me started with recording the things I make around my shop.\nNot having ever been a part of the video scene, I didn't know much about camera set ups or the importance of good camera placement to catch that perfect angle. I'm not now an expert, but I have learned a few things. One of those important lessons is that you need a sturdy foundation for a camera. Camera tripods are a fantastic way to get the stability you need but they come at a price: a huge footprint. My tripod alone, fully extended from the floor, has a 36\" diameter base. It's a tripping hazard and in my small shop can be quite awkward to place, not to mention how cumbersome getting that perfect shot can be!\nThe other important note to add to this is how dangerous those tripod stands can be, especially in a workshop. I'm not talking about tripping hazards, I'm talking about dangerously trying to align a shot while putting yourself in a position you wouldn't normally be in so that you can take advantage of that shot. This is something that is quite regular for me on my lathe, and it is, quite honestly, an accident that was bound to eventually happen.\nEnter my hanging cam stand. Now, in particular places in my shop where that 3' diameter no go zone makes filming at best difficult and worst, dangerous and impossible, I have a hands free, no footprint area I can easily move around in.

In this first step, we need to make the dowel extension, which is basically just splitting the dowel in half and re-gluing about an inch (2.5cm) on both the top and bottom. A small bolt will fill this channel later and allow the extension to slide up and down with the re-glued section working as static stops.\n1:03 (in the video)\nThe overall length of my hanging cam stand is about 40 inches (101cm), so that means I need to make my 3/4\" (20mm) dowel about 20 inches (50.5cm) long. I took a scrap 2x4x20\" (4cm x 9cm x 50.5cm) and made several passes to create a groove that was exactly equal or a hair less than my dowel. After I cut out the groove on the scrap wood I squeezed the dowel rod into the groove.\n1:15 (in the video)\nUsing a few drops of hot glue would be good at this point to keep the dowel in the jig while you run it through the tablesaw, or you could use another scrap of wood behind the dowel rod jig to chase it. You'll want to do this as not doing either of those two things will allow the rod to push through and come back at you dangerously. Find the dead center of the rod, center it on the tablesaw blade and cut that dowel in half.\n1:32 (in the video)\nOnce the dowel is split in half, cut two pieces of scrap wood into 1\" (2.5cm) long by 3/4\" (20mm) wide with a depth of about 3/16th of an inch (4.75mm). The thickness of this groove between the two glued points will need to be able to run the #6 2 1/2\" (4mm x 65mm) bolt, but not so thick that your new dowel assembly won't fit in the copper tube.\nAbout the best way I can suggest doing this is by setting your table saw and running the scrap of wood about 3/4th's the way through, turning off the saw and removing the board, then cutting the lengths of scraps to size.\n1:50 (in the video)\nIf you watch the video you'll see that I used a combination of hot glue and wood glue to form this newly slotted dowel rod.

Attach the other half of the paper a slight ways down from the other to make up for the size. Beware though, this is the only mount that I've tested. I do not know how it'll act with any other sizes, although I don't think it should be a problem.\nVery simply put, drill a hole through both holes on the template. These holes will be 3/4\" (20mm). Press an awl, or nail into the center X before you drill (so your drill bit doesn't wander) and be sure to keep your hole as straight as possible. The body will need to be cut out on a bandsaw or some type of handsaw. There are also cuts that will need to be made on both sides, up to the hole you drilled (3:18 in the video), but do NOT do that now, even though I did it in the video. I had to deal with chip out that could have ruined the entire thing.\n2:55 (in the video)\n* If I take the image and print it at in landscape at 40% reduced size, I can line a quarter up perfect to the quarter on the page.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FP0/QA0L/JNZ47J6C/FP0QA0LJNZ47J6C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1C/50KL/JNZ47J8T/F1C50KLJNZ47J8T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOQ/MUO0/JNZ47J7J/FOQMUO0JNZ47J7J.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Cutting Out the Head Plate"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Now let's put the dowels in and see how we're doing.\nIn one of the holes we're going to put the 3/4\" dowel that's 4 1/2 inches (11.5cm).

I'll be providing links to the updated set up here that will not be available elsewhere...you are lucky instructable patron!\nIn this step we will create knobs that will work in tandem with the bolt through the copper and your newly created dowel rod. Creating knobs could be an entirely different instructable altogether and can encompass many different tools. In this project I will make the knobs about as simple as I can make them using squares instead of circles.\nFirst, take your hardwood and cut 1 3/4\" (4.5cm) squares. Draw diagonals and in the center, drill holes in both that are larger than the t-nut barrel, on the underside. Press both into the holes, tap on the tops with a hammer, or heck, a brick, and pull the t-nut off. You'll see 4 indentations. Drill those indentations enough to get the prong width in and then press the t-nuts into the wood squares. Drill a couple of holes next to each t-nut and put a #6 1/2\" (4mm) rounded head sheet metal screws in each hole, securing the t-nut.\nNext, grab your bolt and put thread locker on the threads under the head and thread the bolt through face of the nut so that it protrudes out of the back of the knob. Add a #6 (4mm) washer to the bare wood side and push the bolt through both the copper tube and your new dowel rod center, adding another #6 (4mm) washer on the opposite side. Put the second knob on by running the bolt through the wood side this time and out the nut on the opposite side. Be sure to follow these instructions very carefully as t-nuts can push themselves out if you don't put them in correctly.\n0:00-1:30\n4:16 (in the main video)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCP/Z14M/JNZ49EPV/FCPZ14MJNZ49EPV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Adding the Bolt and Locking Knobs"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "I didn't make a video on the locking knobs for the camera head plate, but it's the same as step 5 locking knobs for the telescope, except that you will be using a large t-nut (5/16\" (8mm)) and 5/16 x 3\" (8mm x 80mm) carriage bolts. As far as drilling out the holes on the side for the locking part of the plate, I measured in 3/8\" by 3/8\" (9.5mm x 9.5mm) using a 3/8\" drill bit (9.5mm) in the video. WATCH the video, it makes this process much more self explanatory.\nAfter drilling the holes, cut through to the other holes drilled on top using a bandsaw. This kerf opening will allow the hole to squeeze and lock the shaft you put in.

The big advantage of the latter one is that they are thin and very, very sharp indeed, making them well-suited to cut through a variety of materials. Paper, cardboard, soft / thin wood, plastic, leather and so on can all be cut (mostly) easily and accurately with aforementioned razor blades.\nThe problem comes when cutting a lot of things and worsens if they are hard-to-cut materials such as leather. The thin metal backing of the razor blade really starts digging into your finger and hurts quite a bit, lessening the viability of this tool for cutting despite the often times superior sharpness.\nIf you have encountered this problem yourself, look no further for I bring you the solution right here:\nA variety of different grips for safety razor blades which cost maybe 10-20 cents and 1-3 hours each to print.\nNot only have I been testing these, I handed some of them over to a talented cosplaying friend of mine, Lie Chee (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook) for getting some additional feedback - she said she liked them quite a lot and apparently they're coming in handy with her new costume build.\nGoal(s):\nDesign a comfortable grip for single edge safety razor blades\nIf possible, make it a single piece\nMake it easily 3D-printable\nTry to keep compatibility for FDM, SLA / DLP, SLS, etc. as well as possible so anyone can print it\nSafety Advice:\nThis instructable makes use of 3D printers and razor blades. Especially the razor blades are very, very sharp and can cut you pretty badly, so remember to handle them with care. Also, 3D printer hotends are quite hot, so please don't burn your fingers either.", "title": "Single Edge Safety Razor Blade Grips", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Single-Edge-Safety-Razor-Blade-Grips/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Tools:\n3D printer / 3D printing service\nIf you don't have a printer, you can use a 3D printing service, e.g.:\n3dhubs\nShapeways\niMaterialise\n...\nSlicing software\nExacto knife (optional, for cleanup)\n3D design software (optional, if you want to recreate it)\nMaterials:\n3D printing supplies (if doing it yourself)\nSingle edge safety razor blades\nThat's about it. It's a nice, small and simple project which hopefully turns out to be useful to many crafters.\nIf you do not own a 3D printer yourself, the grip is fairly small and uses little material, which means it prints fast and should therefore be fairly cheap even if you need to outsurce the printing itself. If you have a printer yourself, a single grip should set you back maybe 5-20 cents (depending on which exact grip you are printing and how expensive of a filament you are using, provided you are using an FDM printer) and need 1-2 hours for a print, given 0.1mm layer height, 5 shells and 20% infill.\nFor fun I checked with 3Dhubs and the price estimate I got for these grips is 1-3 bucks per grip with 0.1mm resolution PLA on FDM printers. I believe this should be affordable enough for everyone, even if they do not own a printer themselves.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Tools and Materials"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Before you go on merrily designing away at your problem, you should first consider what material you want / need to make your item out of and which manufacturing technology you're going to use. Once you have decided on those, you can add the constraints resulting from your choices to all considerations you need for your item itself.\nBlade grips are quite often made from plastic if there is not much pressure or shearing forces involved. With safety razors, those should not be a problem, so I can use plastic to make a grip.\nManufacturing Technology:\nI own a 3D printer, namely a Prusa i3 MK3 which is an FDM printer - a Fused Deposition Modeling machine. These 3D printers take a roll of plastic filament string, heat it and deposit it on a build surface, adding layer after layer on top of the previously laid ones. 3D printers are great to make fairly complicated, functional parts with pretty darn decent accuracy which is perfect for this project.\nNow if one wishes for good printability and wants to avoid using supports and / or brims, a flat contact surface for good adhesion to the print bed ist the first constraint to add. The next problem is overhangs. Many printing technologies including FDM and SLS / DLP have a problem with printing shallow angles and need to generate support structures for those. As a rule of thumb, angles over 45 degrees from the printing plane are safe. In truth, if the portrusion is rather small, shallower angles are viable, but testing might be needed. Finally, as the material is deposited layer by layer but the fusion between layers is not that strong we need to make sure that any mechanical stress the part is exposed to does not run along those layer lines, otherwise the part may easily break.\nLastly you need to think of what margins to use between your parts, how much slack you can accoundt for so that everything fits nicely together. For instance of you design a hole of 1mm and want to insert a 1mm rod into it you might find that the printer was not perfectly accurate, that the part shrunk or that the fit is simply too tight for other reasons. As such, margins / offsets are needed. For fairly tight fits I typically use offsets of 0.1-0.2mm.\nMaterial Choice:\nThe material I want to use for printing is PLA, mainly as it is really easy to print with and no extensive post-processing of the print is to be expected. PLA is not as strong as ABS or PETG, but it should sufficient for this application.\nConstraint Summary:\nFlat side towards the print bed for good adhesion\nOverhang angles of 45 degrees or more\nExpected mechanical stress not along layer lines\nParts strong enough so the weaker PLA will still hold up\nOffsets / margins for accuracy\nThe razor blade has to fit snugly\nRough Design Concept:\nWhen cutting with a safety razor, most of the force and pressure is transmitted to the thin metal spine, that is to say away from the blade. Some force is directed at the back edge of the razor, away from the cut direction (basically drag). As such, that back and side of the safety razor must be held firmly and the grip must be solid there in order to withstand those forces.\nWith the spine being a bit thicker than the blade itself it can be used for positioning / holding / locking the blade in the grip. The same goes for the two cutouts at the sides of the blade.\nOne side must of course be open for the blade to portrude out of the grip and another may be open to insert the blade, or rather it needs some sort of locking mechanism if the grip is meant to be made from a single part only.\nAs such I decided to model the part upright with the razor blade edge perpendicular to the base surface. The bottom and back sides (blade spine) will be solid, the front have an open slit for the blade and the top will be a springy bit which can be pused aside to insert the blade, and locks it in if closed.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: Design Considerations / Technology Limitations / Rough Idea"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "With the material and manufacturing technology set one can start thinking about the proper design itself. Naturally, many ways lead to the end product, so I'll just show you mine. What I did, how and why I did it the way I did.\nI measured and sketched out the single edge safety razor blade dimensions (image #1).\nOptimally you'd accurately recreate the whole part, but for this simple of a project it is sufficient to know some key dimensions:\nBlade thickness, width and depth of blade to the spine\nSpine thickness, width and depth\nPosition and sizes of the side cutouts which are used to secure the blade\nDesign a basic outline of the blade grip (image #1)\nMake sure to leave an offset of 0.1-02.mm around the blade for a good fit\nMake sure the walls are thick enough to withstand the pressure from cutting. All walls I designed are typically 1.5mm thick or thicker, which ought to be solid enough.\nTaper the edges towards the cutting edge of the blade. This will make it feel less blocky and hopefully improve the ergonomics.\nForm the basic body shape (images #2 + #3)\nClosed bottom and back, open front and top\nMake sure to add a peg fitting the blade cutout for locking the blade at the bottom side\nMake it large enough to fit the whole blade height and add a bit on top\nAdd a top side locking peg (image #4)\nFirst slit the side with the locking peg so it can function as a spring\nNext add the locking peg to the top side. As this is an overhang, make sure to tilt it. However, to preserve the locking functionality an overhang angle of 45 degrees as usually suggested for easy support-free printing will be too steep. The good news is due to the relatively small width of the overhang and due to rounding it, I can get away with an overhang angle of 30 degrees which should work just fine.\nAdd opening aid (image #5)\nFunctionally, the previous step should be sufficient, but opening the blade grip and inserting the blade might be challenging. Therefore the springy locking side needs to be elongated a bit and an opening tab is added to make it easier to insert a blade.\nAdd a cutout on the non-springy side to accomodate for the opening tab\nAs the opening tab is an overhang, angle to bottom surface 45 degrees. Why not 30 degrees? Because the opening tab overhang is substantially larger than the locking peg and there is no functional reason for a shallower overhang\nRound outside edges (image #6)\nTo prevent annoying, sharp edges, round them over. It does not matter if the printer can not resolve them perfectly, it mainly serves to break up the sharp 90-degree-edges and reduces the need to hit the part with sandpaper after it has been printed\nOPTIONAL (image #7): Go wild with variants\nFor prototyping purposes I have settled on three different base widths: small, medium and large\nI have experimented with adding a finger rest for better anti-slip behavior and pressure application while cutting\nTo improve the grip even further I have experimented with knurling patterns", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJJ/3ZFL/JNOVINT3/FJJ3ZFLJNOVINT3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOH/DW3B/JNOVINUR/FOHDW3BJNOVINUR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFM/JXC0/JNOVINXJ/FFMJXC0JNOVINXJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEA/BEXX/JNOVINZJ/FEABEXXJNOVINZJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQK/DG15/JNOVINZK/FQKDG15JNOVINZK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEB/89ZL/JNOVINZL/FEB89ZLJNOVINZL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL1/YF4D/JNOVIO1N/FL1YF4DJNOVIO1N.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Design the Grip"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Living the Rapid Prototyping Dream:\nAs already shown in the previous step a single base model of the razor grip is not sufficient in my eyes. The combination of having the 3D design software, a 3D printer and the parts being fairly small and cheap really let me live out the concept of \"rapid prototyping\".\nFor starters after printing the initial, simple grip version I found that yes, it does mitigate the hurting-finger-problem, but it might do so even better. Therefore I designed two more versions with increasing thickness, named \"medium\" and \"large\" to see if these thicknesses would improve the handling in a noteworthy fashion.\nAt the same time I figured that a regular square design might not be the end-all-be-all of things. For instance, many craft knives feature a small portrusion towards the tip of the blade as a finger rest which allows to put more pressure on the tip while cutting. Seeing the value in that I whipped up a version which included that as well.\nLastly (for now), I have noticed that the blank sides are rather comfortable to hold, but may be a bit slippery. As I very much like good knurling on tools to improve the grip I decided to give it a try and followed some videos on youtube illustrating on how to do that with Fusion 360. I don't want to keep those from you, so here's the creme of the crop that I referenced:\nLars Christensen: \"Create Cool Patterns & Knurling for 3D Printing \u2014 Fusion 360 Tutorial \u2014 #LarsLive 116\"\nPaul McWhorter: \"Learn Fusion 360 or Die Trying LESSON 8: Design Knurled Nut and Bolt for 3D Printer\"\nSpark Plug: \"Creating a knurl surface / knurling - fusion 360 tutorial\"\nRadek Paszkiewicz: \"Fusion360 knurling\"\nI don't want to cheat you out of my prototypes, so you'll get all STL files at the end of this instructable. My personal favourite so far is the Medium one with Knurling and a Finger Rest. My cosplaying friend on the other hand preferred the Medium one with Knurling but without a Finger Rest.\nPrinting:\nGiven the design constraints that went into these models they sould all print fairly easily, which means no rafts, no supports, just straight up printing. With the razor grips being rather slim and tall a brim of 3-5mm is recommended, but that's easily removeable and does not use a lot of plastic. Therefore place the grips with the blade insertion opening facing upwards.\nI recommend printing the grips at a 0.1mm (100 micron) resolution due to some finer details and for a better fit of the razor blades. 5 shells and 20% infill should provide sufficient strength for its intended use. I have yet to break one despite putting considerable pressure on these when cutting hard materials.\nFor the knurled versions you may need to check your slicer settings and make sure that between the knurls there is at least one, better two traces / lines connecting the pyramidal shapes at their lowest (most inward) points.\nBy the way, this printing timelapse gif there is made from ~230 seperate images I took with my DSLR over about 8 hours (one every two minutes), edited and then stitched together into a simple ~15-second-gif (15fps). Praise be unto the software developers of the world for automatic timelapses and good image editing and stitching software.\nAlso, for the eagle-eyed viewers among you, don't mind the grimy-looking surface of my build plate - that's residue of 3DLAC which gets pushed around and accumulates when cleaning the build plate with IPA. So far I only hit my build plate twice with it and I'm 4 spools of filament in. Virtually no adhesion problems at all! That stuff's magic in a can, I really can't recommend it enough if you have adhesion problems with PLA.\nFinishing:\nThere should be barely any finishing necessary. Remove the brim (if you used one) and maybe hit those edges with a bit of sandpaper. In my case there was some slight stringing, but that was removed easily enough as well. Other than that the razor grips should be ready-to-use fresh off the printer.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCZ/I76P/JNOVIQB6/FCZI76PJNOVIQB6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1A/9EJL/JNOVJH3U/F1A9EJLJNOVJH3U.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Prototyping, Printing & Finishing"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "As it is easier to demonstrate than describe the blade insertion and extraction I have added a video to clearly show you how it works. If you prefer it in writing, essentially you use the flat side of the razor to push the small portrusion at the top to the side at which point you can insert the razor blade into the grip. Be careful when inserting it as the razor is of course very sharp, so mind your fingers.\nOnce the razor is fully inserted the locking tab should spring back into place and lock the razor in. For removal, push the locking tab to the side while gently pressing on the bottom side part of the razor to push part of it out of the grip, at which point you can grab the razor and fully extract it.\nFor demonstration purposes I have cut a couple of different materials which I have lying around. Of course the sharp blade itself is the most important factor, but I wanted to show that with the grip you can really push down on it without hurting your fingers and without the grip taking any damage. Here's my test materials:\n0.4mm construction paper\nNo challenge at all, it's thin and not that hard after all\n5mm foamboard\nAgain, no problems as the foam is soft\n1mm gasket rubber\nA bit thicker, but still fairly soft.

They hold the razor blades well, allow one to apply quite a bit of pressure while cutting and don't dig into your fingers such as standalone blades do. The knurling helps improve the grip without feeling particularly pointy, and the finger rest gives a comfortable place to apply extra pressure (although Lie didn't like that - personal preference I guess). They should serve me well when leatherworking and during a host of different cutting-related activities.\nI do think I could play around a bit more with different thicknesses and I might improve the ergonomics even more, maybe by making the whole grip more triangular in shape.Perhaps instead of knurling divets for fingers might be even better and feel more natural.\nA negative point is that as the grip is still fairly small overall ones hand may cramp up because it might be a bit difficult / awkward to hold. However, I think this is in the nature of such a compact grip and standalone blades are no larger to begin with, so it's an inherent property. If more ergonomics are necessary it might be better to go with a route similar to a straight razor-like grip, or go more into the direction of a utility knife.\nThe grip also covers quite a bit of the blade itself, thus reducing the effective maximum cut depth which can be achieved with the razor blades. With a somewhat stronger material such as ABS or perhaps Nylon it might be possible to reduce this, but some loss in cutting depth will be essentially unavoidable with this design. After all the blade needs to be held securely and not flop around in the grip or have the grip break when applying a bit too much pressure.\nAlso do note that there are a couple of different versions of those single edge safety razor blades. Mostly they differ in the blade thickness. There's some extra thin ones, the regular ones and some heavier-duty ones. I think all should fit, but if you encounter any problems at all, please do tell me.\nSTL Files:\nNow as promised, here are the STL files of all the different single edge safety razor grips I have designed so far. You can download them here, or head over to my recently registered thingiverse account, where you'll find them under the following link:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3173412\nThat's just if you prefer to download things on thingiverse rather than instructables, for whatever reason.\nPersonally I'd recommend the medium knurled grip with a finger rest. I think it offers the best grip, ergonomics and allows to apply a decent amount of cutting pressure without putting too much strain on your finger.\nIn any case, have fun using them and as always I welcome any kind of criticism, remarks or ideas for improvements and such. If you think you have a nifty design change proposal, do tell me and I'll see if I can put it into practice.

These are also available from DIY stores and can often be purchased in different widths and lengths which is just what we were looking for. We cut some of our lengths into shorter sections making sure that they were all different as we wanted a random staggered pattern to create more interest to the table. You could have different plank depths although this will require more resin.\nYou could use pallet wood or wood with more interesting edges but we wanted to make a table with clean lines and a modern feel so opted for the planed planks.\nThe most important thing about the wood when you are preparing is to make sure that the planks are smooth, flat and dry before you begin. So, depending what sort of wood you use, you may need to put more work into the preparation of the planks.\nNext you need to lay out all of the planks in a random pattern leaving your choice of gaps for the resin and a border - for the table in the project we used an:\n8mm gap between the planks and a 12mm border around the outside of the planks.\nYou can then work out the total table area. Remember if you have bigger gaps between the planks you will require more resin per square metre of table.\nWe also wanted to create contrast between the planks and we achieved this by lightening and darkening some of the planks, use masking tape to mark up which ones to change. To lighten some we brushed on white (water based) wood dye and in some cases applied two coats to give a lighter shade.We then darkened a selection of the other planks using a blowtorch by passing the flame over the plank which brought out the natural grain in the wood.\nOnce you have prepared the planks lay them back out to make sure you are happy with the variation in the colour and layout before you begin - it's a good idea to draw a plan of where your planks go in the layout so you can lay them back in the resin with ease.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FE8/C9WB/JMGL10XK/FE8C9WBJMGL10XK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK3/KXII/JMGL11UV/FK3KXIIJMGL11UV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUD/3NEH/JMGL11KY/FUD3NEHJMGL11KY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIX/Q3VO/JMGL11S2/FIXQ3VOJMGL11S2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG5/SVEI/JNULHKMH/FG5SVEIJNULHKMH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBO/8OON/JMGL10XA/FBO8OONJMGL10XA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Step 2: the Wood"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Our baseboard is a piece of polypropylene sheet.

Once all the sides are stuck firmly in place use the tape to seal the corners - it is very important that the base and barriers are completely water proof and will not allow any resin to leak out.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYX/KDBG/JMGL1130/FYXKDBGJMGL1130.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKB/4NV8/JMGL11EG/FKB4NV8JMGL11EG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7D/6UNZ/JMGL11OG/F7D6UNZJMGL11OG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBN/AT82/JMGL11OD/FBNAT82JMGL11OD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAJ/Y8XU/JMGL11PB/FAJY8XUJMGL11PB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1W/U506/JMGL118K/F1WU506JMGL118K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6B/TD0K/JMGL119S/F6BTD0KJMGL119S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOW/CDHD/JMGL11OJ/FOWCDHDJMGL11OJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FON/1MGO/JNULHKMF/FON1MGOJNULHKMF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYY/OTHS/JMGL119P/FYYOTHSJMGL119P.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Step 3: the Baseboard and Barriers"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Now that the barriers and baseboard are set up it is time to prepare the resin for the project.\nWorking out how much resin and hardener you'll need for a resin plank table is a little bit complicated because you need to allow for the resin underneath, in the gaps and on top. So if you're going to be creating a table around the same as the table in the project you should allow for around 10kg resin per square metre of table.\nThis table is 1.28sqm so in total we're using just under 13kg of resin in total.\nWe calculated how much resin and hardener we needed, the GlassCast\u00ae 3 has a mix ratio of 2 parts resin to 1 part hardener by weight and it's easier to pigment the resin required for the whole project in one go to ensure consistency in the colour throughout the project. Pour out the required amount of resin into a clean bucket.\nFollowing some experimentation prior to the project we worked out that around 3.5g pigment per kilogram of resin gives this bright but still translucent effect that we wanted. For a project this size we used just over 45g pigment in 13kg Resin.\nREMEMBER at this stage you are only pigmenting the resin (not the hardener).\nThorough mixing is essential to make sure the pigment is dispersed through the resin. Make sure you scrape the sides and bottom of the bucket and mix until a consistent colour can be seen through all of the resin.\nThe Pours\nTo encapsulate the planks properly and prevent any air bubbles we need to break down the resin pours into 4 stages - it's really important to follow these instructions to get the best results in the finished table.\nHere's how we broke the process down:\nPour a 3mm base layer and allow it to partially cure\nPour a thin sealing layer - to sit the planks in and seal all open wood and allow it to partially cure\nPour a fill layer - to bring the resin up to the top of the planks and allow it to partially cure\nPour a 3mm surface layer and allow to fully cure", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Q/BAOJ/JMGL11AX/F1QBAOJJMGL11AX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F49/WWVZ/JMGL11H7/F49WWVZJMGL11H7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSW/PRQW/JMGL11J4/FSWPRQWJMGL11J4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB8/MN5D/JMGL11LU/FB8MN5DJMGL11LU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL9/0AJ3/JMGL11I8/FL90AJ3JMGL11I8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Step 4: the Resin"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "IMPORTANT for each of the pours the pigmented resin will need to be mixed with the correct amount of hardener. The calculation will be included in each step - although your calculation will be specific to your project.\nAccurate measuring and mixing is essential, any unmixed resin will not cure properly and will leave soft tacky areas in the project. Use digital scales to make sure you are as accurate as possible.\nDouble Potting\nWeigh out the correct amount of resin and hardener into a bucket and mix thoroughly using a mixing stick for approximately 3 minutes.

You can use a heat gun to disperse any air bubbles if required although GlassCast is very good at self degassing. Then allow this stage to cure to the B-stage.\nThe B-stage\nThe B-stage means that the resin has started to become firm but still has a tackiness.\nTo tell if this stage has been reached - with a gloved finger, touch the resin and if it leaves a mark but does not stick to the glove it has reached it's B-stage and you need to prepare part 1 of the pour.\nIf you allow the resin to cure past the B-stage then the resin will not chemically bond to the next layer so will need to be keyed all over with abrasive paper to create a bond with the new layer - you will need to allow the resin to reach the B-stage after pours 1,2 and 3.\nIn an ambient room temperature of around 20\u00b0C the B-stage will be reached in approximately 12 hours (using GlassCast 3) keep checking with a gloved finger to ensure you pour the next layer at the correct time.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSL/ZC2J/JN3HW95C/FSLZC2JJN3HW95C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3B/EXBY/JMGL10U3/F3BEXBYJMGL10U3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU2/E3T3/JMGL111V/FU2E3T3JMGL111V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEN/GWGA/JMGL110Q/FENGWGAJMGL110Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHA/2EOD/JMGL11OO/FHA2EODJMGL11OO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9B/8EKV/JMGL11K1/F9B8EKVJMGL11K1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMG/LCFD/JMGL11DJ/FMGLCFDJMGL11DJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF5/6551/JMGL10W5/FF56551JMGL10W5.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Step 5: Pour 1 - the Base Layer"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Repeat the weighing and mixing process for the 2nd layer - 1.5mm will be sufficient.\nPour the mixture onto the part cured 1st layer and spread out\nThen using a brush, paint the resin on the underside of the planks before lowering them on to the base\nGently tilt the planks whilst lowering to prevent air pockets being trapped underneath them until all planks are in the correct position\nThen paint the resin on to all exposed surfaces of the planks to seal them\nThen use tile spacers to consistently create the 8mm gaps all around the planks - it's really important to do this so the planks don't float around\nFor the border around the outside use larger tile spacers or something similar to prevent movement\nNow leave the 2nd pour for a few hours until the resin has begun to gel, then remove the spacers and packers.

I had some volunteer students from study hall stop by and paint all the cardboard sheets for me before we started the project.\nMake an example sign that can be shown to your students.\nProject Purpose:\nI use this project to introduce how to run our laser cutter and as a way to assess students on their knowledge of the content we have been covering. This year I used it in my manufacturing class right after we had covered the six manufacturing processes. The manufacturing processes are what I will have my students make their signs and give their presentations about. I like this project quite a bit and think next year I plan to use it in several of my classes for different pieces of content , like when we cover the different fields of engineering or simple machines.\nProject Hook:\nI introduce this project by showing my students interesting business signs. I try to focus on finding signs that are very well designed and represent what the business does in some fashion. Examples: a coffee shop that has the outline of a coffee bean or a mug, a dentist office sign in the shape of a tooth, or a surfing shop with a wave and surfer popping out of the sign, etc. My goal is to give the students examples of what a quality sign looks like, show them what types of signs are possible, get them excited about what about the upcoming project, and to get their creativity juices percolating\nClass Discussion/Outline:\nIntroduce project with sign examples. Great time to show your example sign.\nGive students Business Sign Project handout\nOverview the entire project, discuss the expectations, and student submittals\nDiscuss project deadlines.\nStudent work time.\nAssessment:\nStudents will be assessed on the design and construction of their sign as well as on their presentation. A rubric will be used.\nAttachments and Project Notes.\nI have provided my Business Sign Project Handout as well as the Business Sign Project Rubric I use to grade the students on this project. The rubric is a Frankenstein rubric that I cobbled together from other rubrics I created or found for free online over the years, it is very basic. Feel free to use them as is or edit them to work for your class.\nI can complete this project in about two weeks in my classes. That is with my students meeting every other day and getting roughly 55-60 minutes of work time per class.

I always try to give my students some weird/fun/maybe slightly stupid name examples, like Johnny Cool's Crazy Treacherous Sawmill or Lackadaisical Forming Operations. Mostly, I just try to get them thinking and using terms they've learned throughout school, not just terms from my class.\nI only give my students about fifteen or twenty minutes to come up with their business ideas. If I don't give my students a quick deadline half of them will spend all of their time trying to come up with the perfect name or they will simply give up and say they cant think of anything. When they have to come up with and idea in a very short time the students tend to do better with getting something down on paper so they can start brainstorming designs for their actual sign. If they come up with a better name when they are actually brainstorming design ideas for their sign I will usually let them change it.\nOnce they have their business idea and name I make them sketch out three different design ideas. I don't have them worry about scale and size at this point, just what the sign would look like. The main requirements are that the sign needs to represent their chosen topic in some way and the name of their company needs to be displayed on the sign somewhere. Once they have three designs, we talk them over, choose one, and move on to the next step.\nMy students always complain that I make them come up with three ideas. I always stress the point that when they think they can't come up with one more idea, that is when the weird/cool/crazy/fun ideas come from. They also always think that their first idea is by far the best so some students will try to make one really cool, detailed first sketch and then two sketches that look like my two year old niece drew them. If that happens I make them go back to the drawing board and put a little more effort into their other two designs. As long as their designs are school appropriate and I see they put some thought into each design I usually let them choose whichever option they want.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F87/XB1N/JNSR7SMA/F87XB1NJNSR7SMA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Idea Sketches"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "With their business idea and sign design approved, the students now must create their design in CAD software. By this point in the class my students know how to use at least one CAD software, which they can use to design their sign. Most of my students have modeled much more difficult objects than their sign already so this portion of the project usually is not too difficult and does not take incredibly long. (Which is one reason I like using it to introduce the laser cutter as my previous laser cutter projects were much more CAD heavy.) The one thing students will want to consider is the layers to their sign. Depending on the look they are going for and what they want to emphasize, some students may only have two layers, some three, and occasionally I'll let students go to four layers if it makes sense for the design of their sign. Once a student or two has finished the CAD work for their sign I walk the entire class through how to export their design to the correct file format that we can use with our laser cutter.\nI've included the DXF file for the simple casting sign I created for my class.

The next step is to cut their parts out of cardboard. I have my students work in groups of two at the laser cutter. Each student's entire design needs to take less than ten minutes to cut out. You can give your students whatever time length with the laser cutter you prefer. My school runs on a four block schedule, where each block is 90 minutes long. With the ten minute criteria, I can usually have five, maybe six students, finish their laser cutting in one period.\nIf the students parts take a few minutes less than ten minutes to run on the laser, I have them engrave their entire sign onto the backing/major portion of their sign. This will help them glue up their parts in the proper layout in the next step.\nI teach my students as an entire class how to run our laser cutter at once. During that demonstration I give them a handout that is a step by step procedure they can use when it is their turn. I upload a tutorial video on how to run our laser cutter to our class website that they can use as well. I found that using this overall process of a live demonstration, a step by step handout, and a tutorial video seems to work pretty well to teach the students how to safely and properly use our machine. The only other major thing I do besides answer a question here or there is to check the students work before they actually run the laser.\nThe most common problem that arises when students are using our laser with cardboard, is the cardboard catching on fire. I discuss this problem with the students and show them tips to help reduce the chance of that happening with their parts. Tips I share are generally not having their pieces positioned too close to the edge of the cardboard and checking that the settings are correct for the machine to cut cardboard. In addition to those tips I have my students keep some damp rags close by when they are running their parts to help put out any flames if things do catch on fire.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1A/3CYO/JNSR7TL2/F1A3CYOJNSR7TL2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUI/W96Z/JNSR7TN4/FUIW96ZJNSR7TN4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8W/T9YA/JNSR7SBN/F8WT9YAJNSR7SBN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZU/3H55/JNSR7SCN/FZU3H55JNSR7SCN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Laser Parts"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "The students now need to take their laser cut parts and assemble them into their sign.

Another option instead of installing a plug is a vulcanized tire patch which requires the tires to be unmounted from the wheel, that patch is applied to the inside of the tire. A vulcanized patch is the best repair for a punctured tire, however it does require more work, specialty equipment such as a tire machine, and can be slightly more costly.\nTools/Supplies Needed:\nreamer\nplug insertion tool\ntire plug\npliers\nspray bottle with soap and water mixture\nair compressor\nside cutters", "title": "How to Repair a Tire Leak Using a Plug - Everything You Need to Know", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Repair-a-Tire-Leak-Using-a-Plug-Everything-/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "While we can easily see the leak, if you are having trouble finding yours, using a spray bottle with a soap and water mix, ensure the tire is up to pressure and spray the tire.

If a tire is too far worn, taking reference from the wear bars, than a plug cannot be used as well.\nFirst removing the object which punctured the tire if it\u2019s still there, this can be anything from a piece of plastic, glass, metal, screw, nail, bolt, I have seen wrenches cause punctures before, or in my case an s hook. Removal processes of the object varies depending on what it is. You may need a screwdriver to dig the object out, needle nose pliers, something to help unscrew the object, etc.\nYou can purchase these plugs in a kit which comes with all the tools required to install the plugs.

I got some conduit clamps and parts to cap the ends of the bare metal conduit. For the 3/4 inch wire connector plug, I clipped off part of the plastic plug so it would fit compressed in the EMT conduit. It's really meant to fit a real 3/4 inch opening in an electrical box. The 1/2 inch plastic bushing fit over the 1/2 inch conduit. I tapped it on with a rubber mallet.\nI made some wood bases that would act as cross adapters for the top crossbar piece.

I got out my conduit bender and a piece of 1/2 conduit (I do not have the bigger 3/4 EMT bender).

I did end up using all of it to make the webbed seat back.\nThe first thing I did was to hem all around the piece of material for the seat. It would be suspended between the front and back rods. I cut X slits at the points where the seat bars were mounted into the supports. Pull back the fabric and sew all around to reinforce the opening.\nYou can then seam that side forming a channel to pass the seat tube through. Do for front of the seat and back.\nWith the seat fabric pulled on to the front and back seat tube it looks like a camp cot or medic's carry litter. Hmmm, maybe I should have started out by modding one. Since the fabric was longer front to back, I was able to pinch the excess material and sew it so it formed a portion of the seat back. Mark it out in tailor's chalk which I did not do. I had to take apart a seam that drifted while sewing by eye. Test fit to make sure it will go on the seat bars.\nI then cut a bunch of straps long enough to reach from the seat back to the top crossbar. Make sure to add enough length to use the buckle. 7 vertical straps looked about right to be the webbing back grid. I then had enough webbing on the roll to cut 4 cross straps. Sew the vertical straps spaced evenly on the seatback piece. You can then lay out the rest of the grid.\nSince marking with tailor's chalk doesn't work to well on slick webbing, I just stapled where the straps crossed in the layout. You can then sew the horizontal straps to complete the webbing gridwork. Use two staples for it to hold as you wrangle the spaghetti mess in the sewing machine. Tack down the connection down with a seam, pull out the staples and sew a box with an X pattern in the middle.\nThe free ends of the cut polyester/nylon webbing needed to be sealed so that they do not unravel. I roasted the ends gently in the flame on my gas stove. Do this only if you are a professional...and it's your stove. And let the napalmy melted ends cool before touching. Don't let the hot ends contact anything else while it cools.\nYou can then put on the tri-glide buckles forming a loop at the top of each strap to attach to the crossbar.

Compared to buying box-store lumber you can make something in a different league. OK well, 'different' - I'm not dissing the whole 2x4 this or that - standardised wood's really cool for some projects and circumstances (and actually kinda hard to achieve from DIY milled wood). So we want to play to the strengths of being there at the beginning - when the lumber is first made. It does pose some unique considerations which I'll get to as we go, but for the rest of this step lets look at keeping happy and healthy, and what tools we need:\nSafety\nSafety is obviously important whenever you are using a chainsaw, and having already written a whole section on that in the instructable above, I will mention only a few points here:\n1. Keep the chain brake on all the times you are not actively cutting.\n2. Triple check the log is stable, cannot roll, and that the straight edge (in our case a ladder), is secure before you begin.\n3. Much of the risk with chainsaw milling occurs BEFORE and AFTER the actual sawing! Be mindful of how you transport heavy slabs once cut, and how you manoeuvre the log into position ready for milling.\n4. Don't ignore personal safety equipment! For milling on days without a stiff breeze, a duel vapour-dust mask as you see in the pics should be considered a requirement, not a nice-to-have.

To make furniture in the best possible way, you would want to have access to an industrial materials processing lab with extensive machinery and resources. Now as that isn't an option for many of us, I wanted to share the minimum requirements, as well as some intermediate resources that would make the process easier.\nBasic Tool Necessities:\nWhen buying your tools, you have many brands to sort through. Some great entry-level brands are Ryobi, Black and Decker, Porter Cable, and Skill. Some higher quality and more durable brands are Dewalt, Bosch, Milwaukee, and Festool. Choose your tools based on you budget, and the demand (amount of times you need to use it).\nSafety Glasses\nTape Measure\nLevel\nCarpenter Square\nT-Square\nBasic Bar Clamps\nHand Drill\nDrill Bit Drivers\nDrill Bit Index\nSpade Bits\nCircular Saw\nJig Saw\nPalm Sander\nKreg Jig\n18 gauge Brad Nailer (and compressor)\nIntermediate Tools:\nThe following tools are not necessarily needed, but would make completing a large-scale project much easier.\nMiter Saw\nTable Saw\nScroll Saw\nRouter\nRouter Table\nRouter Bits\nDrill Press\nShop Vacuum\nLarge Bar/Pipe Clamps\nForsner Bits\nCountersinking bits\nPlug Cutters\nHole Saws\nProfessional Equipment:\nThese are tools that a professional may use to streamline the process even more.\nSurface Planer\nJointer\nPanel Saw\nBand Saw\nDado Jigs\nDovetail Jigs\nMaterials:\nSelecting your materials depends on your project, budget, and resources. If you do not have access to surface planers or jointers like me, then you are going to want to purchase wood that is pre-cut rather than rough finished. Buying select Pine boards from Home Depot will cost more than buying rough-cut hardwoods from a lumber superstore, but its more accessible to most and cuts a lot of the initial work out that needs some heavier machinery.\nI built this set of furniture out of an assortment of select pine from Home Depot, 1/2\" birch plywood, and some of Home Depot's pre-laminated pine project panels for the tops. This is not how a pro would do it, but it was the best option for me based on my resources, budget, time, and other constraints.\nIn addition to wood, you will need screws, nails, glue, stain, paint, and other things needed for assembly and finishing (discussed in later steps).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSN/JOTE/JNSR7NR3/FSNJOTEJNSR7NR3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB4/OUJ8/JNSR7NQ7/FB4OUJ8JNSR7NQ7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F72/LAER/JNSR7NN6/F72LAERJNSR7NN6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUT/FWC7/JNSR7NPU/FUTFWC7JNSR7NPU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Tools and Materials"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Once you have your plans, your tools, and your materials, its time to start to build! This is where the age-old saying \"measure twice, cut once\" comes to play. Follow your plans, but check your measurements as you work. I have made furniture two different ways, each with their own set of pros and cons:\nThe first is to make your cuts as you assemble. The pro is that it will be immediately apparent if something doesn't line up or fit and you can make adjustments as you go. The con is that this is a very slow process, and making adjustments as you work tends to take you away from your original plans which could be catastrophic.\nThe second is to make all your cuts, then assemble with minor tweaks and adjustments. The pro is that this is a more organized and quicker way to work. The con is that if something is off, you may discover that after you've run through all your materials. This method works very well if you have put a lot of time into your planning, which typically takes practice.\nAs you work, remember safety. All of the tools I listed in the previous step are dangerous and can cause serious harm or injury. Reading the manual isn't quite enough if its your first experience. Browse youtube and instructables for tutorials and make sure you feel comfortable using the tool while remaining aware of the danger.

Some wood joints employ fasteners, bindings, or adhesives, while others use only wood elements\"\nProfessionals create cuts and grooves that allow for wood to fit seamlessly together using nothing but some wood glue. Amateurs can rejoice to know that there are plenty of methods to fasten your boards together cleanly and with ease.\nA popular tool is the Kreg Jig, one that creates pocket holes to fasten wood together using concealed and hidden screws. The Kreg Jig is easier, efficient, and cheap but made even stronger when combined with wood glue. I used pocket holes to assemble panels, drawers, shelves, and even attach the tops on my furniture.\nAnother great tool is the 18 gauge brad nailer. This is phenomenal for attaching trim, especially when you plan to paint the furniture which will conceal the nail holes. The brad nailer should not be used for structural demands, but can be strengthen when combined with glue.\nPutting glue on two pieces of wood and clamping them together works as well, but can often be difficult to keep flat or aligned. I suggest you combine glue with the Kreg screws or brad nails for the best result.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FC4/JSWM/JNSR7O8W/FC4JSWMJNSR7O8W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE4/EV9R/JNSR7NMF/FE4EV9RJNSR7NMF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F91/4BQ9/JNSR7NOK/F914BQ9JNSR7NOK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWK/HU4C/JNSR7NOG/FWKHU4CJNSR7NOG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F60/SU3A/JNSR7NPR/F60SU3AJNSR7NPR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAL/ANLX/JNSR7NP6/FALANLXJNSR7NP6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Joinery and Assembly"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "A mentor of mine once told me that \"finishing is the easiest and fastest way to ruin a project\". He said this because people often feel as though the project is over and rush through it which can take beautiful craftsmanship and make it look like garbage. Now theoretically you can almost always sand down your finish to take the project back to wood, but you may lose detail or quality and definitely lose time.\nBefore finishing, test fit all of your parts, shelves, tops, and drawers before beginning the finishing process. Now is the time to make adjustments if needed. As you test fit, and before you start to paint or stain, sanding is an incredibly important step. Sanding wood removes imperfections and defects, as well as allows your finish to stick while keeping your project smooth. Some sanding must be done by hand but other parts can be done using an electric palm sander for consistency and to save time. You should start with a low grit (80 or 100) and work your way up to a higher grit (220 or 300) before applying your finish.\nChoosing whether to paint or stain your stain your project usually falls to personal preference, but there can be a few factors that may make your decision easier.\nIf it is a beautiful piece of wood, or an expensive hardwood, it would be a shame to paint over it. Consider a light oil or clear varnish instead.\nIf you are blending plywood with hardwoods or multiple types of wood, it may be difficult to apply an even and matching coat of stain across your project. Pre-stain conditioner can help alleviate this problem but it some cases painting may be a more professional finish\nIf your project has gaps, cracks, holes, or other imperfections you want to cover up, use caulk or spackle to fill and then paint your project instead of stain.\nProjects that are a combination of painted and stained is a timeless look and may be a good option if you combined budget saving manufacturing methods.\nNow when actually applying your finish (paint, stain, oil, varnish, or whatever it may be) there are many methods and sciences to follow. People far more skilled than me have documented these methods on the internet and I suggest you flip through. From what I can tell, there is never one way to do it and when I personally try to get fancy or follow a scientific procedure I always end up spending lots of money and making a mess of it. See my simple, trusted, and true methods that I use below which haven't let me down yet.\nDon't cut corners with the sanding, you will notice\nAlways apply finish in a well lit, ventilated, clean, dry, and warm environment\nNever shake your cans of finish, always stir gently\nAlways clean your projects with tac cloths before and in-between each coat of finish\nUse a light-weight spackle to fill cracks, apply with your finger and then lightly sand over once dry\nApply paint with a spray gun for the best finish, or use high-density rollers to mimic a spray gun\nApply stain with white cotton rags evenly, wear nitrile gloves\nUse polyurethane for clear coats and either apply using a spray gun or a nice (not cheap) brush, clean your brush thoroughly after each coat and throw away after each project\nUse purple scotchbrite pads to sand after each coat of polyurethane dries, then wipe with a tac cloth before applying the next coat\napply at least 5 coats of polyurethane every time\nWax paint using a cotton rag and finishing wax to smooth and protect\nWax finished wood using steel wool and finishing wax to smooth and protect", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5S/OBF3/JNSR7NMV/F5SOBF3JNSR7NMV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRJ/W36B/JNSR7NMS/FRJW36BJNSR7NMS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9E/NV5G/JNSR7NMG/F9ENV5GJNSR7NMG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDZ/O4GH/JNSR7PPN/FDZO4GHJNSR7PPN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F67/6X1C/JNSR7NXW/F676X1CJNSR7NXW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F87/UZEC/JNSR7NMC/F87UZECJNSR7NMC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Finishing"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "I hope that this instructable has answered some questions you may have had, or just gave you that extra bit of inspiration needed to start your next project.

Here I\u2019m using basswood which is a great starting point to learn kumiko. Its soft fibers and forgiving nature allow you to work it quite easily and hide those unforeseen mistakes.\nKumiko is an ancient Japanese woodworking tradition and this asanoha pattern is certainly the most popular. This instructable breaks down the four main parts of this pattern into small, digestible sections. The four parts that make up this pattern are the grid, diagonals, these pieces that make up these diamonds, and short diagonals.\nYou will need kumiko jigs to make this project:\nYou can buy a kumiko start kit here! It includes all the jigs and pieces you need to make this pattern. The only thing you need to provide is a chisel.\nYou can buy kumiko jigs here or find out how to make them here and watch a video on them here.\nTools that I used:\nThis can all be done with chisels and a handsaw.

Rough cut six pieces to just over 6\u201d long and trim them to exactly 6\u201d using your table saw and crosscut sled with a stop block.\nThe next thing to do is cut the half lap joints that will tie this grid together. Start by laying out where you need to cut the half laps. One will go directly in the center of these pieces and another on either side of the strips \u00bd\u201d in from the edge. Use a marking knife to get sharp lines and mark out the width of the half laps which are \u215b\u201d wide. We do this so we can line up those marks with the table saw blade and has it cut the joints since it too is \u215b\u201d. Adjust your stop block accordingly. Since we\u2019re using \u00bd\u201d wide strips, our blade needs to be sticking up \u00bc\u201d to cut halfway through the material.

But with a firm understanding and a bit of patience, you can get a nice, snug fit.\nStart with your 67.5 degree jig cutting a point on one end of each piece. This is the end that will fit in the corner of the diagonal pieces we just added and the grid. The opposite end of these pieces get a 22.5 degree cut. This is the area where patients is required to achieve the proper length. Dry fit two of these pieces in place and ideally there should not be a gap between the 22.5 degree bevels and corners.\nThere is still one more cut needed on these on these pieces and for that we need to move the stop block on our 22.5 degree jig, in just the smallest amount. Here we have to remove two thirds of the pointy end of the bevel we just created to create an asymmetrical point. This might take some trial and error so start taking off less material than needed and sneaking up on the fit.\nIf you haven\u2019t noticed by now that\u2019s the name of the game when it comes to kumiko.
