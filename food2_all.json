[{"category": "Food", "description": "Similar to coffee cake, Funny Cake is one of those foods that is quite sweet, not at all healthy, and hard to eat in moderation and yet is somehow an acceptable dish to serve for breakfast. At least I think it is. Originating in eastern Pennsylvania with the Amish and Mennonites, Funny Cake is a simple yet satisfying treat that combines two irrefutably good desserts: pie and cake.\nIn my mind, Funny Cake is funny for two reasons:\nIt is a cake baked baked inside of a pie crust.\nThere is chocolate frosting on the bottom of the cake.\nThere is another school of thought that offers an alternative comedic interpretation: the chocolate icing is applied to the top of the cake batter before baking and mysteriously works its way to the bottom before being removed from the oven. I do not endorse this method of cake frosting, nor am I amused by the mystery of frosting diffusing through cake batter. However, for the sake of experimentation, I have made two Funny Cakes for this Instructable: one that employs the proper method of applying the chocolate frosting before the cake batter and a second that was made with frosting on top of batter.\nNow, let's get started!", "title": "Pennsylvania Dutch Funny Cake", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Pennsylvania-Dutch-Funny-Cake/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Funny Cake (2 cakes)\n2 pie crusts (store-bought or homemade)\nCake\n1/2 cup shortening (Crisco preferable to butter)\n1 tsp. vanilla\n2 eggs\n2 cups flour\n2 tsp. baking powder\nChocolate bottom\n1 cup boiling water\n1 cup sugar\n1/2 cup cocoa\nHomemade Pie Crust (2 crusts)\n3 cups flour\n1 cup shortening (butter, Crisco, or a mix of both)\n2/3 cup ice water\n1 pinch salt\n2 pinches sugar\n1/2 tsp. baking powder\n1 egg (optional)\n1/2 tbs. apple cider vinegar (optional)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOA/O31W/J153XK4G/FOAO31WJ153XK4G.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Ingredients"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "If you'd prefer to use a store-bought crust you can go ahead an skip this step.\nBecause the focus of this Instructable is on the Funny Cake and not the crust, I'll only cover these details briefly.

I said in the parentheses after the title of the dish that this step was different for this dish. This starts after you fill the pot with water. Cut a finger of ginger off of the root and place it in the water. You may also add some green onions or leeks, and a half an onion here. This will give the broth more of a complex flavor. Mix all of the liquid ingredients and sugar into a bowl and stir the mixture with a fork. After the contents of the bowl are mostly liquid add it to the water. Let this heat into a boil. At this point you can add cilantro if you have it, but if you hate whole foods, you are done in with preparation. Set the noodles in the broth and take it off the heat.

Chop the celery making sure the white part connected to the roots isn\u2019t in the pile of celery that you\u2019re going to use. I like my onions small so what you need to do to replicate the recipe properly is to cut the sprout from the top of the onion, peel the first layer, and lay it on the cutting board cut side down. Slice down the middle, take the halves separately and slice vertically at multiple points on the side. Now cut horizontally, not cutting off any pieces this far. Now, chop the onions through making tiny squares of them. If you have bok choy you can just peel the bok choy to the core, and cut the leaves however you like.

That stuff is just the cat's pajamas.\" - Mahatma Gandhi\n\nTo elaborate on what I believe Gandhi was trying to say, real maple syrup is much better than the Aunt Jemima stuff we are all used to, which is actually corn syrup. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not a syrup snob, I grew up on the ol' Aunty J myself, and I loved it. But I am a hillbilly, so for some reason I have to make my own syrup.\n\nSome quick background information. Syrup can be made from many different species of trees. There are no \"ingredients\" to real syrup, it is literally just boiled down sap (spoiler alert, this Instructable is going to be boring). Maple trees have the highest sugar content in their sap so they are the easiest to make syrup, sugar maples being the best. It takes roughly 40 gallons of sugar maple sap to make one gallon of syrup. Silver maple sap/syrup ratio is roughly 50:1, and black walnut is roughly 60:1. I only have silver maple trees in my yard, so that's what I'm working with. Sap is collected in the spring when daytime temps are above freezing, and temps get below freezing at night. This freeze thaw cycle is what drives the sap through the tree. Once the trees bud (bad taste) or temps are constantly above freezing (poor production) you are done collecting sap.", "title": "How to Make Maple Syrup", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-Maple-Syrup-2/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "There are many different types of equipment for tapping trees, but the basic principle is that you are putting a spout in a tree and collecting the stuff that comes out. I got some taps (spiles) online and they have a short length of hose that can go directly into a bucket. Commercial operations just have a maple forest (sugar bush) full of hoses leading to the boiling place (sugar shack), no buckets to empty. Look at you learning all this top notch lingo, you're welcome.\nI drilled holes in the sides of 3 gallon buckets to collect the sap, I first drilled the lids but then realized rain or other gunk is more likely to get in the top so I taped over these holes and drilled the sides. Then I drilled a hole into the tree 1.5\" deep at a slight upward angle, which is 3.8 cm to anyone not using our ridiculous measurement system. Then I tapped the spile into the tree until it bottoms out in the hole and ran the hose into the side of a bucket.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5C/JY9R/J0IEKS9J/F5CJY9RJ0IEKS9J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBR/0Y3R/J0IEKS5F/FBR0Y3RJ0IEKS5F.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Tapping the Trees"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Once you have all your spiles installed you are all set to collect sap. The amount of sap you get from trees varies based on quite a few variables that I haven't quite pinned down yet, but my best tree spit out about 3 gallons on it's best days. The one comment that everyone has is \"Why is the sap clear? It doesn't look like syrup\". To which I reply \"That's because it's 98% water, gah, read a book\". It is clear, it does look just like water, and you can drink it just like this and it tastes like a very lightly sweetened water.\nI had originally planned to collect all my sap into two large barrels that I bought, that way I could do just one boiling session since that is time consuming. I later realized that since the sap has sugars it can grow bacteria, so it either needed to be boiled or frozen within a few days of collection. I chose to freeze the sap because I don't have the time to boil every week, I would prefer to do it all at once. I know what you're wondering, can my wife fit inside the barrel?

This can be as simple as a big pot on a propane turkey fryer if you don't have much. You will want to do the cooking outside because you will be boiling off gallons of water, which could spell bad news for the inside of your house. The more surface area you have in your boiling pan the faster it will evaporate the excess water, so I chose to make a fairly large pan. My friend Mikey B and I went and got a 3'x5' sheet of 1/8\" carbon steel. I had to wash this off really well to get the oil from manufacturing off, then rub it down with vegetable oil to keep it from rusting. If I decide to do this for years to come I will probably end up getting a sheet of stainless steel and making this again.\nI don't have a big fancy bending brake to make the pan, so we had to get a little creative. The steel was much too thick to bend as-is by any sort of hand bending method, so we decided to score the bending lines with a circ saw to make it a bit easier. I wish I had pictures of this part because it was probably the most interesting, but we were too busy swearing and yelling at each other we forgot to stop and take pictures. I hate that guy. Basically I set the depth of the blade to half the thickness of the steel, then slowly cut along the lines, and eventually cut out the corners. We tried an angle grinder first, but that was taking way too long for a couple old impatient dudes. If you ever do this make sure you have a carbide tipped blade, and you never heard of this technique from me. I have included a picture with comments to help clarify what I'm talking about. Once all the lines were scored and the corners were cut out we were able to bend the sides (with help from a 3 lb hammer) and weld the four corners so that it doesn't leak.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F86/ZENQ/J0X59PLM/F86ZENQJ0X59PLM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Making the Boiling Pan"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "If you're as cheap as me you're not going to use propane to boil your sap, so you're going to need to make some sort of wood fire cooking apparatus.

If you're wondering how long it takes to melt 50 gallons of ice, the answer is longer than two days. So we still had quite a bit of ice when we started our boiling, but it wasn't too big of a deal. This part of the process is time consuming and there's really not much to it, add some sap when it gets a little low in the pan, and add some wood when the fire gets low. So you can take care of other chores while the sap is boiling. Or you can do what we did, which was battle rap and have vigorous debates about advanced Indian leg wrestling technique.\nAfter about 8 hours we had the bulk of the sap boiled down to about 2 gallons, so we transferred the sap from the big boiling pan to a stock pot on a propane turkey fryer. We filtered the sap with cheesecloth when we transfered to the stock pot but I don't think this worked very well, more on this later. The stock pot will just give us a lot more control to get the sap to the point where we need it. We brought the sap to a boil on the turkey fryer. When the water boils out the sap temperature will start to rise. Seven degrees above boiling is the temperature when you can officially call this syrup. We had already done a test with the stock pot to find that with our elevation and our thermometer water boiled at 210, so we needed to get the sap/syrup up to 217 degrees.

The sugar sand isn't harmful at all, but it's just not desirable.\nThe final crucial step in making your own syrup is to go to the store and just buy it. For realsies though, our syrup ended up with a very unique taste unlike any syrup I have had before. It is very very sweet, and I think it tastes like cotton candy. If I were to be honest it's not my favorite flavor of syrup, but my wife says she likes it better than other syrups, so it's just a matter of taste.

Without having more experience doing this, and without doing any more research yet, I can't really explain why we ended up with the unique flavor that we did. What I can comment on is what worked and what didn't in the process.\nThe concrete block stove worked great, it got very hot, the chimney worked perfectly and had great air flow, it burned so hot and clean there was no visible smoke. The pan worked well, if I were to do this again I would probably weld a spigot and valve off the side to make draining from the pan easier.\nOne thing that apparently didn't work too well is our filtering of the sugar sand. We used cheesecloth and a coffee filter, and somehow it was still in the syrup. Perhaps we should have let it cool down a smidge and settle/seperate before we filtered, there is more research and experimenting to be done on this. Another thing that didn't work well, but actually could have, is a drip system from the barrel to the boiling pan. This would allow us to keep a slow steady drip of sap into the boiling pan so we wouldn't kill the boil by adding a ton of cold sap at once. We had this set up but discovered there was a small leak in the valve, and since we were going to be standing around and drawing fake tattoos on each other all day we decided it would be much easier to just pour it into the pan by hand. If I were to have a much larger operation I think you could recoup a lot of the heat lost through the chimney by running a copper drip line coil through the chimney to preheat the sap before it enters the pan.\nI could have gone into a lot more detail about certain elements of this project, but this is the abridged version. There are a lot of good resources online that know a lot more than I do.

It is imperative that you get instant pudding. I recommend the Jello brand instant pudding as this requires no cooking nor setting time and allows you to cut down on prep time and enjoy your finished product sooner.\nTo make to pudding you will need to empty the envelope of powdered mix into your mixing dish and then pour 2 cups of cold milk on top. After doing so, whisk strongly for two minutes, or until your mixture drips off of the mixing utensil as opposed to running off. If your mixture combines to be too thick, add a dash more milk and whisk to combine again. This may be repeated until desired thickness is achieved.

Be patient and try to achieve a smooth, consistent layer of pudding across the crust to ensure even layering of the final product.\nNext, add a third layer of graham crackers; these should be gently pressed into the vanilla pudding to discourage movement when spreading the next flavor of pudding.\nAtop the crackers, pour out the second pudding flavor -in this case, chocolate- and spread across the crackers.

There is traditionally no particular cooking method for the ratatouille. Famous French chefs like Roger Verg\u00e9 or Gui Gedda recommend lightly frying each vegetable separately to give them a crispy and toasty flavor.\nIn the Pixar film, Ratatouille, right at the climax, the little chef, Remy the rat, prepared the celebrated version of this simple dish to impress the food critic, Anton Ego. The dish in reality was a version of another similar dish called the confit byaldi developed by French chef Michel Gu\u00e9rard (founder of nouvelle cuisine) in 1976. For the film it was realized by American chef Thomas Keller who was the food consultant for the film. However Keller\u2019s version (or Guerard\u2019s confit byaldi) would miss out on the main idea of ratatouille, its crispness and the fact that each vegetable retain their own particular flavor.\nNow let me come to my innovation. To retain the taste of the original ratatouille, we must fry the vegetables separately. However to impress Anton Ego and the viewers, it is better to finely chop the vegetables and arrange them in a pattern on a baking tray. So why not combine both the approaches, the French and the American.\nDetails : http://www.theparisfeast.com/2017/03/ratatouilles-...", "title": "Ratatouille's Traditional French Ratatouille : Original Innovative Recipe", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Ratatouilles-Traditional-French-Ratatouille-Origin/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Zucchini : 2\nEgg Plants: 1\nBell Peppers : 2\nGarlic : 6 cloves\nOnion (yellow): 1\nTomatoes : 6\nTomato Puree: 250 grams\nDried Herbes de Provence: 3 teaspoons\nExtra Virgin Olive Oil: 9 tablespoon\nFresh Thyme: 15 strands\nFresh Bay Leaves: 10\nSalt: to taste\nFreshly Ground Pepper: 1 teaspoon\nDetails : http://www.theparisfeast.com/2017/03/ratatouilles-...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8T/9TT5/J0MOVLAN/F8T9TT5J0MOVLAN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGZ/F53D/J0MOVLAO/FGZF53DJ0MOVLAO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAU/Z2FC/J0MOVKMW/FAUZ2FCJ0MOVKMW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Ingredients"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Details : http://www.theparisfeast.com/2017/03/ratatouilles-...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F81/8BXR/J0MOVKEF/F818BXRJ0MOVKEF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Chop the Eggplant and Zucchini in Thin Slices As Shown in the Picture."}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Details : http://www.theparisfeast.com/2017/03/ratatouilles...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6U/YIEW/J0MOVKEG/F6UYIEWJ0MOVKEG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Take a Flat Non-stick Pan and Shallow Fry the Eggplant for 1 Minute at Medium Heat."}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Details : http://www.theparisfeast.com/2017/03/ratatouilles...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5F/N98R/J0MOVKEI/F5FN98RJ0MOVKEI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Change the Side and Keep for Another Minute."}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Details : http://www.theparisfeast.com/2017/03/ratatouilles...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOH/4FO4/J0MOVKEP/FOH4FO4J0MOVKEP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Remove Them From the Heat and Keep Aside.

They are named Grandpa Fudge Cookies, because they have been made for decades for my Grandpa, who loves them above all else and has become his special treat. Over 40 years ago, my grandfather worked in construction as an electrician. My grandmother would bake him a batch of cookies every week, and every day for more than 20 years, he would bring several cookies with him to work, to enjoy with his lunch. They used to be called Alligator cookies, because of their resemblance to alligator skin, but when my mom started making them for my grandpa when she was young, she started calling them \u201cdaddy cookies\u201d. When Me and my brother were born, they turned into Grandpa cookies, and that is how they remain. I have grown to love them as well, hoping to see the little brown fudge cookies on the counter after every big meal.\nToday I am going to pass the recipe to you, as my Mom has passed it to me, as her Mom has passed it to her, as her Mom passed it to her so long ago.

Because we're offering two different methods of forming your tortillas (either with a tortilla press or a rolling pin) it's essential that you read through the entire recipe before you begin.\n\nYield: 12-19 tortillas (depending on the size of each tortilla)\n\nMaterials:\n2 c Maseca* (can be found at most local Walmarts or at least your local Latino market)\n1 \u00bd c warm water\n1 tsp Kosher Salt\n\nTools:\n1 tortilla press (If you don\u2019t have a tortilla press, you can use a rolling pin.)\n1 gallon Ziploc bag (Cut along the seams to open the bag into one flat piece of plastic.)\n1 large, flat pan OR electric griddle\n1 large bowl (for the tortilla masa*)\n1 or 2 clean linen cloths (to wrap the tortillas and preserve their warmth)\n\nDirections:\nMixing the masa*:\n1. Pour your Maseca into a large, clean bowl so that it makes a little mountain. Sprinkle the salt over the mountain.\n2. Form a small crater in the top of the mountain (think volcano) and pour the warm water into the crater, and let it flow over the maseca. Mix and knead the mixture with your hand until it is one smooth ball. Add small amounts of Maseca or water as needed until the masa\u2019s texture is neither crumbly nor sticky.\n\nForming and cooking the tortillas:\n1. Decide whether you will use a tortilla press or a rolling pin. For each, you will need a Ziplock bag with the slide-lock cut off and the side seams sliced open. The tortilla press helps maintain consistency in tortilla thickness, is easier to use, and make rounder tortillas. If a rolling pin is more readily available to you, this will also work, but you will need to be careful to maintain a consistent thickness as you roll it out into a circle.\n(In either case, make sure you experiment with the thickness of the tortilla; the thinner it is, the faster it will cook. If it\u2019s too thick, then they will probably be undercooked on the inside. This won\u2019t hurt you, but it\u2019s a matter of taste. Don\u2019t be afraid to experiment with the first few; you\u2019ll have enough dough to practice a couple of times.)\n2. Form all your balls of masa in order to count how many tortillas you can make and how many you might practice with. Pinch enough masa to roll into a smooth ball about an inch to an inch and a half in diameter. Repeat until you have no more masa.\n3. Form your tortillas in your preferred method. (See two suggested methods below, labeled Tortilla Press Method and Rolling Pin Method.)\n4. Heat your large, flat, dry skillet or electric griddle to medium high heat or 350 degrees. After you are satisfied with the thickness and size of your tortilla, open the ziplock bag, hold the tortilla on your dominant hand\u2019s palm, and gently pull away the plastic from the tortilla. Place the tortilla on the hot pan or griddle.\n5. Let each side cook according to personal taste (some like it golden brown, while others prefer it lighter or darker). Once cooked, place the tortilla on a plate and cover it with a linen cloth or clean dishrag. Stack consecutive tortillas on top of each other. Keep cloth covering the tortillas to maintain warmth.\n\nTortilla Press Method:\n\n1. Take one masa ball and press it gently between your hands to make two flat sides and a rounded edge (about \u00bd\u201d-1\u201d thick, like a coin). Fill in the larger cracks that appear. Open your tortilla press and place the open ziplock bag on top of it\n2. Fold the ziplock bag over the masa.\n3. Gently place the top of the tortilla press on top, pull the handle down, and press with both hands to flatten the masa.\n4. Open the press, flip over the ziplock bag with the masa pressed inside, and press again just as you did before to make the tortilla an even thickness.\n\nRolling Pin Method:\n\n1. Open your ziplock bag on your cutting board or flat, smooth surface. Take one masa ball and press it gently between your hands to make two flat sides and a rounded edge (about \u00bd-1\u201d thick, like a coin). Fill in the larger cracks that appear, and place on the open ziplock bag. Fold the ziplock bag over the masa.\n2. Press down on the dough with your palm so that it will be flat enough to roll out. Then roll out the dough with your rolling pin into an even thickness in the shape of a circle.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FC7/UQ2Q/J0MOOV44/FC7UQ2QJ0MOOV44.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMD/HN6S/J0MOOV3A/FMDHN6SJ0MOOV3A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8J/K39X/J0MOOV2R/F8JK39XJ0MOOV2R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPA/7OZS/J0MOOUUP/FPA7OZSJ0MOOUUP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDZ/1X5L/J0MOOV2N/FDZ1X5LJ0MOOV2N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPH/6SGO/J0MOOV2Y/FPH6SGOJ0MOOV2Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUC/FMCJ/J0MOOV2V/FUCFMCJJ0MOOV2V.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Homemade Tortillas (2 Methods Included)"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Materials:\n1 whole pineapple\n\u00bc-\u00bd c sugar\n2 quarts water\n\nTools:\nBlender\nStrainer\nPitcher\nMixing Spoon\nKitchen Knife\nCutting Board\n\nDirections:\n1.

The following are two options for people living in the Provo/Orem, Utah area:\nHarmons in Orem: $6/sheet (8 \u00bd\" x 11\"); bring in a colored printout of the images you want to print, and they will make a copy onto the edible paper.\nMaceys in Orem (The edible ink printer at the Provo Maceys was broken when we called. But the Orem one works great!): $7/sheet (8 \u00bd\" x 11\"); bring in a colored printout of the images you want to print, and they will make a copy onto the edible paper.\nKeep in mind:\nThe edible-ink paper should be given to you in a plastic wrapping. Keep the paper in the wrapping until you\u2019re ready to use it (or else the paper will dry out and become brittle).\nEdible paper doesn\u2019t last more than two or three weeks before getting dry and brittle.

Immediately pour the egg whites in the center and allow it to cook through. While that's going, dice the garlic and chop the onions. Heat up a pan of butter and saut\u00e9 the garlic and mushrooms. Cover(so it stays warm) and set aside. At this point, the egg should be just about cooked (if it's not then flip it over for about 30 seconds with a spatula). Remove from the heat and also cover.\nNow time to make the sauce. There are many recipes, they are all similar. And mine goes like this: melt the butter(1/2 Tbsp per yolk), use a double boiler if you have one. If not, get creative; I use a ceramic bowl in a small pot with a little water in the bottom. A microwave is fine for melting the butter, but you'll need something else once you add the eggs. Once it's all melted add the egg yolks and beat vigorously with a wisk, be careful not to cook them to the point of scrambling.

This will allow the PID to run off of AC power\nA Solid State Relay with DC input voltage and AC load voltage.\nA K-Type Thermocouple\nArctic Ceramique or similar thermal paste\nVolt Meter\nDrill\nPhillips Screwdriver\nHeat-resistant wire (Automotive stores or hobby shops will have this)\n2 Spade Piggyback connectors\n2 female and 2 male spade connectors\n2 short, stainless steel small bolts and nuts\nMounting solution for PID (velcro)\nItems 1-3 can often be found on Amazon or Ebay as a kit for as low as $30.

Voila! A beautiful loaf of bread awaits you!\n\nI served the bread with Roasted Cherry Tomato Pasta, the flavors complimented each other beautifully, it would pair well with virtually all pasta dishes.

Rolls? Bake on a day where I have six dishes to prepare and roast a perfect turkey? AND try baking something I\u2019ve never made before?? That would be way too risky! But, never one to turn down an exciting, new kitchen project, I scoured my cook books and took on the challenge. With 2 bags of back up hawaiian rolls from the store of course ;)\nThey were THE best rolls I, and apparently everyone at the Thanksgiving table, had ever had.\nOf course, I was panicked the whole time, but I as soon as I saw them puff up into perfect roll shape after the second rising and smelled the incredible yeasty scent that filled the house as they baked, I knew that they were a success.\nBut nothing prepared me for what a homemade, freshly baked roll tasted like right out of the oven, with a little butter rubbed over the top. Magic. Heaven. Pure comfort and joy. I think I saw my man shed a tear.\nAnd as I bit into the fluffiest, softest and most flavorful roll ever, I wondered\u2026why had I been buying store bought all that time and why had I been so afraid to try baking rolls before? Because, like most folks, I thought only professional bakers knew how to perfectly mix and knead dough just the right way. Because (even though I\u2019m a great cook and bake things like pies and cookies) I thought baking rolls was different. It involved precision, a long process and special knowledge. But it turns out, it\u2019s just about having the right recipe, following directions, and as always, a little practice.\nThat first time, the rolls were great. The second time, they were softer. And the third time, they were fantastic! The secret to super soft fluffiness is to add as LITTLE FLOUR AS POSSIBLE. Initially, it will feel like the dough is too wet and sticky, but you have to trust me on this. I took close up photos of EXACTLY how the dough should look and stick to the bowl to help you guys. Basically, you need to add just enough to be able to barely pull it off your fingers and from the sides of the bowl.\nThat Thanksgiving was ten years ago. And since then, I have made these rolls into garlic rolls for Italian feasts and I even figured out how to pretzel them for incredible sliders. For this Instructable, I decided to make a batch of plain, garlic and pretzel, to show you how to easily make all three using one master recipe.\nSo, if your mouth is watering at the thought of biting into one of these fluffy little delights, grab some flour, eggs, milk, yeast and butter and get baking! Make them plain, garlic, pretzel, or all three and you\u2019ll never go back to store bought rolls again. And, you will become the most popular dinner guest in any household :)\nHappy baking!", "title": "Super Fluffy Bread Rolls 3 Ways: Plain, Garlic & Pretzel!", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Super-Fluffy-Bread-Rolls-3-Ways-Plain-Garlic-Pretz/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "For the Rolls:\n1 cup whole milk\n2.5 tbs unsalted butter\n1/4 cup white granulated sugar + 1 tbs to activate yeast\n1 tsp kosher salt\n1 package \"bread machine\" active dry yeast (can use regular active dry yeast, but bread machine is better)\n1/3 cup luke warm water (preferably 110 to 115 degrees, but 105 to 115 is the standard)\n3 to 3.5 cups all purpose flour\n2 eggs, beaten\nFlaky salt for sprinkling (Maldon or Kosher)\nFor Garlic Topping:\n2 tbs butter, melted\n3/4 tsp granulated garlic\n1/2 tbs minced fresh parsley\nFor Pretzel Coating:\n1/2 cup water\n1.5 tsp baking soda\n1 egg, beaten with 1 tsp of water", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FP3/NG6D/J0IEF81R/FP3NG6DJ0IEF81R.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Gather the Ingredients"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "In a medium saucepan combine the milk, butter, salt and sugar.

I thought the scientific facts in the films were incredible and was most interested in the last meal that Otzi ate before he died. I learned that evidence show, he had undigested Einkorn wheat in his belly, probably from Einkorn bread. I had never heard of this wheat so I did a search because, I thought it would be nice to make some bread using the flour but further investigation brought me to the conclusion; I probably would not find any, because farmers quit planting this wheat in the Bronze years because it did not produce as much crop yield as other varieties.\nLast September I saw \"The Iceman Returns\" and out of curiosity I searched online again to see if I could find the Einkorn flour and sure enough I did and I finally ordered some! I learned that Einkorn wheat is naturally low in Gluten and some people who have a bad reaction to wheat have discovered they can eat it. There are some people who can't eat Einkorn wheat so it is best to consult your doctor before trying it. It is often referred to as Natures true wheat and is said to be the healthiest wheat, as well as the only wheat grain that has never been hybridized and this is why I was so interested in it.\nThe gluten in Einkorn is very different than modern wheat because unlike wheat grown today, the body can digest it. It is higher in protein, iron, fiber, thiamine, and B Vitamins than the modern wheat grown today. Einkorn was near extinction until a few farmers made a choice to grow it for its nutritional benefits.There are many more benefits of this flour than what I list and is well worth the time to check them out.\nFollow through and let's make some healthy nutritious Einkorn wheat bread~", "title": "Non Hybridized Einkorn Ancient Bread", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Non-Hybridized-Einkorn-Ancient-Bread/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Einkorn flour is different than regular wheat flours, in that is naturally low in gluten and it is easy to add too much flour when mixing the dough which leads to failure.\nEinkorn dough should have a very wet and sticky feel to it. Too much kneading of the dough, weakens the gluten which causes the dough not to rise properly.\nA twelve hour limit is recommended for proofing the Einkorn dough in the refrigerator.Longer proofing weakens the gluten.\nA kitchen scale will greatly improve your Einkorn bread making experience, however if you choose not to use one, I recommend to measure out the cups of flour needed by spooning the flour into the measuring cups, then sift and re-measure (by spooning) into the measuring cups for best results.I estimate that the first time I measured by spooning (without sifting), I had a scant cup more flour than I did after sifting. That is a significant amount.\nA Linen couche and a dough scraper are very helpful when making Einkorn bread, because the dough is so wet and sticky.\nWhen baking bread, adjustments are usually required if your Altitude is higher than 3500 feet. I made this loaf by reserving 1/4 cup of the water and a few tablespoons of the flour, until the flour and wet ingredients were added and mixed with a brief wait time. Then I added a couple of tablespoons of water or flour at a time until the dough began to form a ball and still slightly stuck to the surface. When I was finished, I had a scant 1/4 cup of water left over and did not add any more flour than what the recipe called for because I used the reserve for lightly dusting the work area. Our altitude is 35,700 feet and our climate is dry. If your climate is humid you may need to adjust the recipe for that as well.\nPlease note: Before I made this bread, I emailed Jovial and inquired about baking their bread at higher elevations and they mentioned they did not have any experience working with high-altitude baking, so I decided to make the bread according to their directions, with the exception of checking the dough during the rising period and keep an eye on the bread during the baking process. This method paid off for me. I am glad I made their recipe following their instructions, with the exception of reserving some of the flour and water until after the wet and dry ingredients were added and mixed with a brief ten minute wait time before adding any more. Lowering the temperature at 20 minutes also paid off. I am sure I will make more adjustments as I make more Einkorn bread.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOH/K5R3/J0COQYSP/FOHK5R3J0COQYSP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2Y/9GLF/J0COQYSX/F2Y9GLFJ0COQYSX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFD/46VW/J0COQYSY/FFD46VWJ0COQYSY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FES/5BVM/J0COQYT1/FES5BVMJ0COQYT1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSX/U9K4/J0COQYT6/FSXU9K4J0COQYT6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUF/ZL1A/J0COQYT8/FUFZL1AJ0COQYT8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIY/RJMO/J0COQYTB/FIYRJMOJ0COQYTB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDH/6BZP/J0COQYTC/FDH6BZPJ0COQYTC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8C/TMT2/J0COQYTD/F8CTMT2J0COQYTD.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Important Facts About Einkorn Wheat"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Ingredients:\nEinkorn organic all purpose unbleached flour\nActive dry yeast\nSpring Water\nButter or oil\nSugar\nSalt\nUtensils:\nKitchen scale if you have one, Liquid and dry measuring cups and spoons\nnon reactive mixing bowls\nnon reactive spoons or kneading tool\nRubber spatula\n8 1/2 X 4 1/2 loaf pan\nParchment paper\nSaran wrap\nCutting board\nbread knife\nSifter\nDough scraper\nKitchen scissors\nuntreated flax linen couche This is a very useful cloth that helps with mixing and kneading einkorn flour.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQR/Q4OI/J0COQYR0/FQRQ4OIJ0COQYR0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSW/O4UW/J0COR11O/FSWO4UWJ0COR11O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ0/SONL/J0COR11P/FJ0SONLJ0COR11P.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Ingredients and Utensils"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "This was my first attempt to try this recipe and I was expecting to modify Jovial's Einkorn Sandwich bread recipe because of our altitude and I did make slight changes and noted them, but did not change from the original recipe when sharing the recipe here (except for my notes).
