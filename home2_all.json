Here's a trick I developed to prevent milk paint from splattering out of the mixing cup. Take a coffee filter and fold it up into quarters. Use scissors to cut a small hole right at the pointy tip.\nUnfold the coffee filter and cut a straight line up to the hole you just cut in the middle. The hole is necessary so that when the frother is on, the filter won't catch and get caught around the spinning spindle of the milk frother (trust me, I know this from experience).\nAfter the water and milk paint are added to the container, drape the filter over the top of the cup then insert the frother through the hole in the middle. Overlap the filter at the seam and now you're ready to turn on the frother without fear of splashing!

Instead of the usual ratio - 1:1, dilute it with more water to make it more like a stain (about 3 parts water to 1 part milk paint powder).\nSince we're making small batches, I use the tablespoon to measure the water and milk paint. I add the water to the cup first and then the milk paint (although some people swear by doing it the other way around).\nPut on the coffee filter as described in the previous step. Rest the frother on the bottom of the container and apply pressure. Turn it on and lift it up ever so slightly to mix. Work the powder into the water in this pouncing manner for a maximum of 20-30 seconds so it doesn\u2019t over-froth (if it does, there's a fix for that too!).\nRemove the filter and let it sit for a few minutes (go do something else). This will allow the water to absorb into the powder. Give it another quick mix with the frother - or you can simply use a wooden craft stick (which you should also use to periodically mix the paint because the minerals will settle as you paint).\nIf you find that the paint got too frothy, you can let it sit for a while so the bubbles disperse or skim them off and discard them. But who has time to wait when you're excited to get started? I skim the bubbles off.\nClean the Milk Frother\nSubmerge the frother in a cup of water and turn it on to rinse.

Some of these birds live to be over 70 years old, outliving their owners and some require a lot of attention, and all of them need owners to parrot proof their homes, because birds can get sick from things you have in the home like candles, aerosols, and cigarettes, just to name a few.\nHere is an article that could save you a lot of time and money", "title": "Why Teach Your Exotic Bird How to Read", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Why-Teach-Your-Exotic-Bird-How-to-Read/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Birds are very intelligent!

Every once in a while you can catch a few words with no problem. Annette carries yes and no cards with her in case Smirnoff needs them to answer her questions.\nParrots are very social creatures and vocal in their natural environment. They do not like to be left alone and will screech in distress. Smirnoff would screech anytime Annette left the room if he could not see her. His screech was so loud all of our neighbors commented that they could hear him. They laughed about it at the time but had this gone on for very long, I am sure there would have been complaints. Annette lives in the country and neighbors are not close enough to hear him. Smirnoff is her only bird that stresses when she is gone.\nWhen Annette was outside in the yard she would put Smirnoff in Buster's kitty cave and that made him happy because he could see her. Sometimes she put him in time-out if there was no reason for his screeching, but she only does this for a couple of minutes because he usually said \"Smirnoff is a good bird\" and stopped screeching.\nAnnette mentioned that Smirnoff had bitten her on a few occasions and she figured out that his biting issue was usually a balance problem because he had a broken wing from a previous injury before she got him. He uses his beak to grab onto her and that is when he accidentally bites her. Birds use their beaks as a tool for climbing, cracking nuts, and for defense. One night she decided to go downstairs and because of the poor lighting, it was difficult for Smirnoff to see and he bit her when he grabbed onto her. That is when she asked him if he was afraid of the stairs and he touched the yes card with his beak.Most birds have limited night vision.\nBirds also use their beaks for nest building which is a natural habit. You can't get mad at a parrot because he uses his beak to destroy something in the house, when it's his nature to do this. We had a supply of cardboard boxes and would give one to him to chew up and that kept him occupied and happy. Natural wood blocks are good as long as they are not treated or painted, best to double check and make sure the type of wood you are using is safe for birds.\nWhen she first got Smirnoff he chewed on his feathers a lot. The reason he did this, was because he developed the habit because toys and chews were not previously available for him.to chew on. Birds need chews to help them maintain their beaks. At first he was not interested in the things Annette gave him to play with, but as she worked with him, he began to engage with her and play with the toys, solving the chewing problem. Smirnoff spends his time out of the cage, except at night. He is ( only left alone for short periods of time,( another thing to consider before adopting a bird). She usually takes him everywhere she goes even Home Depot~\nThey have finished the bird room so the birds are cage free now. The room is large enough for them to fly. They are working on a large outdoor area for them to spend time outside.\nI am leaning towards most of the problems people have with birds are because the birds are depressed, bored, or stressed because they have nothing to do. These creatures are very active in their natural habitat and when you add the ability to fly for 7000 miles non stop, reference below.

An example will be built, but you do not have to stick to it, as it is fairly big and requires a lot of work. We will discuss that soon. However, I will provide generic design solutions with shape generators made via Tinkercad so you can easily adapt the system to your own needs: With your size, your plant, your construction and your whatever else may be in your mind!\nHi there!\nDo you have plants in your room? Most people have, even students in their dorms. While those emersed air-breathing greenish organic things are growing everywhere you get, you very rarely get to see submersed plants, aquatic plants. Plants, which grow under and optionally also over water. Most people have them in an aquarium. But... what about using aquarium plants as houseplants? With a pot staying somewhere in your room? And the idea was born... .\nIDEA: Take aquatic plants, put them in a transparent pipelike structure so they grow and place them anywhere indoor to have them being a houseplant. Sounds cool!\nPROBLEM: What's about the \"pipelike\" structure? Yeah. That will take a lot of work. It has to look good, it has to met the needs of the plant and, the most important thing, it has to be watertight. Turns out requirement 1 and 3 are to hardest to accomplish. This instructable will present a solution for constructing an individual pipe-structure, flowerpot, aquarium or whatever you want to call it. Let's call it aquapipot, because it sounds cool and it makes the instructable more comprehensive.\nSo this instructable is not strictly bound to a specific thing but to a generic solution you can easily adapt to your own liking. I think that has major advantages, but it requires a little more pre-work to be done by yourself before you can get the parts and start building: Make your plan.\nLET'S GET STARTED with the requirements and a presentation of the example plan!", "title": "Aquapipot: Waterplanter, Aquatic Flowerpot, Aquarium, Pipe Structure - Difficult to Describe, Just Look.", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Aquapipot-Waterplanter-Aquatic-Flowerpot-Aquarium-/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "PLANT: Which one do you prefer?\nIf you want to build your own aquapipot, you have to think the same way like when buying a pot for a \"normal\" plant: You need to fit the pot to meet the plant's needs. So go to your favorite search engine and look out for a cool waterplant!\nMy choice fell on Valisneria Gigantea (see image above). The plant can reach heights up to 2m and it grows straight upwards. It does not branch out over ground, so my aquapipot will be a long pipe at least 2m tall. However, the plant offshoots, so I need a larger diameter of the pipe. I choosed a pipe with 200mm outer diameter and 3mm wall thickness. We want the plant to have enough space to grow, because, you may have already guessed it seing the picture in the beginning, maintenance is not that easy (but there are solutions) :).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHN/S73G/JIOUDPF3/FHNS73GJIOUDPF3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Choose the Plant for Your Aquapipot"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "MATERIAL: Go with acrylic :)\nThe plants needs light and water. To provide both, I will use acrylic pipes and fittings so that light shines through. However, you can also use glass pipes or something else transparent. You could even choose a non-transparent pipe if you install an artifical lightsource.\nAcrylic has a significant advantages: It is widely available in different sizes and shapes (hemispheres, plates, rings, pipes, ...), it can be glued easily and with high strength, it can be thermoformed and it is a thermoplast of which filament is available to 3D-print fittings, flanges, joints and gaskets.\nTip: If you want to build a low-budget solution PET bottles can be considered instead of acrylic pipes. Just look out for a bottle with smooth walls.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3A/SEEC/JIOU11CU/F3ASEECJIOU11CU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Choose Your Material: Best Way to Go With Acrylic"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "CONSTRUCTION: Whatever the plant needs but make it watertight!\nTo prove that the design works, I pretty much maxed out the size for my 15 sqm room. Of course you can build anything you want - bigger or smaller. But seeing this example you get the idea and you have proof of concept:\nWith a pipe 2m long and put up vertically there are some major problems you have to cope with. All in all the water itself is the problem.\nYou first want to keep it in the pipe, so you have to ensure your construction is watertight. This is more important the higher the water-level you have in your aquapot as pressure rises accordingly. E.g. in this example, you have a pressure of about 0.2 bar at the bottom due to approx. 2m water depth. You may avoid this taking a plant which grows more horizontally so you can choose and put up your pipe accordingly (maybe even horizontally).Aquatic moss would be an example.\nSecond, you may want to have some kind of water circulation with a pipe that big. It would be easy to just hang a waterpump in there, but it would not look that good and still, circulation won't be optimal. That is why I choosed to adapt a very common design for a waterpump to fit my construction: The so called air lift pump. The idea is simple: Get a pipe in parallel and let air bubbles rise through it, creating a water stream upwards. Connect it to the big pipe with the plant at the top and the bottom and voil\u00e0, let the water circulate! Also, this looks really good :D but it needs more work. You may avoid this using pipes not that long or you just by placing the air bubbler in the main pipe.\nThird, the construction itself will get quite heavy in the example. However, you can just take a smaller plant and a smaller design. Makes everything easier :)\nDESIGN: To make the design look good in the end, you have to apply your personal design taste. I want to give the pipes an industrial look with flanges and screws and so on. To be honest, there is not very much of a choice as pipes with flanges just look \"industrial\". However, you could apply color or ornaments, e.g. to get a steampunk-design.\nMAKE YOUR SKETCH! Above you see the example sketch. A very simple one indeed. But you not only see the principle of an air lift pump, you can also make out which parts you need.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUH/TIFN/JIOUDQ5E/FUHTIFNJIOUDQ5E.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Choose Your Design and Cconstruction"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The next step is getting the parts. According to your plan, this will lead to a BOM with some acrylic pipes, rings, plates and maybe even hemispheres like in the example. To connect them with each other, you need fittings and flanges you can use with the parts. These are the parts needed for the example (of course you do not need that much filament and also not that much screws):\nMaterial:\n2x 200mm hemispheres\n1x 200mm 2m pipe\n1x 50mm 2m pipe\n1x 1kg acrylic filament (PMMA from Material4Print)\n1x 250g flexible filament (White FlexiSMART from FFFworld, shore hardness 88A)\n3D Printing:\n2x 200mm glue flange\n2x 50mm glue flange\n1x 100mm glue flange\n2x 50mm glue sideflange\n1x 100mm glue sideflange\n2x 50mm flanged curved pipe\n4x 50mm flange seal\n1x 100mm flange seal\n2x 200mm flange seal\nMounting and fixiation:\n200x M4 flanged lens head screw + M4 flanged nuts (non-toothed!)\n3x 200mm clamp for wall mount\nPlant and stuff:\n1x pack of Valisneria Gigantea\napprox. 4kg fine sand\naquarium air pump (Schego WS2)\n8mm silicone tubing and bubbler\nDepending on your construction there may even be fittings readily available for your pipe-diameters. However, the more individual approach is to 3D print your own fittings, pipes, flanges and seals. The usual workflow is to go into your preferred CAD editor and start designing. However, not everyone can use a CAD editor. And also because after my studies I want to have my future flat full of aquapipots, I went for a generic solution which makes the design process of different flanges and pipe-parts much easier. In fact, everyone can profit from it: Parametrized 3D models!\nTo be honest, until now with this instructable I never made any parametrized models. At least not intentionally as somehow every part modeled with boolean operations is parametric. Because of the planters challenge I took a look at Tinkercad a few days ago. To be honest, I once had done a few months before and I had closed the window a minute later because I thought it was a fairly simple online software which does not fit my needs. However, I was put right a few days ago, realizing you can write shape generators with javascript! And that is what makes this instructable generic.\nNow I provide a few links where you see the flanges, pipes and fittings I have designed, like in the pictures. All of them are made with shape generators so they are customizable. Be patient when using the shape generator as I did not optimize the code, nor did I took a lot of care on the parameter naming. I hope it is self-explaining to some point, if not, just ask me. Here are the links to each part:\nGlue flanges and seals (just make it flat to work as seal and make the bores a little smaller, see printed seals next step)\nPipe with one or two bored flanges\nAngled pipe with flanges\n(Angled) Side Flange for glueing in a hole in the side of a pipe\nWith those parts, you should be able to substantiate your plan. I would suggest to make a 3D model if the project is a bigger one. This way you really make sure all the diameters, thicknesses, flange widths and bores match with their counterparts. With this in mind, I think it is good to tell you some errors I made during the design process:\nUse straight numbers for the bore count. If you don't, you cannot rotate the flange in 90\u00b0 steps.\nMake sure you have the right tolerances. You can see it when editing one of the glue flanges: The inner one is designed to be glued to a pipe with 50mm outer diameter and 3mm wall thickness. Notice the thickness of pipe in the sketch is 3.2mm to make it fit perfectly after 3D printing. The collar's main intend is to provide guidance when glueing and to mask up errors on the cut of the pipe. It has nearly no structural use unless you inforce it with triangles. So better take a tolerance too big than too short here.\nDouble check wheather each part fits to its counterpart\nYou may want to refine the parts using Blender or another software. It allows not only to refine meshes but also to add sweeps via the subdivision surface modifier by selecting the appropriate edge.

Also check local dealers, especially when you want to build something really big. As acrylic is a widely used material, there are online shops only selling acrylic parts like pipes, hemispheres, plates and much more in different shapes and sizes. My experience was them having more favourable and versatile offers than Ebay or Amazon.\nThe seals can be 3D printed with flexible filament by scaling down the glue flanges in Z. You can also make a silicon mold or you can buy seals.\nAnother important thing to aquire are the nuts and screws. Choose screws and nuts with (flat!) flanges or use washers instead. You also may want to get stainless parts. They look better and they are water resistant. When you are using saline water, e.g. to grow mangroves or for a marine aquarium, you better use a high-grade stainless steel which can withstand saline water.

The filament can be named differently, e.g. acrylic filament, PMMA filament or even Plexiglas filament. Unfortunately it is not as common as PLA, ABS or PETG. However, it should be no problem getting acrylic filament, maybe even coloured if you want to give the aquapipe some colour features.\nI used PMMA filament from Material4Print (M4P). I used the standard PETG settings which came with the Prusa i3 MK3 but I bumped up the hotend temperature to 260\u00b0C and the heatbed temperature to 100\u00b0C. Prints came out really nice. Possible failures or annoying things you may stumble into:\nMake sure your first layer calibration is good. Too low or to high and it will not stick - yes, also when it is too low as the neighboured layers are lifted up.\nTo improve bed adhesion use a glue stick and use a brim.\nHave an hermetically sealed enclosure or print in a well ventilated area. Acrylic smells pretty bad, even more intense than ABS. I have the misfortune to live in a dorm room so... .Just avoid the printer during printing PMMA. Go outside, have a walk, drink some tea or better make an hourlasting teaparty, you know what I mean. And leave the window open.\nDry the filament. PMMA or acrylic absorbes up to 1.x% water. If your filament makes brizzling noises during printing, dry it. Stop the print. You do not want air bubbles in your part and you do not want it to become less strong. Above there are some microscopic pictures showing a piece of extruded filament with and without air bubbles - the first was wet, the latter dry.\nPrint the parts with a lot of perimeters and 100% infill. You want the parts to be strong. Especially bores are stronger with more perimeters. I used a bit more than 10 perimeters in the example prints, with a 0.4mm nozzle.\nIf you have a bigger nozzle, use it.\nPay attention on warping. Acrylic warps quite alot although it is not like nylon or similar difficult to print filaments. It is even better than with ABS. Just use supports (strong ones!) and, if there are overhangs more than about 30 degrees, the trick is to print very slow.\nPrint the angled pipes like shown in the picture above, with a massive support.

When you have a drill press use it as it not only improves precision but also makes it easier to ensure a slow feed motion so no cracks will occur. A milling machine would be even better if you have one. However, a power drill should also work. Just drill slow and with less pressure/slow feed(!).\nAlso drill the bores for the flange which are not 3D printed. In the example these are the two hemisphere flanges.

Acrylic is highly allergic to that.\nSo better increase saw speed and dedcrease feed motion. Also make sure to use the right saw blades, e.g. blades suitable for PVC. Blades for metal will be ok too.

Stay away from the usual adhesives you use for paper and wood. Also, do not rely on resin or other fancy adhesives. Use adhesive for acrylic :)\nGlueing the parts is more difficult than it seems. I would even say it is the most difficult step in this instructable: Too much glue and the bond seam looks bad, too little glue and it may be leaky and has decreased stability. In fact, better use to much glue than too little.\nThe collars on the flanges make glueing much easier as they hide the bond seam. But still it is a difficult job you may want to learn via practice on several examples before. If you need to wipe away glue leavings, DO NOT do it with your fingers nor do it with a towel or anything else which has no smooth surface! Use wrapping film or a scraper instead. This way, even when glue mets a visible surface, it will stay transparent and glossy so you will hardly notice it on the finished aquapipot.\nHowever, I would only wipe away glue deposits in case of an emergency, e.g. when a glue drop begins to flow over visible surfaces. Here are some pictures of the glued example aquapipot.\nThe latter two pictures are quite important: They show the alignment of the two glue flanges to the angled pipes of the air lift pump.

As said, I live in a dorm room and yes, there are possiblities. You don't need a few thousand dollar tempering oven. All you need is a wardrobe large enough to fit your parts in (I used an IKEA PAX) and a modified fan heater which allows reaching temperatures up to 80 \u00b0C. You also may want a PID to regulate the fan heater, but you can also do it manually.\nFirst clear your wardrobe so that it is empty providing enough space for your parts. Place your parts in it. The best way is to hang them up on a wire or so. It was very tight fit for the big pipe but it works, see the pictures.\nI used a PID first but then switched to manual control as the modified fan heater was switched on and off absolutely, which means the air convection stopped and the temperature difference between up and down inside the PAX became unacceptable.

This is my first \"Instructables\" and also the submission for the planters challenge.\nIn order to come up with the planter design, I tried to incorporate few very trending things in the DIY communities:\n1. 3D printer\n2. LEDs\n3. Magnets\n4. Craft\nAfter spending considerable amount of time brainstorming, I decided to this self-watering planter that can work as a desktop planter with LEDs illuminating it and also as a fridge magnet if you are too tired of the usual souvenir magnets that your friend/family/neighbor gave you of places you have probably never been to. And who wouldn't want to a put a nice planter on a fridge, right?\nAlongside, I also wanted to make it wirefree (when used as a desktop planter) with a fancy switching mechanism. Instead of turning an ON/OFF switch (who wants switches anyways!), I came up with a simple mechanism where if you connect the light and electronic case to the planter, the LEDs automatically turns on and if you detach it, the LEDs turn off. Now that's convenient!\nAnd let's all be honest: keeping plants are fun but watering is an added chore that anybody would want to put aside. For that reason, I also incorporated the self watering mechanism to keep the soil moist and hydrated for few days.\nNow, all these seem like the project will need loads of things and a long time to make. However, that is not the case. I have tried to keep this project as simple as possible to make and with things that you have lying around in your house (assuming you are a DIYer and have a 3D printer). If not, a single order from amazon or couple of trips to dollarstore and an electronic store will suffice.\nWith all these said, let's look at all the materials that are needed:\n1. 3D printer + filament spools (depend on your colour preference).\n2. 3D printed parts (planter, water reservoir plate, LED and electronics holder and cover).\n3. Epoxy\n4. Oil colours\n5. Hot glue gun\n6. Jute rope\n7. Superglue\n8. Wire (you can use the wires from CAT5 cable)\n9. Battery (9V battery)\n10. LED strip\n11. Magnets (x8 ceramic magnets 0.709\" x 0.197\" disc + x4 neodymium magnet 1/8\" x 1/16\" disc)\n12. Soldering iron\n13. Multimeter\n14.

Seeing as I want the planter to be modular I wanted each individual unit to be quite small and easy to print. The design considerations I debated over are as follows:\nThe basic shape came from a honeycomb pattern, as each individual hexagon can fit in with as many others as you like. Thus you can start the set one plant at a time and there is no need to have loads of them from the get go.\nI wanted the planters to be both usable on their own or as groups; either on a bench, table or suspended. Thus I put holes in the design such that they can be tied together as groups, suspended one under another or suspended as a group. These holes needed to be outside the edges of the pot so that it doesn't leak.\nThe planters need to be waterproof so that they don't leak onto the windowsill/table when you put them down or drip onto the floor when you hang them. This is relatively easy to do if your print settings are right but means you need to be careful not to over water your plants.\nSeedlings can dry out quickly if you forget to water them for a day or two and if you water too vigorously you can wash away the seeds before they sprout. So I designed a simple hydroponics system where you put water into a separate container, it travels along a string and waters from the base up into the soil.\nThe planters need to be easy to print and not require any support material such that it doesn't require much post print clean-up or waste any plastic. To do this when I designed the planter I made sure there weren't any big overhangs and the holes were more triangular than round so that there aren't bridging points that need supports.\nTo simplify the design I made it so you tie the planters together rather than have a rigid connection so the designs look simple and allow for a degree of error with the actual prints.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 3: Design Considerations"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "I built the model using Tinkercad. I have used Tinkercad for a while now as it was the simplest free software I found and lets me build simple models quite quickly. I am not an expert with the software but I can give you some of the tips and tricks I have picked up while using it.\nOne of the main things to keep in mind is that Tinkercad is a shape editor, so you build up your model from a series of simple shapes merged together. This can be challenging with very complex shapes unless you can imagine a creative way to put them together. For my model I wanted it to be based off a hexagon but the best way I could imaging putting it together was to build up an individual wall and then duplicate it to make the complete model.\nI played around for a while to get my first version of my model, which took quite a while as I was still trying to rough out the size of everything and how to put it together. I then modified it to get the second version which I was happy with and then I rebuilt it again from scratch to get the final version. This final version was the one I documented as it was the way I put the model together minus all the tweaks and changes made during the first couple of drafts.\nEnough rambling, onto the actual steps I followed. I will go over everything in the same order as my screenshots, not focusing on the dimension but rather the process (when I use a Tinkercad function I will underline it):\nStarting with a basic hexagon (the built in polygon function set to 6 sides), I scaled it up to the desired size\nI added a wedge and stretched it to match the hexagons width before setting the height. I used a wedge as I wanted the sides to be tapered outwards. I then hid (Ctrl +H) the hexagon so it wouldn't get in the way.\nI set the wedge to be a hole on its properties tab and moved the workplane to the slanted side of the wedge. Onto this side of the wedge I added a rectangle that will become the wall of my planter. I set the corner of my rectangle to match my wedge and set it to have a thin height and a width the same as the height of my wedge. This is quite simple to do either by stretching the corner of the shape or using the ruler tool, selecting the wedge to see its dimensions then selecting the block and typing in the same dimensions.\nI then returned the workplane to its default floor before adding in another wedge to reinforce the top corners of my hexagon. I rotated the shape to face upwards and set it to the same height as the wedge. I stretched the sides until they looked right and matched its corner to that of the wedge. Rather than making another one from scratch I just Ctrl + C (copy) and Ctrl +V (paste) another one which I placed on the other side. Seeing as the wedge is set to a hole when I group the shapes the bottom of it will be removed.\nAs the base for one of the walls is done it is time to duplicate them to make the hexagon. Simply select all the objects and press Ctrl + D (duplicate), this makes another set of objects in the exact same place and auto selects them (be careful not to make several duplicates by mistake). The duplicate I rotated by 180 degrees and moved it away to form the opposite sides wall. Now we have two walls.\nRather than making the other walls and struggling to get them to the right spot all you need to do is select both opposite walls and duplicate them again. This time once they are duplicated rotate them by 60 degrees. If you press Ctrl + D to duplicate them again Tinkercad will automatically make the duplicate and rotate it by another 60 degrees to make the remaining walls (it repeats the action you did with the last duplicate). You now have all the sides done.\nNow to put a floor onto the shape I unhid/showed all shapes by pressing Ctrl + Shift + H, I set the ruler to use the mid-point measurement (click on the circle of the ruler to switch between edge or mid-point) and selecting all the walls I could see the mid point then when I selected the hexagon I set it to match the walls.\nWe now have a planter that could be grouped with others, but I still wanted to add holes to hang it from and a spout to water it with.\nFirst I added some tall skinny cylinders to two opposite corners then just like sides I duplicated and rotated them to get all the corners. I left them tall so I could see that they lined up but these are actually the holes for the base hexagon. I turned them into holes and hid (Ctrl + H) them before grouping (Ctrl + G) all the wall shapes together. Now when the are unhid (Ctrl +Shift +H) they can be seen with the walls and floor.\nTime to add a spout. I placed the workplane onto one of the walls and placed a pyramid onto it. This pyramid I then cut in half by grouping it with a hole rectangle and stretched to the desired shape.\nTo make the spout hollow I duplicated the shape, made it into a hole and made it slightly smaller. When I grouped the hollow shape and spout I now had the spout walls done but no hole in the wall for it.\nI hid (Ctrl +H) the spout walls and placed a triangle hole at the desired height. I used a triangular hole as this does not need any form of support when 3D printed. I checked the hole relative to the spout before grouping (Ctrl +G) the walls and hole. The spout is now complete.\nAll that is left is to add the top holes. I shrunk the base holes down so they were out of the way. I then moved the workplane to an inside edge and added a pentagon hole to the surface. I made sure the holes centre matched the shapes centre, I then duplicated and rotated it so that holes went through all sides.\nYou now just need to group everything together and you have a Modular Seedling Planter.\nMy steps are easiest to follow if you follow along in the pictures.

This plastic is quite hard to get your printer settings right, but produces great prints which are strong, durable, and flexible. PETG also has the great property of being food safe and the one I'm using is UV stable so it should be fine in the sun. As PETG has a high melting point you get a strong bond between layers.\nYou also need to think about your print settings such that the walls and base are solid, so that the planter doesn't leak. Also if your retraction settings are right you won't need any clean up afterwards as the models are designed to be printed without any support material.\nAll you do now is take your model and import it into your desired slicer program and slice the model. I use Repetier-Host and Slic3r.\nThese models are quite small so they don't use much plastic but as they have a large amount of surface area and I print surfaces quite slowly each container took about 3 hrs to print. I made a time-lapse of a print so you can watch one of the planters grow. This is my first time making one of these time lapses but they do look quite cool as they turn 3 hours into 50 seconds.\nIf you plan on having a full set of planters I would recommend also printing the water container. This allows you to use a basic hydroponics system to water your seeds and keep them happy.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FH0/8GVI/JIAJOQMP/FH08GVIJIAJOQMP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLK/0Y0A/JIAJOQO1/FLK0Y0AJIAJOQO1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEA/W0DG/JIAJOQN6/FEAW0DGJIAJOQN6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWU/QZIW/JIKK0Z81/FWUQZIWJIKK0Z81.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Printing the Model"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Time for some gardening.\nThe first thing to do is check that your planter is watertight. If your planter leaks you need to be careful what surface you leave it on or where you hang it. A simple fix for leaky planter is to give it a coat of clear spray paint or take a little glue and full the hole up.\nNow if you are going to be using the watering system you need to take a piece of cotton string and push it down through the spout. The string needs to be long enough that it can go from the base of your planter to the top and down to the bottom again, I make the string slightly too long as you can always cut it shorter later. This string will be the tongue that drinks from the water container.\nNext, I put a little square of newspaper in to act as a sleeve for the planter. The idea being that this makes it is easier to take the plants out when they are no longer seedlings. You don't have to put the newspaper in as the planters are tapered the plant should come out relatively easily.\nTake some soil and full your planter 3/4 full. I used the compressed soil that needed to be re-hydrated first. Sprinkle some seeds onto the soil and cover with more soil until the planter is almost full.\nGive the planter a quick watering and your seed is well on its way to growing up big and strong.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F70/W7FV/JIKK10F9/F70W7FVJIKK10F9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0X/2ZK4/JIKK10G5/F0X2ZK4JIKK10G5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNP/LOQV/JIKK10H4/FNPLOQVJIKK10H4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FST/0BTB/JIOU2OHS/FST0BTBJIOU2OHS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX1/SD59/JIOU2OK4/FX1SD59JIOU2OK4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8D/WKO7/JIKK10HZ/F8DWKO7JIKK10HZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9C/X7IO/JIKK10JO/F9CX7IOJIKK10JO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRA/IS9O/JIKK10KM/FRAIS9OJIKK10KM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F54/YJXV/JIKK10N9/F54YJXVJIKK10N9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5Q/SBAX/JIKK10P2/F5QSBAXJIKK10P2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0Q/68O3/JIKK10Q0/F0Q68O3JIKK10Q0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAT/7SE5/JIKK10UK/FAT7SE5JIKK10UK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Planting You Seeds"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "The planters are designed to be modular parts of groups of six.

See the photos as it is kinda hard to explain. A small wire hook makes the threading a whole lot easier.\nOnce all the planters are threaded pull the string tight carefully and tie the two ends together. If you don't want to hang your planters all you need to do is add to the water pot and your are done.\nTo hang the planters what you do is thread a loop from the base holes of two adjacent planters through the two holes at the top and tie it off. Make sure to leave a long length of extra string as it will be used to suspend the planter. Repeat this threading step for each spot between the planter so that you will have all the planters tied to each other and six long strings.\nAs the planters are tied together you should notice that they will be held quite rigidly in place. Take the six long strings and hold them above the planters centre. Decide how tall the hanging point needs to be and tie all the loops together at that height.

When you have small seedlings it is easy to forget to water them for a day and to come home and see them roasted by the sun. Also when watering right on top of tiny seeds you run the risk of washing them away. Hence make a gentle self watering system.\nThe watering system is made up of a small water container that fits in the middle of the ring of planters. The cotton strings that were placed into the planters go into this container and when they get wet the water flows along them and into the base of the planter. All you need to do is full the container once every day or two, depending on the weather.\nTo get the system working; start by printing the water spout file and making sure that it too doesn't leak. Next take the group of planters and carefully move the cotton tongues out the way. Slot the water container into place and put each string into the slot of the water container.

Overly high RPM can cause engine noise as well as loss of Fuel Efficiency, whereas overly low RPM can cause engine lugging and loss of engine power. The gear ratios need to be very carefully designed considering the vehicle weight, engine torque and power curves, intended drivability and performance parameters and of course intended fuel economy.\nThis part is very simple.

Be cautious since with rotary tools it is possible plastic to melt from heat.\nCut frames backplate 0,5cm smaller than planters top\nGlue backplate to planter (i used small screws to hold it since i was having trouble keeping the backplate to desired place)\nCut the reeds using a saw to few cm larger than planter height.

On the long end i preferred to leave some wood outside the \"box\".\nSince this box is not stable enough to continue i added a \"cross\" for support and four small sticks on the sides so my hut floor to be placed.\nMeasure 2 sticks a bit larger than with the existing ones on short edge of your created box and mark them with a pencil.\nPlace them on the short sides\nMeasure 1 stick that will fit between the short sides sticks you just glued and cut it.. if it is a bit bigger use a sanding paper until the size is correct.\nFor the front side, we need to leave space for a door. Cut a small stick and glue it. Leave a space that it looks normal for a door and place a stick to the rest.\nNext the long sticks must go to the long edge and continue with the same way.. short edge-long edge -sort egde\nWhen you create the first 2-3 rows of your walls measure the inside of your hut and cut flat sticks for the flooring. It is better to do it early so it is easier to put them to place. I used sanding paper again in order to make small adjustments.\nWhen i reached the fifth row i decided it was a good height to have windows. As with the door, cut smaller sticks and place them to create your windows (this was the most time consuming part since you need lots of small sticks)\nWhen you reach desired height of windows start placing full sticks.\nRoof\nNext part was the roof.\nMeasure the short side of your hut and cut a stick longer than that so your roof ends outside of your walls (on my hut size it was around 2 cm bigger)\nCut another stick smaller by 4 stick tops than the previous one. You can measure it like the photo below.\nI started with 2 stick tops smaller but i end up with a very high roof as you can see in photos.. so for most cases .. 4 sticks will be fine.\nCut again a smaller stick (by 4) than the previous one until you end up with a few mm stick (for the top)\nNow you should have a set of sticks that can form a triangle. Cut another set with the same dimensions.those two will be the sides of our roof.\nStart with the larger stick and center the next one and glue it (on flat surface). Continue gluing the rest of the sticks and do the same with the other set.\nUntil the two triangles set, we must cut our beams. Each beam must have the same size as the long edge of our hut. Cut as many sticks as the \"steps\" of each triangle.\nPut the two sets vertically (this is a bit tricky to put them vertically and stay there) and glue the first beam on the lower step of the triangles. Now glue the second on the exact opposite direction.\nGlue the next stick to the higher step and the next one to the exact opposite.\nI find it much easier using small boxes to keep the triangles in place until the glue of the first 4-6 sticks set and roof start keeping its shape.\nContinue by gluing the rest of the sticks on each step.\nMeasure and cut the edges of flat sticks so the end of the flat stick touches on beam and the beam below is roughly at the middle of flat part. I preferred to keep the rounded edges of the flat sticks, but you can also cut them if you like it). Test fit them before you start gluing them.\nGlue the first row and when glue sets continue with the second one. At the top there we have two options, cut the flat pieces with angle so the fit or just but a beam (as i did)\nFinally if you dont want to glue permanent the roof to your hut, you can create \"stops\" by adding beams on the bottom of your roof so it does not fall. measure your beams with your hut perimeter of your top side of your hut.\nBase of hut\nI did not wanted my hut to be at the soil directly so i created a base.\nI align on a flat surface flat sticks and measure it so they are bigger than my hut few mm from the sides of the hut, and few cm on the front so i can create a balcony.\nI glued horizontal flat sticks to keep them in place. when glue was set, using sand paper i sanded the edges to be roughly level. I glued 4 more flat sticks around my base so it has some height from the ground.\nPut it all to together\nwhen all parts are completed put them together without gluing them so you can see the fit.

This is where the water will be held, where the pump will be, and where the fountain will drain into. It has a slot in the back for the pump's power cord. The top part is a rectangle that I cut the top off at an angle. This gives the slope the water will need to run down. I added a cylindrical area to the top where the fountain will be. The water will then flow down the track and over the edge. I used a voronoi shape generator to create a \"rock\" effect for the water to trickle down. The top is shorter (in length) than the bottom, so there will be room for the water to fall into the reservoir.

Well, if you have ever tried to find a perfect sphere it\u2019s not easy! I bought ball after ball and cut them open. Nope, not smooth enough. Basket balls have wierd seam lines inside. Other balls shrink to a limp skin. Plastic orbs are next to impossible to find\u2026 Soooo, I had to do what I usually do; make one.\nMy \u2018Go-To\u2019 method of making a mold always seems to save me.\nWhat you need to make the Giant Geode Planter Mold\nOne box of corn starch\nOne tube of 100% Silicone Caulking\nOld bowl\nGloves and good ventilation (super smelly stuff!)\nCaulking gun, knife to cut it open\nA smooth well inflated ball (cheap kids play-ball)\nHave your \u2018master\u2019 ball ready by sitting on a bowl for stability. Squeeze the entire tube into the bottom of the bowl that is well filled with the corn starch. The intention is to keep it suspended in the starch so that it does not start to stick on the sides. Keep it in one mass, tossing and working in more starch so to get less and less sticky. Try to keep a layer of starch between it and your fingers as well.\nAfter it absorbs more and more starch it will start to become moldable as it won\u2019t stick to the fingers as much. This is so much like making a dough (I guess my years working at a bakery helped!).\nRoll in your hands to make a ball of even consistency.\nFlatten the \u2018dough\u2019 on a flat surface that has a dusting of corn starch to about 1/4\u2033 thick.\nThe mix starts to set pretty quickly so immediately place it over your form ball and smooth it out. Do not worry about the edges or excess. I was aiming to have a good 1/2 of the ball or bit more covered. It will usually set with in 30 minutes I find.

It has to have some character, I\u2019ve always marvelled at the way that lava rock is made, cooled lava from a real volcano. It is available as the internal rock for BBQ\u2019s and also as a landscape type mulch. I used both types, but the bagged lava rock was larger and more colourful.\nWhich Concrete Mix to use:\nI am always trying to get so much done (life of a blogger & maker) so I am happiest if I can use one of my quickset concrete mixes. I used the Quikrete Fastset Allcrete on this project but the Rapidset Cementall will also work here (it ends up lighter colour) Both these mixes can work at various consistencies. I did try a few variations and the results were all great.\nIf you would rather not see the any of the stones in the final form you can mix a very fluid mix and let it run between the rocks that line the mold. If you want to see more of the rocks you can use it more as a thicker mortar and just have it between the rocks.\nYou should experiment\u2026 I did realize that it is strong and holds the rocks together even if there are some empty voids.\nThe Method:\nThis is not a perfection type of orb, it has a lot of character and will be quite unique. There is somewhat of an element of magic here as to how it turns out; but that is what makes it so refreshingly unique.\nThe ingenious thing about a sphere is that you can work in partial portions since IS all the same curve!

Trust me on this. :D\nAnything they can get to will be touched, dragged, pulled, chewed, humped, spit on, and maybe even peed on if you aren't paying attention. And some of those things are sure to be dangerous to the puppy!\nSo instead of chasing your pup around all day or realizing there's a sudden silence and you don't see the puppy around and then panicking - puppy proof in advance! It's good for both for your sanity and the safety of the puppy.\nPuppy proofing can also help with house training when combined with crating when you're not home and containing your puppy when you are home!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FR3/TW6P/JIETZT8S/FR3TW6PJIETZT8S.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Why You Should Puppy Proof Your Home"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "These areas will include the living room, dining room, and any hallways, as these areas are generally larger and hard to be blocked off completely with the use of baby gates and pens.\nHere are some general hazards to look out for:\nCORDS: Hide cords behind furniture, or tack them to the wall with cable clips. Secure excess hanging cord with zip ties.\nCHARGERS: Chargers are especially dangerous because they can be broken into smaller pieces. Keep them on surfaces that are out of reach and zip tie the excess cable.\nHOUSEPLANTS: Many plants are toxic to plants and dogs. (Some may cause upset stomach, some cause severe swelling, and some can be fatal. Check here for more information.) Hang plants or put them on counters or the tops of shelves.\nELECTRICAL OUTLETS: Invest in outlet covers if your puppy seems too interested! You can also buy outlet covers that cover the cords that are plugged in - just in case you puppy decides pulling cords out of the wall i is their new favorite game.\nRIPPED OR TORN FLOORING: Little pieces of string from rugs and carpets can become a fun game while you're not watching. (The corner of a crappy carpet in our hallway is one of our only puppy causalities.) Vinyl or wooden flooring with exposed damage can become a chew toy.\nSMALL OBJECTS: If you're a fan of knickknacks or have open storage on low shelves, move those items up and out of the puppy's reach. Anything tiny enough to go in the mouth will be in the mouth.\nTALL OBJECTS: Anything wobbly and tall should be secured to the walls. If an item can't be secured to the walls, try leaning it into a corner or weighting it so it can't be knocked over.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0Q/CLR4/JIETZULV/F0QCLR4JIETZULV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Puppy Proofing General Living Areas"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "A bathroom contains quite a bit for such a tiny room!

Alternatively, set them on the toilet tank.\nRUGS AND TOWELS: These are quite easy to tear up, even for a young puppy. Keep an eye on your puppy anytime they're around them.\nLITTERBOXES: If you have cats, chances are you've got a litterbox in your bathroom somewhere. I recommend getting a top-entry litterbox if you don't have one already! Litter can cause significant and dangerous blockages in a puppy's intestinal tract, and eating cat feces can be dangerous as well.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ4/RBRE/JIETZT4N/FZ4RBREJIETZT4N.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Puppy Proofing Your Bathroom"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "You may choose to simply keep bedrooms closed during house training or until the puppy has learned not to chew on everything. But since Charlie's crate is in our bedroom and he spends time in there with us at night, we decided to puppy proof it.\nBedrooms aren't the most dangerous places, but it's important to be mindful about keeping cords and chargers away and organized. You'll also want to keep closets and drawers shut to keep the puppy from rooting around and finding trouble. I also keep my bedroom plants out of his reach.\nHere are some other things to look out for:\nLAUNDRY BASKETS: Eating laundry can lead to blockages and vet visits, so it's important to move the laundry somewhere safe or teach the puppy immediately that the laundry basket is a no-go.\nSHOES: Shoes are especially tempting for puppies - they're like big toys! Keep shoes on a shoe rack or in a closet to make them less accessible.\nCLOTHING: Make sure any clothing is either put away or in the laundry basket. A puppy is sure to love your smell and will seek out stray socks, underwear, and anything else left within reach.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJM/SX1P/JIETZSX9/FJMSX1PJIETZSX9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Puppy Proofing Bedrooms"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The kitchen has so many tempting things.

As for recycling bins, I recommend keeping them up out of reach or even moving them outside of a back door. You never want to encourage digging in the trash or recycling.\nFLOORS: I try to keep the floors in the kitchen swept often, as you don't want to create a scavenger pup that roams the kitchen at every chance looking for scraps. You may be cooking with ingredients puppy can't digest, so it's important they aren't eating random things off the floor!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2C/EQTK/JIETZSTF/F2CEQTKJIETZSTF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Puppy Proofing the Kitchen"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Making Your Yard Safe\nIf you're lucky enough to have a fenced in yard, have a walk around and pick up anything you don't want in the puppy's mouth.

I never know what trash may blow into the yard from neighbors' trashcans or what previous tenants have left out there. I may live in the middle of nowhere, but I find so many strange things in my yard I don't want my dogs getting ahold of. (Though let's be honest, mostly beer cans and golf balls.)\n\nMaking Your Garage Safe\nTo be honest, we tend to keep Charlie out of the garage entirely. We have more of a warehouse than a garage and there are so many dangerous things in there: power tools, paint, glass, pvc, heavy hand tools, scrap wood, auto fluids, etc.\n\nBut if you know your pup has a chance of being in there, I recommend buying some cheap metal or plastic shelves to keep dangerous liquids out of reach. You'll also want to either secure tools and materials scraps to the walls using racks or keep an eye on the pup at all times.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWD/JC64/JIETZSPS/FWDJC64JIETZSPS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Puppy Proofing Your Yard and Garage"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "It's my firm belief that a puppy should either be crated, contained, or within your eye line on a leash at all times! (With the minority of that time spent crated if possible - Charlie mostly sleeps in his at night or when we leave the house.)\nIt's not a puppy's fault for chewing and getting into things: they're just being curious! It's your job to keep them safe via crating or containing, or by being nearby while they're leashed to tell them no and teach them that's not ok.\nCRATING\nAs stated above, Charlie really only spends time in his crate while we sleep at night or if we're gone during the day. We crate him because it greatly speeds up house training and keeps him and our house safe when we're not able to watch him.\n\nCONTAINING\nYou can buy puppy \"play pens\" that will allow you to keep the puppy close and give them room to run around a bit. We got one for Charlie early on so I could work. I would put his bed, food, water and some toys inside and he'd keep himself busy for a bit. This was especially great because I could set it up on our tiled kitchen floor to avoid cleaning up accidents on carpet.\nYou can also buy a couple baby gates and install those. We use one to block off the kitchen and living room from the rest of the house.\n\nLEASHING\nCharlie is often on a leash, both inside and outside. When Charlie was very young and tended to pee every 15 minutes, I kept him on an eight foot leash attached to my belt loop via a carabiner. This allowed me to move around the house and do what I needed to do while watching him. It's easy to tell if he's squatting or getting into something this way!\n\nOutside, we keep a 30 foot leash on Charlie in most cases. This gives him the freedom to run, but won't let him get too far away. This is especially important if you have an unfenced yard and when the puppy is very young and hasn't learned to come to you yet.\n\nI also employed the 30 foot leash in teaching Charlie to recall (or come to me) consistently. When he didn't listen, I'd tug at the leach while saying \"Charlie, come!\" and reward him with an enthusiastic \"Yes!\" we he turned to come to me. And of course I gave him a treat every time. :D", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FEL/TEX8/JIETZV1I/FELTEX8JIETZV1I.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: How to Keep Puppy Safe When You Are and Aren't at Home"}], "channel": "Pets"}, {"category": "Home", "description": "Lassi is a popular traditional curd-based drink widely used in India during the summer.

The Challenge. Big windows provide wonderful light. Problem is that at night they allow anyone passing by to look into the house. Even if you don't need them for privacy you are losing a lot of light to what becomes a 'dark void' once the sun sets. So you need screening... blinds, curtains, shades\nTraditional shades. They require daily attention and always have a cluttered look.\nPrivacy Screens. A clean, modern solution. Anyone can install with the most basic household tools.\nAs a General Contractor... in san francisco we were always asked to install privacy screens for offices and conference rooms. After passing on the fee of $400+ per window (yes, sf was pricey even 10 years ago) I decided to jump in and start applying film.

No need to buy a custom tool.\nOptional Materials (shown in photo):\nSqueegee - I bought this little guy 10 years ago and only used it for installing film. It was important to my clients that the installation was dust free... honestly, not necessary if you use newspaper to clean the window first. Probably should actually bring it into the shower for cleaning the glass... (here's a mini squeegee at $13)\nCutting Surface - always handy for crafts\nRuler - just need a way to transfer approximate dimensions\nApplication Tool Kit - this $10 application kit is worth a look but not worth buying... shown here.

I never found it necessary but if you're doing a few and don't mind the expense ($15+) you may find it worth it.\nIf you want to buy in bulk you won't find on amazon.

It can depend on the mould shape, the size, how much detail there is and how thick you personally want it to be.

It's going to depend on your oven how long it's going to take. General recommendations are 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C/Gas Mark 6. It's going to depend on how your oven behaves. With my oven (gas) I have it on as hot as possible as it tends to run cooler than it should, and then check every 10 minutes to see what progress has been made. It usually takes between 10 to 20 minutes for them to melt. Once you have a non-lumpy, shiny surface, you should be good to remove the mould from the oven. If you find you haven't put enough beads in and can see the bottom of the mould in places, you can drop a few more in now then leave it in the oven for longer.\nWhen they're done, take them out. If you're putting a hole in at this stage, see the next step. Otherwise, leave them to harden for about 10 minutes, then you can pop them out of the mould. Be careful, because the mould can still be hot at this point, so handle carefully or wait until it's cooled properly (especially if kids are involved).\nBecause this is a quick and dirty home DIY project using cheap craft bits you may have to hand, you're not going to get perfection - expect some bubbles here and there.

The thing to remember here is that the rapid spinning of the drill bit against an object causes friction and so generates heat. As these are plastic, it will cause the stuff getting drilled out to melt and then harden on the drill bit. There's probably some way to do this without causing that, but I don't have much to do with drills. Instead, I recommend that you use some cheap as chips drill bits from a discount store that you don't mind messing up.

If I hadn't had the material on hand, I would have made the steps 12-inches wide (instead of sixteen), and I think this could be made from a single 24- by 48-inch piece of 3/4-inch plywood.\nTools and Materials:\nOne-half sheet of 3/4-inch plywood (I used Baltic birch, which is pricey, but any plywood would do with the right finish).\nJigsaw\nRotary saw\nSquare -- I also used a speed square, but you can get by with a carpenter's square.\nMarking pens\nUtility knife\nPocket hole jig\nAbout 50 1 1/4- inch stainless steel pocket hole screws (if you're using hardwood, like Baltic birch, get the fine thread screws).\nOrbital sander and sandpaper (various grits).\nVarious clamps\nOutdoor urethane sealer and brushes.\n2-Foot length of carpet runner (cut in quarters to cover the four steps).\nHeavy duty stapler and mallet\nContact cement\n2-Foot long piece of \"Dual Lock\" fastener material (It works like velcro, but instead of hooks and loops it just has only one side. Two pieces of this material will lock to each other. Velcro would probably work, but I had this so I'm using it.)\nNote: I put this project together using a pocket hole jig. I'm not shilling for the manufacturer, I just think they are a quick and easy way to knock a project together. Because I also plan on using the steps myself, I decided to add cleats under each step, which sort of makes the pocket hole jig superfluous. I do think these make really strong joints, and the cleats under the steps may not have been necessary, I just didn't want to take a chance. The upshot is that you don't really need to use a pocket hole jig at all, you can just screw on the cleats and screw the steps to the cleats.", "title": "Dog Steps", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Dog-Steps-1/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Cut two, 6-inch wide by 48-inch long pieces for the sides, and four 7 1/2-inch by 16-inch steps. Also, cut a couple of 4-inch by 16-inch braces, and three sets of 1-inch by 6 1/2-inch \"cleats\" to add support under the steps. If you started with a good, square 16-inch wide strip of plywood, you can cut all the steps and brace pieces from that strip and all will fit flush between the side pieces. It's not important that steps and braces be any particular length, but they must all be the same length. I cut the steps from various pieces leftover from another project, and it was really hard to get perfectly square cuts on the short pieces using a circular saw. Tiny variations in squareness and length made it impossible to get the final frame perfectly square. If I decide I can't live with the skewness, I may just add a few more strips of carpet where the steps rest on the tailgate.\nIn retrospect, I wish I had just used a fresh piece of wood. I don't like using the heavy circular saw, but that's what I have so I take my time and try to make the setups, as square as possible, clamping a jig next to the line to get a straight cut. Just be sure you're cutting on the right side of the line for your measurements. Also, to keep the wood from splintering, don't set the depth of the cut too deep. The jig I'm using in the pictures is one I made after watching the guys on \"This Old House\" make one. I'm sure there are instructables here describing how to make a jig like this for your circular saw.\nOnce you have the parts cut, lay out where your steps will be attached. I made each step 8-inches high, including the 3/4-inch board for the step. One of the pictures shows how I used a carpenter's square with a speed square to measure up 8-inches from the back of each step to the front of the next step. Lay out the four steps, drawing lines for the top and bottom of each tread. Trim the ends of the side pieces to make a notch where the steps will rest on the tailgate.\nI made the top part, where the steps lean against the tailgate, 1 3/4-inches wide to allow for the step, plus the 1-inch cleat. I think this will be plenty of material to support the weight of the dog or a person (okay, I'll admit that I'm also planning to use these steps to get in and out of the pickup). You can round the ends or make straight cuts, as suits you. Remember, though, if you trim any wood from the lower corner, where the steps meet the ground, you will be changing the height and angle of your steps. My tailgate is 33-inches off the ground; I measured 33-inches outward, from a spot directly below the edge of the tailgate to make a 45-degree angle. It happens that this was pretty close to 48-inches (with the added thickness for the top step). If your tailgate is at a different height, you will need to change the length or angle of the steps.\nA good check at this point is to park on level ground and lean a cut-out side piece against the tailgate. Use a level to find out the angle your steps need to be at, relative to the side piece, to be level. Draw a line. Make that your angle for all the steps.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTV/M6HA/JIAJWLAU/FTVM6HAJIAJWLAU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX4/FWI9/JIAJWLAX/FX4FWI9JIAJWLAX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX8/JOSZ/JIAJWL72/FX8JOSZJIAJWL72.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMA/N75Q/JIAJWL6T/FMAN75QJIAJWL6T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9U/GRPS/JIAJWLAW/F9UGRPSJIAJWLAW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5N/N5RR/JIAJWL6P/F5NN5RRJIAJWL6P.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Mark and Cut the Plywood"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I bought a pocket hole jig a while back, and it seems like every project provides an opportunity to use this simple setup.

The pocket hole jig makes a strong joint, but I don't trust it to support my weight on these steps. The cleats add sufficient support to make me feel secure.\nI drilled three pocket holes on the underside of each end of each step. Similarly, the brace pieces, that will be attached inside the lower edge of the side pieces, get a couple of holes at each end.

Most of the step is going to be covered with carpet, but get the edges where the carpet doesn't cover.\nI sanded everything with 80-grit paper, then went over the side pieces with 40-grit, and something finer that I don't remember. They came out nice and smooth. I didn't sand the step pieces very much, as they will be covered with carpet.\nWhen you're done sanding, wipe the parts down with a cloth. I put some mineral spirits on my cloth because that's what an old carpenter told me to do.\nI put one coat of outdoor urethane on each side, being careful to get all the edges.

In this way it created a comfortable fit at the top and bottom of where the pole inserted into the post. Therefore if I really needed to, the whole structure could be lifted off the 4 poles. No pole to post fixing was required - the structure weight is enough to keep it all stable.

I've actually finished something before the birthday arrives (usually its days/weeks/years...later).\nMy wife's happy - the roses will have something to grow up and the arbour gives structure to the garden.\nOn the whole I think the project went well and I plan to build a \u2018narrower\u2019 one as well at some stage - all part of my wife's design. I like the different colours of the oiled woods as they're different hardwoods and how this contrasts with the painted structure - it will soften up once greenery is enveloping it. Still uncertain about the ground fixing /pole method but its very sturdy so time will tell. Working with recycled wood is time consuming but if you put time into the prep then the end result is better, and at least the wood isn\u2019t going into landfill. Generally my philosophy is if you make a mistake or have an issue you have 3 choices - start again, cover it up or make a feature out of it. Usually the last 2 work. If you're buying softwoods that are exterior grade and pretty much the sizes you need then build time would be halved and the cost would still be lower than a mass produced one. The steel spike post fixing method would work fine - just develop a \u2018skirting\u2019 to cover it up.\nJust to let you know even the hardwood offcuts I can\u2019t use gets passed to someone else who will use them in his projects.

I expect if you're jumping into the project you have a few laying around... also great to stop into your local Habitat Restore.\nI used an old cabinet door for this most recent version. I used a waterproof paint to protect the door and the entire hutch. The paint is use for surfaces exposed to standing water.

When I first started, I was opening the freezer door what felt like every 10 minutes. Since i've timed it out, luckily, you don't have to do that! Woot!\nLeave the bowl of oil in the freezer for 60 minutes.\nRemove the bowl from the freezer (At this point, it will have the beginnings of a white film on the top)\nUsing your hand mixer, at high speed, mix the oils very well. 3-4 minutes. At the end of this first mixing, the oils will begin to look opaque, but still liquid.\nPut the bowl back in the freezer for 15 Minutes.\nRemove Bowl from freezer and mix well. It will be a brighter color, and will be harder on top, but blended, will look like garlic butter sauce.\nAdd in your aroma oils of choice! For a batch this size, I use a full 10 ml. bottle of essential oils. Pour in the oil and mix for another minute. I decided to use a premixed blend from Lotus Touch. Purchased here.

I've used Tupperware, canning jars, recycled containers of all kinds for my personal use butter. For the 'gift' versions, I do like to be consistent and professional. I purchase 4oz containers here. Please note, at Bulk Apothecary, Lids are purchased separate from the containers. Be sure to pick up both.\nUsing your spatula, put product into the bottom edge of the jar first, then fill in the middle. I tap the container on the counter to release any air bubbles that have been trapped. Keeping the jar clean, I wipe the edge clear of any spills and put on the lid.\n*Once packaged, you can store these in the fridge for 6-8 months.\nSince I live in Texas, right now, it's so wonderful to take a jar of this butter and apply right out of the fridge. It's cooling to the touch, and the texture is so silky. There's nothing better. *I do have to warn the people I give this to to keep below 75\u00ba F.--They get soft in my house, but don't turn to liquid-- As it's made of oil, it does melt in the summer sun. When transporting, I do use cooler bags to keep them solid.*\nOnce you have put your Butter in a suitable container, then ENJOY! You are finished and you will LOVE the way this feels.

So I tried to make my own, mainly made from cardboard and mortar, keeping the cost low while having an aesthetic result, and allowing for an easy replacement of the cardboard.\nThe good thing is that my cat likes it so much that she forgot about my sofa!\nThe size, shapes and finishes shown in this instructable are examples. The size can vary depending your needs (although I would not recommend to make it smaller than 60cm), the foot and cardboard pieces shapes can be anything you want, and the white finish I choose can replaced by any concrete style or color you prefer. You can even use wood instead of mortar for the foot and top, so be creative!

They will also choose a material on which they can dig their claws, and leave marks. Like a sofa.\nOn the other hand, some says cats scratch as a part of their scheme of world destruction.

I used 4kg of mortar, which is enough for my 3.5kg cat; if yours is heavier, you might want to use more.\nYour can get a lot of information in this concrete class; it gives some hints to give a custom finish to the molded parts, in case you do not like the white aspect of this DIY. We will use mortar instead of concrete, because it is easier to obtain a smooth surface using mortar (concrete contains gravels).\nYou will need a big bowl of about 24 cm side length (or diameter) as a mold (its size and shape may vary depending your taste and supplies). As you are going to pierce a hole in it (for the threaded rod), the best choice is a cheap plastic basin. I found a square one with rounded edges, which gave a nice shape to my scratching post foot.\nThe foot must contain a captive nut on which the threaded rod will be screwed on. This threaded rod is the backbone of the post, and gives its sturdiness to the cardboard tower. So once you have found the proper basin, you will have to drill a 8mm hole in its center.\nPouring the mortar in the basin with the whole rod inserted is not going to be convenient, so you will have to cut a small part of the rod (about 4cm long) as temporary guide.\nIt is better to lube this rod to help extracting it once the mortar is set (I did not lubricate it, but was nevertheless able to extract it). Screw a first nut at one of its extremity, then another one 1 cm farther. Insert this rod into the hole, so that the nuts are inside the basin, then fix the rod by adding a washer and a third nut on the other side. Make sure there is enough space to add a fourth nut on top of this last one, as these two nuts will be necessary to extract this temporary guide. It is also important for the guide to stay straight, so ensure you have some supports on which to place the basin so that the guide is not pushed away.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMU/YLD2/JI4UIF1P/FMUYLD2JI4UIF1P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK9/XZRW/JI4UIFNU/FK9XZRWJI4UIFNU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH8/1PD7/JI4UIF3H/FH81PD7JI4UIF3H.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: First Step : Preparing the Mold for the Foot"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "It is now time to mix the concrete with water. You could do this directly in the basin (like I did), just take care to not disturb the guide; using another dedicated bucket may be easier. Before manipulating mortar, keep in mind that the powder is very thin and alkaline, so it is best to protect yourself from inhaling it or covering your hands with it. Use rubber gloves, dust mask and eye protections for your safety.\nPour the water slowly, step by step, and mix thoroughly before adding more water. Again, the concrete class gives a good visual reference of what a good concrete should look like.\nOnce satisfied with the look, you will have to remove the bubbles that got trapped in the mix. This is done by vibrating the basin, the best way being the use of a sanding machine : remove the sanding paper, place the machine against the basin and move it on all sides. Do not forget the corners, they are sturdier than the walls, so as a result the bubbles are more difficult to remove.\nIf you do not have a sanding machine, you can tap on the basin using anything somewhat heavy, like a small hammer, a screwdriver handle, etc...\nYou should see bubbles popping on the top of the mortar. Keep in mind that, if you choose the same white look as my post, the last bubbles holes will be filled with wall putty, so do not worry!\nYou can now let it set. It is important to cover the basin with some plastic wrap, so that the mortar keeps its humidity, and to refrain the need to unmold the foot before about one week : mortar must set for a long time in moist conditions to be strong.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTC/4BXA/JI4UIHBF/FTC4BXAJI4UIHBF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Second Step : Pouring the Mortar for the Foot"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "I initially thought to use some wood to cover the post, but I actually tried something else to get the same style as for the foot. So I molded a kind of 'broken brick' with mortar; here is how to do the same.\nYou will need a square box about 10cm wider than the cardboard pieces, and some paper.\nThe following instructions are hard to explain, so dot hesitate to refer at the picture! Crumple the paper and put it in the box so that there is a space in the center, to act as the mold for the mortar. The paper folds will give the 'broken' look to the mortar brick. Once satisfied with the look, use some glue to fix the paper, and cover it by a plastic wrap to make it waterproof. Make sure the plastic wrap follows the folds.\nAs you did for the foot, add a piece of threaded rod in the center of the box.\nThen prepare some more mortar, and pour it into the mold. Use a small stick to ensure the mortar goes everywhere in the folds, but take care to not piercing the plastic layer. Remove the bubbles like we you did for the foot. Again, wrap the mold with plastic to contain the moisture, and let it set for one day only, because we are going to work on it while it is still not to hard.\nThe next day, unmold the brick, and extract the threaded rod. Use the drill to enlarge the hole, so that the brick can slide along the rod. Do this gently to avoid breaking the mortar. There is little chance the brick looks right at this step. The mortar not being fully set, it is still easy to grate and file it to trim it, and enhance its 'broken brick' look.\nOnce done, wrap it again and let it set for one week.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F97/P61O/JI4UKFA6/F97P61OJI4UKFA6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Third Step : Molding the Top of the Post"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Now that you have to wait for the mortar to set, lets gather cardboard.

It is up to your taste (and time actually), and I would be happy to see your creations! Some advice : use a sharp knife to get nice cuts, and prepare a pattern to quickly cut the cardboard. Having to measure and draw each shape would be a waste of time.\nOnce having a 50cm tall stack, you will have to drill a hole in the center of the cardboard pieces for the threaded rod.

Of course, you can leave the foot as is, if you prefer! If you choose to apply putty, do it step by step (do not try to fill the bubbles in one time), and sand it after each layer. It is important to use a sanding block if you want to get a clean finish.\nYou now have to extract the guide from the foot: screw one nut on the rod, and lock it in place using a second nut. These nuts should allow you to unscrew the guide from the foot. I had to gently tap mine with a hammer, but again I did not lube it. Once done, you can screw the final threaded rod, cut at 60cm long.\nI treated the top 'broken brick' as the foot : wall putty and sanding, to give the brick a smooth white finish.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2N/BOUQ/JIAJM5QW/F2NBOUQJIAJM5QW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD3/XPPK/JI4UIF4V/FD3XPPKJI4UIF4V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFU/TA05/JI4UKFA2/FFUTA05JI4UKFA2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Fifth Step : Finishing the Foot and Top"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "You now should have a foot with a threaded rod, lots of cardboard pieces and a top brick.

So I chose to twist the cardboard tower, to hide my mistakes. Luckily, I actually prefer the tower this way... Here is again your choice, straight or twisted tower! When satisfied with the result, screw the top nut a little more, so that the cardboard do not rotate to easily.\nThere is still one thing to settle : the top nut is not pretty. I personally have access to a 3D printer, so I choose to print a low poly cat, designed by xavab29, slightly modified to contain a nut. With sanding and white paint, it completes the tower.

There are two problems to solve : the first one is to to get your cat to like the post, the second one is to get your cat to stop scratching the previous scratching area.\nIn order to maximise the chances your cat uses the post, you will have to place it near the place he likes to be. Furthermore, the post must not be hidden; remember the cat is scratching to mark its territory, so the post must be seen by anyone passing by! As noted in the introduction, you should not have used materials with strong smell, as it could deter the cat from using the post. Let him take some time to get accustomed to this new thing in its living space, and do not force him to use it. It could be useful to show him the post and pet him near it. Try not to grab his pawn in order to mimic a scratching, because this will likely get him stressed, thus make him look at the post with suspicion. I read somewhere that thyme is liked by cats and tends to excite them, so I added some between the cardboards. My cat used the scratching post pretty quickly, but I can not be sure the reason was the thyme!\nThe second problem is to disaccustom your cat from his previous scratching area. Luckily, once the cat starts scratching the post, there are chances he will stop scratching nearby objects. There are some solutions if your cat continues :\nApply some perfume on the scratching area, preferably vanilla or lavander, to cover the pheromones it left before. Do not use a too strong perfume (like citrus), as it seems cats could urinate on it to cover the smell! Of course, cat repellents work as well, but do not put to much of it!\nCover the area with something that the cat will dislike; a plastic cover, a space blanket or some\ndouble adhesive tape if the area is localized, for example.\nNever ever punish your cat, he will not understand.

I hold the plant and pot with one hand and push down on the bottom of the pot with the other hand.\n\nIf you've done this successfully, the plant should come out of the pot easily! If the plant doesn't budge, you may have a rootbound plant that needs a little more massaging on the sides and bottom of the pot before it comes out.\nP.S. If it's a very large or rootbound plant, don't be afraid to cut it out of its pot, especially if it's in a thin plastic nursery pot.

I'll shake away a little excess soil or sometimes slightly loosen a root ball with my hands if the plant was rootbound, but otherwise I don't worry about them. Their roots will spread easily into new soil.\nThere are really only two times I mess with the roots of foliage plants:\nIf the plant is sick, I'll often remove as much soil as possible from the roots to check for signs of root rot and other problems.\nIf I'm dividing the plant into smaller sections, I also tend to remove as much soil as I can. This allows me to either untangle the roots of the individual sections, or find the right place to cut the root system for division.\nTo remove excess soil from plant roots, I highly recommend soaking the roots and soil in a bowl of room temperature water. (Water that is too hot or cold can hurt the plant, so be careful!) Swish the plant around lightly in the water to help the soil fall away and use your fingers to \"fluff\" the roots in the water to separate them.\n\n(Make sure not to pour the soil-y water down the drain or you'll have a clog!

I always keep a bag each of all-purpose potting soil and cactus soil on hand to use for transplanting. I'll either use one of them or mix them together depending on what I think the plant will like.\nThe pot choice is important too! To learn more about choosing the right pot type and size, read my instructable over choosing the right pot for your plant. :)\nFor example: today I'm transplanting a new aloe I purchased a couple weeks ago. (I like to give plants a little time to get used to my house before putting them through transplanting. Too much change at once can be rough on them!) I've used a four inch terra cotta pot (one inch bigger than the pot it was in), put in plastic mesh to cover the drainage hole, and filled the pot with a cactus soil mix.\n\nWhen transplanting, here are a few tips to avoid problems later:\nFill the bottom of the pot with new soil and nestle the plant into it, adding soil around the edges of the roots and pressing down lightly. Then add soil on top around the plant. Soil should be pressed into the pot so that the plant stands upright and strong.\nDon't fill a pot too full of soil! This can cause a big mess when watering. I normally stop filling no more than 1/4 inch from the top edge of the pot for small pots and 1/2 inch for large pots. The dry soil will settle slightly after it's watered the first time, and you can decide to add more soil after that.\nNever bury a plant too deeply. Burying leaves or new stem growth deeply in soil can sometimes cause rotting. This is especially important with succulents - I always try to keep them slightly above the soil.\nWater thoroughly after transplanting until water runs out the bottom of the pot. If you're transplanting a formerly rootbound plant, check back on it the next day. Sometimes the soil in and around the rootball will dry out before the soil around it, so you'll have to water right where the plant's roots are if it gets droopy.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFH/CD7O/JIAJNAAJ/FFHCD7OJIAJNAAJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Choosing the Right Pot and Soil and Transplanting the Plant"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "It's pretty normal to make a major mess while transplanting, so I always find myself doing a little cleaning up after.\nMy favorite tool for this is a small paintbrush!

They all need to be the same size but they may not be the same dimensions as the ones I have used. Unlike the 3D printed version of the planter where the module unit was a cube (all sides equal length) the three sides of my tetra briks are all different lengths so the pattern they create when laid out is not symetrical. So what I did with the pattern was to tilt the briks in such a way so that they are directly above each other. This way the weight ditribution would still be vertical. Thats all very well but it means the briks on the floor will never be in a straight line. We need to cut them to size. So with some drawing skills in TINKERCAD heres a way you can calculate the truncated base. If you would prefer to skip all this technical precision in the following 2 steps be my guest. You could always just start joining the tetra briks together and then just cut them using the edge of a table as a guide for example.

And then there were truncated spurs in geography class. How cool was that? \"Out of my way!!! Glacier coming through!\"\nAnyway, we need to find out the measurements of the tetra briks as they get cut off (.....truncated) so as to be flush with the floor. And remember these tetra briks at the base will be upside down and filled with polyurethane foam so that they won't collapse under the weight.\nStart by dragging a box out from the right onto the drawing surface and give it the same dimensions as your tetra briks. Remember when you open up the tetra brik on one end it will be slightly bigger than when its closed. We want the measurements when its open, what its going to be for the planter.\nFor demonstration purposes lets say its 10 cms. wide, 24 cms. high and 6 cms. deep. But you are going to have to work off the measurements of YOUR tetra briks.\nDuplicate the brik just once and move it half the width to the right, the full depth to the back and raise it half of its height. In my case that will be 5cms, 6cms and 12cms respectfully.Then select both bricks and duplicate\nNow move these duplicated briks as before but this tme the distance to displace is one full width, double the depth and one full height of the brik (my case: 10 cms,12 cms and 24 cms). You should have 4 bricks lined up in a funny diagonal stepping stairs.\nPHEW!.... WELL DONE..... YOUR DOING GREAT! (I'm talking to myself by the way)\nDuplicate these 4 briks and move them: one full width to the left, half the depth to the front and lift it half its height. Now you should have 8 briks that interlock nicely in a sort of Minecraft/MC Escher mode. We're just going to have to do one more duplication of all the briks and we'll have enough to calculate the truncated base.\nSo, go ahead and duplicate and now move the 8 duplicated briks two and a half widths to the right, one and a half depths to the back. It will look like the thirds picture here. Then drop it down by half its height (fourth pic). Last of all move the brik thats the furthest to the left into the gap you see between the third and fourth row: two full widths to the right, one full depth to the back and drop it down one full height.

Well, they are just a bunch of cubes after all. But now, in 3 different views or planes if you prefer we are going to turn all the briks together.\nClick on the rotating tool and turn all the briks together. By clicking and holding it down drag the curser outside the protactor wheel and you can freely choose the rotating angle. What angle you need will depend on the proportions of your tetra briks but what we want to get is that the corners of the briks of the same color are lined up. Take your time :) when its looking like you've got it where you want it (second pic) switch to LEFT view and do the same.\nBut this time all the corners will be lining up. Third pic here shows the job already done. I could of lined it up vertically but while I was rotating I brought them all down to being horizontal so that it fits better on a computer screen.\nThen change the view back to the TOP and for the final time rotate all the briks so that the corners are aligned. Fourth pic shows the job done. Now we can truncate the bottom briks\nBring out a box hole make it big enough to cover all five briks. Give it plenty of width, depth and height. Line it up with our base briks so they will all be cut in a good position. Too far up and the bottom red briks will get truncated across their top face, too far down and the yellow briks will be cut across their bottom faces. Duplicate the box hole four times and combine each brik with one of the now 5 box holes. And they are truncated! Get rid of all the other briks we don't need them. We still need to measure the lengths of the edges on the truncated bricks.\nUnfortunately, we have to go back the way we came. Back through the 3 different views and straighten out the briks again :( Then finally on the works plane we can place the ruler on the points we need and it gives us the measurements.

Its a lot easier to work in the real world with the actual tetra briks. Having said that you still need to be careful that you line them up correctly. But don't worry too much, your materials are free so if you go wrong at least you haven't wasted any hard earned cash.\nStart lining theTetra Briks up and figuring out where they will be getting glued. Mark out the lines and number them so that you don't get confused. Put the same number on the two faces that will be stuck together and you won't go wrong. Like it often happens with patterns its hard getting started but once you are on the right track its just a question of repeating the steps. I made a simple guide with a piece of paper to mark the areas for gluing. It measures half the height by half the width + half the dept. Fold it to divide the paper into the spaces you need for marking. The only other thing you need to be careful about is the positioning of the cubes at the base and remember they are upside down too.\nI use contact glue a lot. I thought it would be perfect here. You apply it to both surfaces for gluing, let it dry 20 minutes or so and then just press them together firmly and they are stuck. You have a lot of control, no slipping and sliding. But you need to be careful when sticking because it can't be unstuck too easily. So make sure you line it up well. You only get one chance. Do them in small batches. Glue the first few together, then go back and figure out the next few you're going to glue, mark them , number them, apply the glue and wait for it to dry again and stick them. And start another batch.

Use the stapler to tack the center of each side into position. Make sure you get the material tight. Work your way from the center toward the corners, keeping the material tight. Cut slits for the hooks and for the notches that go around the seat hinges. Work slowly, holding the stapler with one hand and whacking it with a mallet in the other hand. If your aim is exceptional, you don't need the mallet, but I found this worked fine. At the corners, make a few slits and staple each strip down tight before trimming off the excess. You can go around the edges later and flatten any staples that didn't go in all the way with a hammer.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTQ/Y0IU/JI4TTVJM/FTQY0IUJI4TTVJM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD9/LF79/JI4TTW1H/FD9LF79JI4TTW1H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6S/QYYC/JI4TTVI9/F6SQYYCJI4TTVI9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5X/82YV/JI4TTVYX/F5X82YVJI4TTVYX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHW/MRI7/JI4TTW2U/FHWMRI7JI4TTW2U.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Cut the Pad Material and Staple the Cover Material"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "That's it, you're done.

Then I turned the bottle while pushing it against the tool until I get a scratch all around the bottle.\nNext step is in the kitchen. You need alcohol, wool, water and ice. The principle is to have a crack developping in the glass from the scratch, due to thermal stress induced by quick temperature change. I wrapped a wool thread soaked in alcohol around the bottle, with a small knot. then I let the wool burn while turnng the bottle, and plunged the bottle in the cold water. Normally you hear and see a crack in the thickness of the bottle. You may need to repeat it until the bottle separates in two.Success is not 100% but around 85%. Something which can lead to failure (meaning not a straight cut) is if the knot abd the wool is too long, and therefore creates a hot area wider, this can lead to have the crack going out of the scratch in this area.\nAt the end of this step, you have some tops and bottoms of bottles.

I had some pieces of chalk board left over from previous projects so I just used one of those. You can either find a chalkboard from a hobby store or even use some of the chalkboard paint available from home improvement stores. If you decide to go that direction, make sure you follow the steps on the can and let the paint cure enough so you don't scratch it while handling it.\nSeeing as how there is no set size to this project, you need to get the basis of your measurements for the pallet wood from your chalkboard material itself.\nWhen cutting the boards, you want to take into account how you will be putting the chalkboard in it. I ran a groove along the sides of my boards to recess the chalkboard inside of it. Depending on your tool set ups, you can also just mount the chalkboard to the back of your pallet wood.\nIn either case, you want to be sure when you cut the pallet wood, you don't short yourself. You can always cut it again if its too long!\nI decided to run 2 vertical boards, with my two horizontal boards in between. For the vertical boards, I found the measurement of the chalkboard and then added the width of both top and bottom horizontal boards.\nFor the horizontal boards I measured the top of my chalkboard.\nI marked the distances out on my boards, deciding which piece I wanted there and then headed over to the saw.\nBe sure to have proper PPE (personal protective equipment) when cutting on the saw such as safety glasses and ear plugs. If you are not comfortable or have not been properly trained on the saw, I suggest finding someone who is that is willing to help you.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRW/TRLH/JI0JK3ND/FRWTRLHJI0JK3ND.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE0/WTMF/JI0JK3NE/FE0WTMFJI0JK3NE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Cut to Length"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Now that your boards are cut down and easier to handle, it is a lot easier to see the shape of your frame coming together.\nIf you put your piece of chalkboard on the frame, you will see that the frame is a bit too big for it. This is where I make my adjustments for how I will be holding the chalkboard.\nSince I will be putting a groove in my boards, I will want to shrink them about 1/2\" . This will allow me to put a 1/4\" groove all the way around on the inside so I can recess the chalkboard into the pallet wood.\nIf you are just going to mount your chalkboard to the back of your frame, you may want to cut your boards a little smaller to give you more \"meat\" to secure your chalkboard to.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGW/BA6J/JI0JK3NK/FGWBA6JJI0JK3NK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Size and Fit for the Chalkboard"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "If you have decided to cut the groove in your board, I find it helpful to mark the side that is to receive the groove.\nLay your frame out again and mark left, right, top and bottom. I also like to put an \"x\" on the board to be sure I am cutting the correct side.\nThen it is time to set up the saw. For this I measured the thickness of my chalkboard and used a stacked dado blade set. I made the set up just a bit thicker than that of my chalkboard so I would not have a hard time getting the chalkboard in to the pallet wood frame. I also set the blade height at around 1/4\" .\nIf you do not have a stacked dado blade set, you can use your single saw blade, just be sure you do not take out too much material. A little loose will be okay, but if the opening is too big the chalkboard may not be sturdy enough and rattle when writing on it.\nI try to take a piece of the same wood (that isn't part of my project) to do my test cut on.

I have used resin in the past, but mostly for making blanks with pens that I make. That resin needs pressure to cure to avoid bubbles and I knew that my boards would not fit so I looked for another option.\nI'm typically try to avoid resin from hobby stores as I do not know how long they have been sitting on the shelf and I didn't want to ruin my project with a bad product.\nThat's when I had found Royal Palm Resin. (available at www.royalpalmresin.com ).This is a 2 part epoxy resin which comes in 2 variations. The original and the thin. What drew me to this brand is that the thin version can be used without a pressure vessel to have it cure bubble free. There are also different sizes of each kind, so if you only have a small project you don't need to be stuck buying a gallon if you don't want it (though after using Royal Palm Resin I am going to start finding reasons to use it more). I had contacted the owner of the company on his facebook page and he was super quick and helpful with answering any questions I had (that's also a bonus to me - I usually have lots of questions and what better way to get the answers than from the person most directly associated with the product!)\nAnother bonus of this resin is that there is virtually NO odor at all. You could mix and pour this in your kitchen if you needed to ( I don't suggest this as it can be a bit messy but you get the point!)\nWhen I got my resin it included detailed instructions on how to mix and use it properly which was great.\nI followed them easy enough and got to mixing (make sure to wear some disposable gloves!)\nI made way more than I had needed but I would rather have that had happen than to not have enough. Luckily I anticipated this and had one of my pen blank molds ready to use in case!\nMake sure to properly mix the resin, getting rid of the \"streaks\" that you can see when they first get poured. When the streaks are gone, and looks perfectly clear, it is properly mixed.\nFor my project I wanted the resin to have a color, so I used a bit of a copper mica powder. These are available at craft stores or other online suppliers.\nOnce that was mixed in, I used to heat gun as suggested to warm the resin (making it more fluid and easier to pour, along with aiding in getting rid of some bubbles)\nOnce the proper consistency was reached it was time to pour!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTC/AQ0A/JI0JK3QM/FTCAQ0AJI0JK3QM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGV/ZBPQ/JI0JK3QQ/FGVZBPQJI0JK3QQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAK/67BA/JI0JK3RJ/FAK67BAJI0JK3RJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKF/CFVS/JI0JK3RM/FKFCFVSJI0JK3RM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2P/RE06/JI0JK3SD/F2PRE06JI0JK3SD.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Mixing the Resin"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "Start filling your voids with the resin.\nAs you can see I'm not exactly the neatest which is why i put the painters tape down!\nThis is also when I had my major fail moment.

Coincidentally, the owner of Royal Palm Resin had contacted me to see how I was doing with my project! Talk about customer service! After some discussion with me, he said that there would be no problems adding another pour of his resin on top of what I had already done, it just needed to be clean of any debris or dirt.\nRenewed in the ability of being able to fix the mess I had created, I went back to my project after 48 hours (allowing for a proper cure). I looked at the backside of the frame and saw that most of my holes had been covered with the cured resin. I took a hot glue gun and filled a few of the pinholes that were left and then made another batch of resin.\nThis time was a success!

Occasionally I would wipe the surface down with denatured alcohol to help remove excess dust from sanding.\nFor the base of the message board, I wanted to keep the rustic look going, so i just used my belt sander to wear down a groove on the board for a piece of chalk.

Succulents and cacti like to be watered like your typical houseplant: deeply and until runoff is achieved.\nThe main difference here is that succulents and cacti like to go much longer in between waterings. A good way to think about this is to consider how they live in their natural environments. Succulents and cacti thrive in rocky, sandy, and dry areas with very little rainfall, so they're used to getting one big drink every once in a while.\nWhile I may water a pothos once a week, a succulent in a comparable size pot may only be watered every 2-3 weeks. However, I also have many tiny succulents in little pots on my windowsills. If the temperature is high and the sun is intense, I can sometimes even water them more than once a week.\nIn winter, you'll want to water even less often. Many cacti and succulents go dormant during the winter due to colder temperatures and shorter days. Even though they're inside, I water mine less.\nIn general good watering for succulents and cacti come down to one major rule: never, ever water until the soil is completely dry.

The inner workings had become badly corroded over the years and there were signs of battery acid leakage.\nThe other main ingredients for this light are an old Ikea 12v wall spot light and a heavy cast desktop microphone stand.

Luckily the paint flaked off really easily as I really didn\u2019t want to scrape it off and risk marking the metal which would mean more cleaning and polishing at a later stage. I rinsed the paint stripper and finished the base with a Scotchbrite pad.\n\nI also stripped out the innards from the bike light which was the battery holder, the bulb and backplate and the switch mechanism. I\u2019d considered re-using the switch but decided it would be too hard as well as a little less practical than a switch part way down the flex, which has the benefit of not having to touch/move the light in order to turn it on and off. I did glue the old switch button back to light casing though.\n\nNext, I freed the MR16 fitting from the Ikea spot light.

I just needed to reduce the diameter at the open end using a bench grinder and a file. It was made of aluminium so this was a fairly quick process.\nMy biggest quandary was deciding how I was going to join the lamp to the stand. I considered a number of options including sliding a metal bar into the mic holder and attaching the lamp to the metal bar. I thought that this would make the lamp too high in the stand as well as look cumbersome and overly complicated. As I had a spare mic stand I thought it was worth seeing if I could manipulate the holder with heat to make it fit the diameter of the lamp. Success, this was a fairly slow process as I didn\u2019t want to risk breaking it or losing the desired shape. You can see how much I was able to manipulate it by comparing it to the spare one I have.\nI felt it needed a bit more to the design of the way the holder attached to the light as well as be more robust, after all this is intended to be a working desk light. I often find that I make use of old bike accessories and components in builds like this (as I did in the petrol tank speaker I made a few years ago), I manage to find this semi-circular fitment that I believe was once part of a chain ring bash guard. The shape was just about the same as the lamp body. I cut this in half and attached a half to each side of the now widened mic holder. I used hex bolts and nylock nuts to attach it to the lamp body. I also added the small pointy ended set screws to the clamp just to add to the industrial look of the lamp.\nI found a suitable (if a little big) rubber grommet that the cable could pass through.

Its not eating.\nAs noted in step 7 the toys kept getting caught on the bottom of the unit and on the polycarbonate sheet that was added to correct the problem. So I would say that even though the concept was neat and the 'monster' looked cute - it did not work well... really, not at all. :-(\nSome lessons learned:\n1. It appears that the sponges need to be longer or more flexible so that if on first contact the toy does not go in the 'sponge' or new flap thingie will flip over it and not jam it into the bottom of the unit. Presently the sponges will pin the toy against the bottom plate or polycarbonate sheet and stop the tongue from spinning.\n2. The drive train needs to be more robust, or at least fine tuned so that is runs smoothly. 3D printed gears work, but may hang occasionally - sometimes here too. They run well, but every so often they hang. That may have to do with how well the wheels are running true on the axial. The wheel mounting is OK, but could be better. If I thought that the 'monster' was going to get excessive use I would probably explore real bearings.\n3. I had fun designing and printing the 'sponge holders'. I got more experience with Fusion 360 and 3D printing in general. They turned out well and did exactly what I intended.\n4. PVC sheet material is nice to work with. I found it at Home Depot for $15 for a 2' x 4' sheet of 1/4\" thick. It allows use of woodworking tools and it glues fast with PVC cement and does not need to be painted. I'll have to use it in some future projects.\n5. Nonslip drawer liners work well on 3D printed wheels. This combination worked surprisingly well. The wheels did not slip on hard floors or carpet. There were easy to put together too.\nSo the concept is nice but probably needs some additional experimentation and redesign to get it functioning correctly. I still had fun making this instructable and learned a few things!

Turn the handle inside out and sew an 1/8\" topstitch around the entire piece. This is the process used on the blue striped binder.\nHowever, for the cherry binder, I loved the fabrics so much and didn't want to waste it, so I bound the tiny strips! The outcome was just darling. To do this, cut two (2) 14\" sections from the ~1.5\" leftover strip. Lay your quilted 14\" strip right side up. Take a 2\" binding strip and fold in half long ways.

The largest ball will be for the base, the main part of the pot. Then there will be a ball, probably about half the size: this will form the arms.

A couple of ways I found to avoid these problems: If it feels as though the clay is getting too warm, place it in the freezer for a few minutes before continuing work. I used this trick a lot to get through this part. Also, if the clay seems too thin, you can either add more of the color, or ball it up and try again. I added more clay at least once, and started over again no less than four times!\nSo to start the body, I took the largest ball, and flattened it out into a circle.\nNext, bringing up the sides--the hardest part in my opinion.\nFirst, I took the edges of the circle a little ways apart, and then smooshed them together. This I repeated over and over again, all the way around, until I had some semblance of a pot.\nThen, to make the sides taller, I placed thumb and forefinger on the inside and outside of the pot, and gently rubbed them together, continuously pulling up.\nI repeated the above steps over and over, until I ended up with a tiny, finished pot that fit my little air plant as hair. I did make the edges at the top close in a few millimeters, and the body have curved edges, but this was to exaggerate the chubby little monster body.\nIn order to smooth out the fingerprints and the nicks, gently and quickly brush the pad of your finger against the surface of the clay until it has the smooth, finished look.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3H/049Q/JHKU1R5G/F3H049QJHKU1R5G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD8/QTGM/JHKU1R5E/FD8QTGMJHKU1R5E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP6/AS2T/JHKU1RO3/FP6AS2TJHKU1RO3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSE/LBII/JHKU1R63/FSELBIIJHKU1R63.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSS/AJD9/JHKU1RNV/FSSAJD9JHKU1RNV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9U/MKLM/JHKU1RNE/F9UMKLMJHKU1RNE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCV/D9VJ/JHKU1RM7/FCVD9VJJHKU1RM7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO5/ATJF/JHKU1RLS/FO5ATJFJHKU1RLS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJD/2DIU/JHKU1RLH/FJD2DIUJHKU1RLH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVP/RH51/JHKU1RLG/FVPRH51JHKU1RLG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Making the Body"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "My little guy really started to come alive here!\nOk, so remember the three balls of clay from the beginning?

I curved it slightly, so it resembles a kidney bean with half flattened. I repeated above for the other arm.\nThis next part is very important! If the arms are not joined well, they will fall off (and probably break) while cooking or air drying.\nTo join the arms to the monster, I first picked which side of him I wanted to be his face. I loosely pressed the flat part of both arms to opposite sides of his head, to make sure I liked how he looked before permanently attaching them. Next, firmly supporting my monster from inside his head, I smoothed and blended the flat part of his arms until they were seamed with his head, leaving the more rounded part unblended--while still attached.

Phew!\nThen, I rolled each ball until they were about the size and shape as a tic-tac, which turned out perfectly for my little monster.\nAttaching the feet was a lot easier than the arms, though. I firmly pressed the two little tic-tac balls of clay, horizontally, onto the monster. This gave his little feet a rounded shape, like a chubby little baby's feet.\nTo further attach the feet, I blended some of the 'heel' into the bottom of the monster pot, where the blending would not be seen.\nIf you like him just like this, without a face or toe pads, skip to step 8.

Then, roll it out into a very thin string/rope, a 'snake' as we call them in my house. ;) It will be about as thin as a toothpick, maybe smaller (depending on how you roll it).\nUsing a toothpick, cut off a miniature little section of the clay.

Roll it into a tiny ball, and flatten it against the table for a miniature toe pad. This you can leave on the table until all parts are completed. Make two more of these pads for his other toes.\nThen, for the larger foot pad, cut off a section of clay (still from the same 'snake'). For the proper proportions, make this length between two and three times as long as the ones for the toes, again flattening it after making a ball.\nFinally, to attach these pads to his feet, press the three smaller and one bigger firmly onto the foot, in the classic arrangement--the big one in the middle, the three smaller arrayed near the top of the big pad.

Otherwise, skip to the next step. Either way, I'm sure, will be absolutely adorable!\nUnfortunately, I don't have very many pictures of this step. You use a lot of the same techniques as from the last step, so it will be very simple. The most important part of making 2D clay objects, especially from balls of clay, is to remember that the area will increase dramatically as it is being flattened onto the monster.\nFor the eyes: Using the same length of clay from before, cut about half a centimeter of clay and roll it into a ball. Flatten it out--this is one eye. Repeat the process for the other eye. If my instructions leave eyes that are too big or too small for your monster, it is as simple as adding or removing clay, and re-rolling the eye balls (hee-hee!) (...sorry) and re-flattening them.\nFor the mouth: Cut a section from the clay length--but don't roll it up into a ball! Instead, roll it around until the ends are flat, not pointed, and it is as long and thin as you want.\nFor the tooth: Optional, but I think it just makes him look cuter ;) I cut a tiny section of white clay, rolled it out into a 'snake' with pointed ends. I cut off one of these pointed ends, and when I flattened it on the table, it turned into a crooked little triangle, perfect for a snaggle tooth on a (baby) monster.\nAttaching: In order to avoid obvious seams, before putting all of the face on the monster, I put the tooth on the back of the mouth. Then, I pressed the eyes onto the monster. They seem really far apart at first, until you add the mouth. The exact structure is above in the picture, but I positioned the mouth almost between the eyes--hence why they were so far apart.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ6/0BMS/JHKU1RH6/FZ60BMSJHKU1RH6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMH/QLK9/JHKU1RG4/FMHQLK9JHKU1RG4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F81/QSR3/JHKU1RCZ/F81QSR3JHKU1RCZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8A/NY25/JHKU1RDN/F8ANY25JHKU1RDN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Making the Face"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Here's where the real difference between bake and air-dry clay comes in.

With the particular type of baking clay I used, it took less than 15 minutes.\nThis step though, is really easy. All that you have to do is follow the instructions on the package of clay. For me, it said to bake the clay at 275' for 15 minutes per 1/4 in of clay.

This instructable, as usual, was born from researching something completely off topic. I think this happens to most of us when we fire up our google membership cards, one link leads to another; and the next thing you know we find ourselves watching drone reviews or kitten video's at 3 in the morning. But I digress, this idea was born from looking up the ratio for making a natural herbicide from salt, vinegar and dish soap. It had a link talking about edibles harvested from your backyard, (and no, not those kind of edibles...) This bounced me around till I found a site talking about dandelion syrup and all things dandelion.\nTurns out, dandelions have numerous benefits, they can be turned into salads, made into wine, heck the heads can be dipped in panko and fried up with some marinara - Yum! There are numerous health benefits as well, ranging from calcium substitutes to liver treatments, but the most important are those that affect the heart. After a long cold winter, dandelions are some of the first flowers to break up the greys left over from winter and the first to melt you frozen heart. (Yes, I have watched Frozen too many times with my little one...)\nSome dandelion fun facts? each flower head is actually hundreds of little flowers called florets. And dandelions are one of the most vital early spring nectar sources for a wide host of pollinators, aka the bees; so pretty important. Did you know, dandelions used to be referred to as the first flowers of love. After all, how many parents have received a bouquet of dandelions from a child looking up at them with delight. How many flower crowns have been made, how many have been given in a impromptu give of love, I'd say quite a few.\nOne thing I found was how many sites say you can't keep dandelions in a vase, they wilt up too fast. Really though, just like any delicate flower they just need the right care at harvest. Dandelions need to be cleanly cut rather then pulled as this action crushes the stem, impeding uptake of water. Additionally they need to be placed in water ASAP! Also, once picked, the stem begins to lose strength. That's why placing them in a test tube works so well, the head rests on the rim of the tube. Now there are many test tube type vases out there, but I wanted something that with a little juxtaposition; test tubes combined with raw wood allow this vase to meld with most decor. From ultra modern to vintage it just works. The Yellow of the dandelion pairs perfectly with the glass and blonde wood, though it works well with other flowers as well.

If you\u2019re a fan of keeping things clean, creative reuse, or both, I hope this Instructable helps you out! These methods are my go-to tricks for removing labels and price stickers and clearing up residue they often leave. I frequently use them on glassware like jars from groceries, but they certainly extend to many other situations \u2013 for example, the first time I used mayonnaise to remove residue was on a bow saw. That trick is my favorite and has worked for me just the same on electronics\u2019 plastic housing as it worked on glass jars, as we\u2019ll soon see. Read on to hear more of how mayonnaise has worked for me. I\u2019ll also include a little science for tho se of you who\u2019d like to know more about how things work.\nSince I most frequently use this on glass jars and bottles, I\u2019ll start with a summary of ideas. Here\u2019s a brief summary of the tricks so you know what\u2019s to come after that:\nMayonnaise (and possibly other emulsions)\nSoaking\nHeat\nSolvents\nAbrasion (i.e. scrubbing)\nFinally, I\u2019ll present two case studies that I\u2019ve done since the inception of writing\nThe real power of these isn\u2019t in the individual methods, but how they can be combined for maximum efficacy, so there will certainly be connections and overlap between these steps!", "title": "The Complete Guide to Label Removal", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Complete-Guide-to-Label-Removal/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Label/sticker removal from new purchases is both the first and foremost application and the most straightforward. After all, when you buy something new and shiny, wouldn\u2019t you rather it be new and shiny everywhere, not new and shiny except for that spot where the label used to be?\nThe other main application I\u2019ve found is in repurposing containers once you\u2019ve emptied them of their original contents, and that\u2019s not just one idea but a whole spectrum of them for which Instructables is the perfect place to explore. Since I like a good solid glass jar, I often save the ones I like for holding things I\u2019ve prepared like hot sauce or salad dressing, or bulk buys that could use a handier container than the large plastic bags I first bought them in.\nFeeling more creative or artistic? Try a glass bottle cutter Instructable, make your own frosted glass, grow a plant, make blue-filtering glasses, build an automatic pet feeder\u2026 the possibilities are nigh endless!", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Why Would These Tricks Help You?"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Mayonnaise has practically been a silver bullet for me \u2013 it almost always does the trick with one or sometimes two applications and little extra effort. The idea is simple \u2013 get as much of the label off as you can, spread a thin layer of mayonnaise across it, wait a while, and then rub the residue off and wash off any mayonnaise that may still be left.\nThe first step is just to get off what you can before putting the mayonnaise to the task. This is because just as with any other method it takes more work to remove a thick layer than a thin one, and the outer layer of paper labels is typically something you can tear most of the way off by hand before bringing in the bigger guns. If the subject of your cleaning can be immersed in water, that\u2019s a good way to loosen up paper labels; if not, try heat from a hair dryer. We\u2019ll return to both of those after more on this method.\nOnce you\u2019ve got most of the label itself off and are down to the residue, spread a layer of mayonnaise over the residue. Then, just wait! I don\u2019t actually know how long you need to wait \u2013 I typically apply it and then either have to leave, need to go to sleep, or just forget about it, so a few hours is definitely enough. It changes from opaque to translucent after a while, and I figure by the time it\u2019s made such a phase transition, it\u2019s probably ready to be scrubbed off.\nFor the removal, I just use a paper towel and scrub. I\u2019m not sure whether or not scrubbing with the part of the paper towel that has the mayonnaise on it matters, but that\u2019s what I usually do since it\u2019s the part that I was already scrubbing with anyway. Usually just one go is enough for me, but if at some point you notice that no more residue is being removed after several good scrubs, simply apply a little more mayonnaise and repeat the process.\nI haven\u2019t tried other emulsions yet since (1) mayonnaise has worked so well for me so far and (2) it\u2019s cheaper and less likely to be eaten by me than the other candidates I have on hand, but I\u2019d like to experiment with others \u2013 possibly in a future Instructable! I\u2019m not actually sure what it is about mayonnaise that works so well, but experimentation could help me zero in on it. The oil and the vinegar are candidates for an explanation; mayonnaise is a convenient vessel simply because it\u2019s a gel not a liquid and hence won\u2019t run off. It could also have something to do with emulsification, which in a nutshell is the mixing of polar molecules like water or vinegar and nonpolar molecules like the triglycerides of culinary oils to mix. This can be done, for example, with amphiphilic (Greek for \u201cboth-loving\u201d) molecules that have both a polar end and a nonpolar end, which is what the lecithin does in mayonnaise. (It\u2019s in egg yolks or alternatively is commonly extracted from soy.) These amphiphilic molecules form bubbles with either polar outside and nonpolar inside or vice versa, et viola, an emulsion. As anyone who uses natural peanut butter without any additives knows, if not refrigerated some peanut oil can separate from the rest of the butter. Peanut butter is another example of an emulsion. Whether it\u2019s the emulsifier, the vinegar, or the oil that disrupts adhesion is something I\u2019m not yet able to say.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2K/5MNH/JHAU2571/F2K5MNHJHAU2571.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Mayonnaise (and Possibly Certain Other Condiments Like It)"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Simply being soaked in water is enough to weaken or loosen some adhesives and labels. Even if a soak doesn\u2019t do the trick alone, it can be a good way to break down the fibers of paper-based labels, making them easy to remove in preparation for mayonnaise application. Any temperature of water helps, but if you use hot water (and it either soaks in quickly enough or stays hot long enough) you can get double the bang for your buck because heat is the next in our list of plans of attack.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPA/03D8/JHATZS5U/FPA03D8JHATZS5U.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Soaking"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Most things destabilize under enough heat \u2013 solids melt into liquids as the chemical bonds holding them together are broken, fuels burn as their molecular bonds are broken and oxygen reacts with the freed atoms, and so on. It\u2019s similar for us, but our label adhesive bonds are generally much weaker and can be overcome with much less heat such as from a hair dryer. That said, even these temperatures can still be too hot to be in comfortable direct or prolonged contact with, so be careful! It can be hard to peel off labels simultaneously with heating them for this reason, so aim carefully or try using some sort of tong or hand covering. So far I\u2019ve been able to get by with just careful aiming and hand placement.\nBe sure to peel quickly before your subject cools back down, or you\u2019ll most likely be back where you started as the adhesive reattaches itself. Adhesives often work through weak interactions known as van der Waals interactions which tend to be reformed as easily as they\u2019re broken because all the interactions involved are relatively weak. By contrast, stronger chemical bonds typically require breakdown and rearrangement of molecules or parts of molecules, which requires more energy in either direction the reaction is taken \u2013 as an example, gasoline doesn\u2019t spontaneously burst into flame but requires a spark or flame to get started, even though the overall reaction gives us a net energy output that we use to drive our vehicles. Breaking carbon dioxide and water apart to form the hydrocarbons that make up gasoline is of course an even more uphill challenge, of course.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWR/MW6Z/JHAU1HA8/FWRMW6ZJHAU1HA8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FME/V466/JHATZT3W/FMEV466JHATZT3W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZL/6X4O/JHATZTD3/FZL6X4OJHATZTD3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Heat"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Though it was mentioned earlier separately under the heading \u201cSoaking\u201d, water is in fact a solvent too \u2013 it\u2019s just a very mild and weak one. Typically, for me, using solvents means using acetone, which is easy to find in paint thinners and nail polish removers. This is something I don\u2019t like to use unless I have to, though, because I don\u2019t want to breathe the fumes and always wear my respirator when I do. (That\u2019s more than is generally necessary, but I really like to be on the safe side.) Sometimes, alcohol can succeed as a middle ground choice, stronger than water but weaker than acetone. In any case, solvents are best used in conjunction with scrubbing, with a simple paper tower at first or with something more abrasive if that doesn\u2019t cut it. What we really want is simply to weaken it so it can be scrubbed away without much trouble; after all, it would take a very powerful solvent, a long time, or both to dissolve the adhesive completely.\nAs the name suggests, solvents work by dissolving things, in our case glues and adhesives. To describe it briefly, the interactions between molecules of the solvent and molecules of the solute (which is the thing we\u2019re trying to dissolve, in this case residue) are stronger than the interactions solute molecules have with one another, making it easier for the solute molecules to dissolve into the solvent than to stay with the rest of the solute. Often this means that solvents are composed of either very polar or very nonpolar molecules, depending on whether you\u2019re trying to dissolve something that is polar or nonpolar, respectively. Acetone is very much in the polar category, as are alcohol and water.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FI8/1OM0/JHATZTMA/FI81OM0JHATZTMA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Solvents"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Finally, we come to abrasion, which really just means any sort of scrubbing. What you use here depends on what you\u2019re working on, as you don\u2019t want to scrub so hard that you damage the actual thing you\u2019re trying to clean! Towels, as I\u2019ve cited before, are the always-safe choice if you don\u2019t need to get into serious scrubbing. If you do, however, you can try kitchen scouring pads, melamine foam (which you may know as magic erasers), or steel wool. The choice is an important one \u2013 one of my rules or maxims is BFAW: Brute Force Always Works\u2026 but not always the way you want it to! That caveat of course points to the fact that if you\u2019re too harsh you risk damaging that which you mean to clean.\nThe only two times I can think of mayonnaise not doing the trick were times that I resorted to abrasion with great success. The first time, I used a combination of mopping with acetone and scrubbing with steel wool to clean outstandingly tough glue off of a glass jar. Steel wool is serious business; glass is the only thing I\u2019ve worked with tough enough to stand up to steel wool without collateral damage. The other time was on my coffee table when part of a magazine somehow became affixed to it. A melamine foam eraser made relatively quick work of it but wore away the finish where I scrubbed.

In colder and drier climates, chances are that you will need to help your house plants out with a little added humidity.

In my experience, no matter how much care and turning and rinsing you provide a humidifier filter, it WILL mold on you and and smell is enough to make me never buy a filtered humidifier in the long run. Plus, recurring filter costs drive up the price.\nMake Sure the Humidifier is the Right Size. Humidifiers are typically categorized by the size of the room they'll be used in, so be sure to double check! It would be useless to buy a desk humidifier and assume it would work in a 300 square foot room.\nEnsure the Humidifier Can Be Easily Cleaned. Shop around for a humidifier without a ton of extra pieces with little nooks and crannies. The trickiest part of cleaning a humidifier can be removing all the scale buildup from the water, so try to go easy on yourself!\nCheck the Noise and Light. If the humidifier will be in a common area or a bedroom, you'll probably want to be able to sit and relax without a constant PPPPPPPPPSSSSSSSSSSSSEEHEHHH sound going on. ;) Many humidifiers also include lights that can not be turned off, but you can also use some black tape to cover it!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5F/C2ER/JHATOORV/F5FC2ERJHATOORV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Obvious Answer: Buy a Humidifier"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Another favorite way to increase humidity in a small area is to create a pebble tray.\nA pebble tray is just what it sounds like: a shallow tray lined with pebbles that a plant pot can set on.

Water is poured over the pebbles until it reaches JUST below the bottom of the pot.\n\nYou don't want the pot in the water, but right on top of it. Placing the pot directly into the water can cause the plant to accept too much water and get sick.\nThe only downside to pebbles trays: you will need to clean them, and often.

Our Isa Browns and California White varieties (like most) are extremely hardy birds. Throughout the winter I would take their temperature by touching their feet. I figured that a cold foot was a sign that the birds were in bad shape.\nThe easiest way to heat the coop is with a light bulb. The birds will sleep fine. The bulb wattage also let's you easily adjust the amount of heat for different coops/temps. I found I heated only when temps dropped below 15deg F or -10deg C\nCoop Design - We built an A-Frame coop and insulated it for winter. See more on Coop Design from one of my first instructables. I built this first A-Frame coop while living in New Orleans. I found it easy to modify mainly with plastic sheathing. No rigid insulation except at the top of the coop. I used a series of hanging plastic strips 3\" thick at the door. Similar principle to the way commercial freezes us heavy hanging plastic.\nHeating - The photo shows my homemade heater... obviously a DIYer. I took an exterior light fixture and added a coffee tin. The tin provided a place to hide electrically connections from the birds. It also served to radiate heat. Typically I used a 40 watt bulb. When temps dropped below zero F or -16 C I switched to a 70 watt. As discussed under the laying section. I found it easy to keep the light on a timer designed for Christmas lights. I just bungee'd it in place along the fence.\nEasier still... you could always opt for buying on a chicken heater and adding a thermostat.

We found it easier to supplement the ladies with scraps from the house.\nSome may find this objectionable but we fed our ladies meat... all kinds of meat. We don't want to give the meat scraps in the coop and during the summer flies will quickly descend on anything left out. They will eat everything from skin (pure fat) to the bone marrow (protein and minerals) to bone itself (calcium).\nAn easier option is to buy any of the treats popular online... see here. Most common on forums are the meal worms.\n2. Diversion- It's important to keep the ladies active. If they are simply sitting around in the coop waiting for the end of winter they will start bullying. There is a natural pecking order but the lower birds tend to get more abuse when the top hens are bored (maybe you've seen this before...) It played out for me most when the chickens were eating. See the design I used for my auto feeder. A piece of PVC is so easy.\n3. Exercise suffered a bit but we made sure to let the ladies out each day. We rigged up a pulley to the door of the coop.
