[{"category": "Play", "description": "Make your own compressed air hand gun with a few off the shelf parts.\nOver the years I've used compressed air to launch many projectiles, from paper and straw rocket launchers to acorn, airsoft, and blow dart guns. Using compressed air as a propellant works great and you can really get some distance if you can release the air quickly enough. Using a sprinkler valve is the best way to achieve this as it releases the air instantly. I first saw the idea of a sprinkler valve as an air release mechanism in Make Magazine and thought it was genius.\nThe way the gun works is there is a air pump that is used to fill a air chamber inside the gun. To release the air and propel the airsoft bullet, you push a switch (which acts as the trigger) which releases the air valve and expels the air instantly.\nIn this version I decided to reduce the air chamber which means less pumps are needed to fill the chamber. I did think that maybe this might reduce the power of the gun but it didn't make a difference all at. Now all you need to do is to pump about 6 times on the air pump to fill the chamber and your ready to shoot. I have been talking to people a lot smarter than me on how to make the gun more powerful. One of the suggestions was to reduce the piston size of the air pump which will allow you to increase the PSI. I'll have to explore this in the next build.\nDisclaimer:\nI'm assuming that anyone thinking of making this is a responsible and intelligent human being. This is a serious weapon and could do some real damage so please use it responsibly.\nLets get making", "title": "Extreme Airsoft Hand Gun V2", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Extreme-Air-Soft-Hand-Gun-V2/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Parts:\nPVC Pipe. 25mm = 1 inch so if you are in the US just use 1 inch equivalents.

This time I wanted to conceal the pump within the gun. To do this I had to seal the pump inside the air chamber. The pump is smaller in diameter than the 25mm PVC tube (and too big for 20mm tube) so you have to do some modifications to the tube to ensure the pump forms an air tight seal in the air chamber.\nSteps:\n1. If you put the pump inside the PVC you will see that the top section of the pump is slightly too big to push the pump all the way through. This is a good thing as you will be modifying the tube to allow the pump to slot into the PVC. Cut a piece of tube slighly longer than the pump.\n2. With a dremel (sanding drum attached) remove some of the plastic in the inside of the tube. You only want to go about 10mm deep and remove just enough so the pumps end fits inside the tube\n3. Next to help secure the pump a little better (it's quite loose inside the pipe) I added some 20mm PVC tubing around the pump. With a cutting wheel on the dremel, cut down the middle. Next cut a couple of pieces off the tube and place them around the pump\n4.

This will slip onto the barb (which is 8mm) and then you can put the 8mm piece and barrel into the end of the 9mm piece.\n3.

The result would be a huge inflatable dodecahedron dice where you can get into.\nMy biggest problem was to get the right foil. I finally found thick, transparant PVC at a local store, that is used to put over a table so it can't get stained.\nThe maximum size was dictated by the size of my heat-seal machine. This machine is for closing bags for in the freezer and has a width of 30 cm (12 inch), so that makes the maximum length of the ribs of the dice 2 x 30 cm = 60 cm (24 inch).\nThis gave me an inflated object of approximately 140 cm.", "title": "Life-size Hamster Ball Dodecahedron", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Life-size-Hamster-Ball-Dodecahedron/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Materials:\nthick PVC table protector foil\nvinyl sticker material\nsome kind of tube or hose\nbig piece of paper or cardboard\nTools:\na machine to heat-seal plastic\nscissors\nruler (or piece of wood or something)\ntape measure\nmarker (sharpy)\nclothes pins or something like that\na vinyl cutter or somewhere where you can use one\na (air matras) pump", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FR7/1BQY/IYYT6DFM/FR71BQYIYYT6DFM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMJ/PAXB/IYYT6DG4/FMJPAXBIYYT6DG4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJN/AXGL/IYYT6DGM/FJNAXGLIYYT6DGM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTQ/447X/IYYT6DJU/FTQ447XIYYT6DJU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: You Will Need"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The dodecahedron was a good design for the heat-sealer I have, even if I would have wanted to make just a ball.\nThis form makes a big ball with relatively short ribs.\nDraw a pentagon on a piece of paper with a maximum rib length of twice the length of your heat-sealer.\nDon't ask me how to draw a pentagon, because I had a lot of trouble with that.

It's easy, just click the \"Vote!\" banner button to the right of the title on this page, and select the vote button next to the category.\nI used Fusion 360 for the modeling and tool path creation, then cut them on my Shapeoko 3. Getting the depth right took a few tries, but now I have things really dialed in. I can now cut 20 bodies out of a single 12 by 12 inch sheet of acrylic, but initially I was only able to get about 10.\nAs you can see, for the counter weights I used pennies because they look cool and are cheaper than bearings.\nI like the acrylic material because it is strong, and has a shiny finish, and even though it takes about 5 hours to cut a full sheet, the finished product is really nice. The main drawback is they can chip when dropped on a hard surface.\nInitially I 3D printed the bearing caps that prevent your fingers from touching and slowing down the bearing on my FlashForge Creator Pro, but the quality wasn't as good as I would like so I bought more acrylic and used the Shapeoko to cut them out which turned out much better.\nTools Used:\nShapeoko 3 - Any CNC Mill will work\nFlashForge Creator Pro - Discontinued use and now make the bearing caps on the CNC\nFusion 360 software for creating the models (You can just use the file I uploaded)\nMatterControl\nRubber Mallet\nNut driver to secure pennies (you could also use a small piece of wooden dowel the right size)\nMaterials needed:\nAcrylic 1/4 inch thick, 12 x 12 inches\n608 ABEC-9 Skateboard bearings\nDouble sided tape (I use: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LT9K06Y/ref=o...)\nSuper glue (I use: https://www.amazon.com/Stuff-Thin-Instant-Glue-HS...)\nDish washer soap (to get the grease out of the bearings)\nDegreaser (to get the grease out of the bearings)\nSpeed Cream oil (I use: https://www.amazon.com/Bones-Speed-Cream-Bearing-...)\nNew Pennies - Note: This use does not constitute defacing money and is legal because no changes are made to the pennies.", "title": "Fidget Spinner From Acrylic", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Fidget-Spinners-From-Acrylic-on-a-CNC/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I modeled the bodies of the spinners using fusion 360 with the idea that I wanted to make a ascetically good looking, sturdy; but not too bulky design. The triangular design let me puzzle the bodies together and let me maximize the amount of spinner bodies I could get out of a 1'x1' sheet of acrylic.\nI tape the material down to the wasteboard using double sided tape I bought on Amazon. It works great for everything I have tried but gums up the bit a little, not enough to cause cutting problems though. Sometimes it gets rubbed on the outside of the cut and needs to be cleaned off with a towel or microfiber cloth though.\nI used a fairly large .25\" end-mill so it would be able to move greater amounts of material in the pockets in a shorter period of time. This was especially helpful due to the fact that acrylic is extremely tough to cut with a CNC mill (I have not cut aluminum yet but I expect this will experience will help). I had to whittle away at the material .015\" depth at a time at 20 inches per minute because when I tried to go any deeper, the machine's Z-axis belt would skip and ruin the cut. Cutting over the material again shaves enough off the center hole and pockets so that the bearings and pennies don't fit snugly and need to be glued.

I also got some older ones to go under the brand new pennies. you'll want the older pennies to be within about ten years to keep proper weight and balance (the newer ones weigh about 2 grams while the older ones weigh about 3).\nAfter you have your pennies ready, set the older ones in by hand, then use something with a flat head that you can hit with the mallet to push them the rest of the way down into the pocket. I used a nut driver and rubber mallet, but a piece of dowel would work good as well. A light tap will do, hitting it too hard could crack the plastic! After the old pennies are in on the bottom layer you should be able to push the new top pennies in by hand, I pointed the tip of the shield towards the middle to make it symmetric all around.\nTo make sure the pennies wont fall out when someone drops it, I slammed it (not too hard!!) on a piece of cardboard. If no pennies fall out after 2-3 tries the they are secure, but if a couple do fall out then you can put a drop of superglue on the bottom penny, be careful only to use a little drop. I have glued my finger to many spinners and sanding it off is a pain, and ruins the shiny finish.\nIf you want, you can sand the whole thing with a fine grit sand paper like 1500 or 1100 to give it a nice matte finish as long as you do it in random patterns.\nAfter gluing, pop a clean bearing in an make sure it spins well, then put the caps on. Sometimes they need a little help since they are a snug fit for the bearings we purchased. If the bearing is too loose you can just take a small strip of scotch tape and put it around one side of the bearing and it should fit properly after that.

The 3 bearing spinners were too big for my hands, so I started designing 4 bearing spinners and this is when I started to use pennies instead of bearings for counterweights because my skateboard no longer had any bearings left to use, and I needed more.\nCutting Acrylic was another challenge, as I mentioned before. Initially the travel speed and RPM of the router melted the acrylic and caused it to gum up the bit, but with some research I got the steps and found that the lowest 10k RPM speed works great. It also had problems with the Z axis stalling out and not going deep enough until I changed the depth to .015 of an inch. The toolpath is setup in the files that are attached have a good speed and depth per cut. It takes about 5 hours to cut a full one, but I have been through multiple sheets with no errors.\nIn my first runs I didn't get the depth right and had some problems with that, but having a flat bed, and getting the bit have a piece of paper pass under it got it dialed in just right.

It's time to step up your gaming.\nContinuing from the last Instructable where we made a gaming table, we're now going to make some terrain tiles to match! Continuing the spirit of keeping it modular, we're going to make a variety of tiles that can work together in many many configurations. Since our gaming table is 6 ft x 4 ft, we're going to make our tiles 2 ft x 2 ft. This allows you to use them with a variety of table sizes (4x4, 6x4, 8x4...)\nIn this Instructable, we're going to cover four main ideas of making terrain. We'll make mountains, craters, give texture to the surface, and the paint everything. We'll be using 1 in thick blue foam, which you can find at the hardware store. I found big sheets that were 2 ft x 8 ft, and was able to get the store to cut 2 ft x 2 ft squares for me. Check that they are actually 2 ft x 2 ft, even a slight amount (1/8 in) too big can make them fit too tightly into your table. Once I had the foam as my base, I was ready to go.\nLets get started!", "title": "Modular Tabletop Terrain Boards", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Modular-Tabletop-Terrain-Boards/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Planning\nWe'll start with the biggest mountains. The idea here is to create four tiles that can be rearranged to give you different mountain configurations. In order for this to work smoothly, you need to measure where the corners of each mountain ledge will end, so they line up no matter how you arrange them. For my mountains, I wanted them to cover a quarter of the tile, so they started at 12 in. I then decided how big I wanted the top layer to be, which was 12 in diameter (compared to the 24 in bottom layer). That means that each side has to be 6 in. Then, the middle row of the mountain was 9 in, to make sure that the steps were even. If you want to make a taller mountain, you can add more layers!\nCutting\nIt's easiest to cut the mountain corners out of a corner of foam, to ensure that you have a good 90 degree edge. This means you may have to buy a lot of a foam squares, and only use the corners, which can waste the middles. If you want to cut your own corners, I would suggest cutting slightly under 90 degrees, rather than slightly over. We can fill in the gaps later.\nOnce you have your marks on the edges (6 in, 9 in, 12in) hold your knife vertically and cut a jagged shape across to create a rough outline for your rocks. Cut in a rough quarter circle shape, the exact shapes and positions don't matter, the only thing that matters is that the edges line up with your measured marks.\nMatching\nWhen all your pieces are cut, line up the pieces to make a trio of bottom, middle, and top. Depending how you cut the edges, some pieces may look better together than others. I marked my layers with 1, 1A, 1B, 1C, 2, 2A, 2B... so that I knew which tiles (1) matched to each layer (ABC). Once you start pairing the pieces up, you can make adjustment cuts on the jagged edges so that the layers look good together. The thing I focused on was ensuring that the mountain layers were wide enough for big models to sit on.\nWith these layers done, it's time to add details! Next we will add a rockier texture.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F4E/1F3L/IZQA5IVE/F4E1F3LIZQA5IVE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQP/3RJJ/IZQA5IVJ/FQP3RJJIZQA5IVJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9R/GFRL/IZQA5IVH/F9RGFRLIZQA5IVH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKL/Q75G/IZQA5IVK/FKLQ75GIZQA5IVK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Plan Out the 4 Mountains"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The mountains are roughly shaped, now we will add some rock texture to make them even better! Here you have two choices. You can either use a gap filler, and make smooth mountains, or you can carve in rock textures and keep the edges as a stepped appearance. I know that a smooth mountain is more realistic, but a smooth mountain is very annoying to balance models on. If you want to make smooth mountains, we will cover how to in the \"Sealing Gaps\" step (step 6).\nRock Texture\nTo carve a rock texture, you need to cut angles on the edges of the foam. Make sure to cut on the top and bottom of the foam. Cut at a variety of angles and depths to make the rocks looks more realistic (Picture #2). Take care when cutting the corners, the rocks need to blend into the other mountain pieces. Since you're going to be rearranging the mountains, don't try to make a perfect blend between corners, just ensure that they look decent together. Picture #3 shows how much of a difference carving the rock texture in makes!\nOnce all your mountain layers are carved, set them aside for texturing and painting. I glued mine together, and that made it more difficult to paint. You can use toothpicks to hold them together for texturing, which will allow you to see how the final product will look.\nSingle Mountain\nOnce you've made a few layers of mountains, you can make a different mountain to sit on a single tile, rather then a mountain that crosses multiple tiles (Picture #4). Follow the same steps as you did to make the mountain layers, except this time you don't have a 90 degree corner to deal with. You can also cut a standing rock shape to put on the top of the mountain, or to scatter around the tiles! To make the standing rock, cut a rough shape out of foam and cut rock texture in.\nNext we will cover how to carve some craters!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZM/2YYD/IZQA5IVL/FZM2YYDIZQA5IVL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F29/X5XQ/IZQA5IVP/F29X5XQIZQA5IVP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2L/Z0ZS/IZQA5IVR/F2LZ0ZSIZQA5IVR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOK/E326/IZQA5IW9/FOKE326IZQA5IW9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Carve Rock Texture"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Craters are good to add different heights to your board. We're going to make two types of craters. One to sit above your tile, and one to dig into it. Making both are very similar.\nShaping\nTo make a crater, start by cutting out a rough circle on an angle (Picture #1). Don't cut too deep, or you'll pierce through the bottom of the foam! Next, cut a cross hatch pattern of approx 1/2 in to loosen the foam (Picture #2). Now, you can either use a spoon to scoop the foam out, or continue with a knife. This is a very messy process, the foam bits will fly all over the place. Use the tool to shape the crater how you want, then smooth the surface with sand paper or scotch brite (Pictures #3-5). You can also put some texture in the bottom of the crater using sand. See Step #5 for how to add texture.\nRock Texture\nOnce you have a crater scooped out, you can add rock texture around it the same way you did on the mountains. With an above ground crater, its easy, just cut a jagged shape around the crater (Picture #5), then carve the rock texture in (Picture #6). For a crater in the ground, I cut lots of small rocks out of spare foam pieces and glued them all over (Picture #8). This was a pain to paint, so I don't recommend it.\nIf you accidentally scrape too deep, and break through the bottom of the foam, no worries! On the above ground crater, you can ignore it if you are gluing it to a terrain tile. If you are leaving it free to place in different places around the board, you can put a thin piece of plastic card or card board to fill the hole. Or, if you got a hole in your terrain tile, you can use hot glue to fill in the hole. Once its all painted, you won't be able to tell where the gap is.\nCraters are quick to make, you can carve an above ground crater in ~10 min. Inside a tile is a bit harder, and also depends how big you make it.\nNow that we have all our mountains and craters, we can add more textures.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2B/78V2/J0X4X3EN/F2B78V2J0X4X3EN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCF/TEU9/J0X4X3EO/FCFTEU9J0X4X3EO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7V/ZRYT/J0X4X3EP/F7VZRYTJ0X4X3EP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEV/MRQO/J0X4X3EK/FEVMRQOJ0X4X3EK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP5/MEHO/J0X4X3EL/FP5MEHOJ0X4X3EL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTU/ALXI/J0X4X3EM/FTUALXIJ0X4X3EM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMC/TD0F/IZQA5IW6/FMCTD0FIZQA5IW6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F01/RPSV/IZQA5IW2/F01RPSVIZQA5IW2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Carve Craters"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "To texture your pieces, we're going to use a mix of white craft glue and water. This is a very similar process to adding sand to your miniatures bases, just at a larger scale. Mix the glue and water at a ratio of roughly 80:20 (glue:water). The water helps the glue flow around the tile better, and also makes it easier to apply with a paint brush. Careful though, if you use too much water it weakens the glue and the sand will fall off. Mix the glue in small amounts with a few drops of water at a time in a small plastic container.\nSand Choice\nFor sand, I found some pouches of decorative sand at the dollar store. You can use outdoor sand as well, ensure that it is completely dry before you use it. If you're using outdoor sand, you should sift it to ensure the pieces are the correct sizes (you don't want big chunks throwing off the scale of your board!). I would advise against using bigger pieces (like small rocks), as it makes painting the boards more difficult. I tried to use small aquarium rocks from the pet store blended in with the sand, but most of them fell off while painting (or got stuck in the roller and scratched the surface...).\nTexturing\nOnce you have your sand and glue mixture ready, use an old paintbrush to draw shapes on your foam. Try to avoid painting shapes near the edge of the tiles, it will look funny unless the tile beside it matches the shape. Since the tiles are always going to be moving, you can't count on that!\nYou can paint on a full tiles worth of glue, and then sprinkle sand onto the tile. Work on one tile at a time, otherwise the glue will dry before you get the sand on! You can sprinkle more or less in various places to get different textures. Once you've covered the tile, tip it over to get all the loose sand off to use for the next tile! When all the pieces are textured, you're ready for painting.\nFlat Tiles\nWhile you're texturing, you can make some plain terrain tiles (no mountains or craters). These are good so that you have space to put different pieces of terrain on. They are very quick too make, just paint texture on a 2 ft x 2 ft tile.\nBefore we get to painting, we're going to cover how to seal any gaps that may be left.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZR/SJ89/J0X4X7LG/FZRSJ89J0X4X7LG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZB/KSQS/IZQA5IWA/FZBKSQSIZQA5IWA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0X/J12Q/IZQA5IWI/F0XJ12QIZQA5IWI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Add Texture"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "In this step we're going to work on sealing gaps in the foam. The main gaps I had to seal were the corners of the mountains, since the pieces of foam were not exactly 90 degrees. I used drywall filler, with multiple coats. If you try to do one thick coat, the filler will take ages to dry, or the center may never dry and leave a soggy core. Check the filler you use to see the maximum thickness it recommends applying per layer.\nTools\nTo spread the filler, I first tried a plastic lid cut in half, and was scooping the filler with an old toothbrush. However, I found that a corner of foam works much better (Picture #3 and #4). Who needs fancy tools!\nApplication\nScoop the filler out, and spread it along the corners of the mountains (Picture #5). If you're doing multiple coats, ensure the previous coats have dried solid before starting the next. You can use the foam to make a smooth surface, or wait until the final coat is done and sand it flat.\nSmooth Mountains\nIf you would like to smooth out your mountains, rather than leaving them as steps, I would recommend putting in a different material first, rather than trying to use pure drywall filler. You can cut foam to fit in the corners of the mountains, and then put filler over top to make a smooth curve. If you try to smooth it with pure filler, then you will have to do many many layers to ensure that you're not leaving too much to dry at once.\nYou can also use drywall filler to smooth out any other gaps or surfaces on your other terrain pieces.

Sometimes the melted, bubbly look of the dissolved foam can be an awesome texture.\nBase Coating\nIf you want to protect your foam from spray paint, you can do a base coat with latex paint. This will allow the spray paint to sit on top of the latex, and not react with the foam. You can also use acrylic paints from the craft store (or dollar store). If you've been leaving all your foam pieces separate, it is fastest to base coat everything with a roller (Picture #1). This way it only takes a few min per tile. Once you've rolled everything you can, use a brush to touch up the last areas (Picture #3). Don't forget to paint the edges of the tiles too! I left painting the edges till the very end, that's why most of the pictures have blue edges (Picture #4). Painting the edges is easy if you do 2 at a time, and leave it to dry. This allows you to rotate the tiles without fear of getting wet paint on the floor. You can use newspaper to make a clear area for painting, I also used a big sheet of MDF from the gaming table to protect the floor.\nDry Brushing\nOnce everything is base coated, you can begin the detail work. Dry brushing is the fastest way to make the terrain pop, it really takes advantage of the textures that you've put down. Another option is to lightly dust colours on with spray paint. I wanted my terrain to look ashey, so I went with a black base coat, a grey dry brush, followed by a white dry brush.\nTo dry bush, get a small amount of paint on your brush. Wipe the brush on a paper towel, to press the paint into the bristles, as well as wiping most of the paint off. When there is a small amount of paint left on the brush, lightly paint over your textured areas. The small amount of paint on the brush will catch on the raised areas, leaving the lower levels untouched. This is a fast way to get highlighting done. Pro Tip: Dry brush in a circular motion, if you do a linear motion (up down side to side) it looks really obvious and leaves streak marks. Circular moves looks more natural.\nOnce your grey is complete, you're ready to dry brush the next layer (Picture #5)! Don't dry brush the entire textured parts, leave some parts grey so you have a variety of colours (or in this case, shades) showing. This makes it looks a bit more realistic. Picture #6 shows the slight difference between a grey dry brush and a white dry brush.\nYou should dry brush the edges of the rock texture as well. Use the same technique, and focus on the edges and corners so it looks like the rocks are lighter where light hits them. Use the white dry brush a bit heavier on the very corners to make it really pop.\nFinal Assembly\nIt's easiest to leave your mountains and craters separate to make painting easier. Now that painting is done, you can glue everything to your tiles using the same white craft glue. You should also use some pins to hold everything together. The pins can be toothpicks, or paperclips cut short and straightened. Once your pins are in, spread lots of white glue around the bottom of your mountains (get right to the edges!) and press them to the top of the tile. Put some weight on top to hold it together while it dries. You can also put some dots of hot glue in as well to hold it in place for the white glue to dry.\nNow you're done!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FW5/TDRI/IZQA5IWD/FW5TDRIIZQA5IWD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLL/S0IH/IZQA5IWH/FLLS0IHIZQA5IWH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTL/JTJV/IZQA5IWM/FTLJTJVIZQA5IWM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZF/VY2J/J08EHZSM/FZFVY2JJ08EHZSM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVY/ATPL/IZQA5IWN/FVYATPLIZQA5IWN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F20/Y8SW/IZQA5IXD/F20Y8SWIZQA5IXD.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Painting"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "In this Instructable we learned to make terrain tiles that can be pieced together in many different ways to create a variety of battlefields for your war games!

His puzzle was extremely simple - a popsicle stick with a loop of twine attached on one end. He looped the puzzle to a buttonhole on my jacket. It looked SO simple to me; but after 5 minutes I was ready to grab a pair of scissors. I eventually figured out how to get the thing off my jacket. Needless to say, I felt pretty dumb for taking so long.\nI built a few of my own and have tried them on multiple people (my hapless family.) The solution is not intuitive and my solution time wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought\u2026I AM trying to make myself feel better. Anyway, the puzzle can be made more challenging by placement.

They're also generally made of a bendy, durable kind of plastic that can be easily shaped with ordinary woodworking tools.\nRegarding dimensions, I've found that for medium sized hands a spinner of 80 mm in length works well (third picture).

I also drilled (third picture) guide holes of 2 mm in the centre of the circles for the bearing and nuts, for when the spade bit is used later on. You can use a punch (fourth picture) to help drill the guide holes accurately.\nBefore gluing the two halves together, I roughened the inside faces with sandpaper for the glue to stick to. I also drilled four 5 mm holes opposite each other halfway through each half (sixth picture), hoping they'd form a kind of concealed rivet when filled with glue to help keep the bond intact.\nIn the third picture from the right the bonded piece of plastic can be seen.

The light grey connectors should also be kept straight, so they can assist in the lifting of the balls of the machine.\nAfter inserting the jigsaw, you'll link up the top and bottom crank with a driveshaft. You can use other methods to link up these two cranks, such as a geartrain or chain (an example of the geartrain method is in the last picture). I just like the drivehaft method since there's less friction and it's easy to extend. If you're making your lift taller, be sure to connect more than the top and bottom cranks to the driveshaft (you'll probably want to connect to the driveshaft every 2 red rods). As stated in the first step, you can use only red gears if you don't have any yellow ones. Go to picture 20 for how to use red gears only.\nImportant: After building the linkage of your choice, you'll have to adjust the cranks that are linked up. To do this, slowly turn the jigsaw from the bottom crank by hand (turn it in the direction that it will be moving when finished, not backwards), and make sure the jigsaw runs smoothly all the way around. You especially want to watch out for when the jigsaw reaches its highest point and starts lowering.

It can give distance traveled and the time duration of the exercise session. (See the small numbers across the bottom of the Schwinn display. According to the reading, I have been exercising for 2 minutes and 56 seconds at the time this photo was taken. (This monitor does display both time and speed. An official NordicTrack montior like the one shown in the Introduction shows only one or the other at any one time.) The time duration of the last workout session is held in memory and should be deleted before the start of a new session. See the Schwinn instruction sheet linked in the last step on how to bring up the duration of the workout and how to zero out the reading from the previous session.)\nAs regards pulse, there are work-arounds. First, the heart rate tool for a NordicTrack monitor involves a spring clip on the user's ear lobe. I have tried one, and it was not very accurate. In addition, I believe the user is supposed to stop exercising for part of a minute while the monitor acquires a reading.\nThe dependable low-tech. way is to release the cords from your hands for a few moments, put a finger or two on the big vein in your neck and count your heartbeats for 10 seconds. Then multiply by six for beats per minute. Nurses check pulses all of the time with fingers on a pulse point and a 10 second count. The time display on the Schwinn cyclometer reads out continuous seconds, but you will need to keep your feet moving on the NordicTrack skis or the display will freeze after about 5 seconds.\nMany people wear an electronic fitness tracker on their wrist, and these often include a heart rate monitor. The method of reading your heart rate employed is to turn a bright LED \"on\" and a camera lens reads fluctuations in translucence of the blood flow under your skin associated with surges of blood from a heartbeat. Most of these fitness trackers do not give a continuous readout because the bright LED light would deplete the battery very quickly. Some take a reading at intervals, and uploading data to the companion app. would show a graph for your pulse during the duration of your workout. Customer reviews on various trackers both praise and condemn the same model on accuracy, no matter whose brand name is on it. Some customers complain that their tracker quit working after only a few months.\nI found Instant Heart Rate by Argus with Azumio in the App. Store and have it on my smart phone. It is free and uses the same LED technology characteristic of the now popular fitness trackers worn on the wrist. It gives a quite accurate count. See the second photo. It shows a collage of a phone mount I made. It helps me to avoid dropping my smart phone while using the heart rate app. Lightly place your index finger over your phone's light and camera lens. The reading requires ten or fifteen seconds before it is complete and is a snapshot, not a continuous reading. It is fairly easy to hold an index finger over the phone's camera while exercising without too much bouncing around. After a few readings with any of the above methods you will know what your breathing is like in your target heart rate zone and can use it as a general guide. Check again periodically. As your condition improves, your processing of oxygen becomes more efficient and the correlation between breathing and heart rate can shift.\nThe most reliable heart rate monitors involve a sensor on a chest strap. The sensor sends data to a receiver wirelessly. The readout is usually continuous. Some fitness trackers offer a chest strap as an add-on.\nAt the very best, calories burned per hour as reported by the NordicTrack computer is only a reasonable guess. The amount of effort expended is also a factor. At this site, you find this information: The Nordic Track ski machine can help you to burn calories and get in shape. According to Calorie Lab, a 150-pound person on a Nordic Track Ski Machine will burn 415 calories per hour for light effort, 496 calories per hour for moderate effort and 571 calories per hour for hard effort. If you weigh more, calorie expenditure will be somewhat greater. If you seek out more information like this, you may not find information related to a ski machine, but try searching for cross-country skiing. This site has a calculator into which you enter personal data, and it gives you a calorie count per hour. Fitness trackers worn on the wrist use your heart rate to calculate calories burned based on personal data you enter in the corresponding app. on your phone..\nIf you are familiar with Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper's aerobics program, you can get a table of exercise point values for cross-country skiing here. (Scroll to page 18 of 21.) A reasonably fit person gets a minimum of 30 points per week. 20 minutes of cross-country skiing is worth 6 points. 30 minutes is worth 9 points. Some of Cooper's charts will mention a ski machine, but this fairly comprehensive chart does not, so cross-country skiing is the closest applicable category. Unfortunately, this chart also does not distinguish for different levels of effort.\nIf you have a NordicTrack monitor and need to replace it or if you do not have a monitor and want one, you can use newer technology in a recently manufactured device for very little money. One thing I really appreciate about this skier monitor is that its response to speed changes is much quicker than the official NordicTrack monitor. I also find trying to keep my speed within a certain narrow range keeps me focused on the Schwinn monitor so that time passes quickly and I do not have time to become bored.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKS/NCG3/J048CMH0/FKSNCG3J048CMH0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYK/GRHD/J7AQUX89/FYKGRHDJ7AQUX89.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Other Data"}], "channel": "Sports"}, {"category": "Play", "description": "The inspiration for this project was the desire to build a chessboard that could operate both vertically and on a tabletop. My brother enjoys playing correspondence chess, so I thought he'd like a vertical, wall-mounted chessboard so he could play slow games like correspondence chess with me, his roommates, or visitors to his house. Often, though, if we have a game going on when we meet up, he suggests setting up our current layout on a conventional board and playing through. This inspired me to make a vertical board that could easily be converted for tabletop play mid-game.\nTo accomplish this, the board is simply lifted off a wall and laid flat. The pieces fall over, but remain on their spaces. The shelf assembly is removed and placed underneath the board to get it out of the way and give the board a bit of height off the table. Pieces need to be set upright, but other than that, they are in the same places as before and the game can proceed on a table.\nAlthough I'm pleased with the outcome, I have plenty of suggestions for things I'd do differently, which I'll mention as they come up.\nThis took me ~ 30 hours of hands-on work because I didn't know what I was doing. It could probably be done in 20 or less if I were following this guide. I'd rate it as moderate difficulty because pieces need to fit together and it requires some precision for drilling and staining.

I measured with my ruler, marked the wood, and laid the grid out with tape. I applied dark stain and let it absorb, then wiped off the excess with a rag and repeated several times. Once dry, I peeled off the tape and repeated for the squares which were covered by the tape. Once I had my dark squares, I applied a light stain so that the light squares wouldn't look like raw unfinished wood.\nI was surprised by how light the dark stain was. Ultimately, it didn't matter too much. I think it looks alright. Still, this was a lesson in the complexities of staining. The final color depends heavily on how absorbent the wood is and what kind of stains are used. You can apply it heavier, but it will bleed under the tape. You may want to find a different guide for making a great chessboard if you're looking for a professional look. Look up tips, consult reddit.com/r/finishing or use test pieces if you want to get a better result than mine.\nOnce both stains were applied, I covered the whole board -- besides the borders I was going to paint -- in several coats of urethane finish.

This is a guide to all the elements in Citadel, for those who are looking to add elements in their machine and want instructions. Each element has its own step. Most of these elements are pretty small and compact, as I couldn't use any huge elements in such a compact machine. There are also lots of elements that fit well into red rod towers, so you won't have to have blank towers in your machine. If you'd like to see the video that these elements are in, click here for the Citadel video.\nBefore you begin: Some of the pictures used in this guide are from Citadel V2. I built onto Citadel after making the official video so I could make the elements and tracks work more reliably. For more information on Citadel V2, here are some links to pictures/video:\nOverview video\nCitadel V2 Photos\nCitadel V2 Construction\nCitadel Deconstruction\n_______________________________________________\nNote: Throughout this Instructable there are some elements that are more step-by-step than others, as I don't have the time to rebuild all of them. So, I decided to build the more complex ones that require some explanation. You'll also notice that I've put a lot of the picture info in image notes, rather than in a numbered list like I used to. This is so you won't have to leave the full-screen picture mode, read an image's description, and open the next one into full screen. If you're having trouble with a certain element because there aren't enough pictures, leave a comment and I'll rebuild it and make better pictures.\nThese have not been tested with newer Knex balls, since I use the original balls from Big Ball Factory. You'll have to use your own judgement if you use newer balls, which are slightly larger and lighter than the older ones. Also, lots of the elements have cheap support structures that are meant to be improved (go to Step 21 for an example of these cheap supports).\nLet's get building!", "title": "Citadel Knex Ball Machine Elements - Instructions", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Citadel-Knex-Ball-Machine-Elements-Instructions/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Video link\nThis maze is like a horizontal maze and vertical maze combined, as you can curve it however you like.

It's easy to fit into a red rod tower, but make sure it's reinforced so it'll be nice and strong like in the pictures. Also make sure to either include a floor at the bottom or tracks on all sides.

The most difficult part of this element is the top, as you don't want the ball falling out or going to the other helix. If it does go on either helix, you'll need two tracks at the bottom to catch the ball. I got mine to work on just one helix so mine only has one exit track.

It uses 2 chains as well, and the ball transfers from one chain to the other as it descends. The chains are hooked up to a small escapement mechanism, which makes the chains not go down too fast, while still allowing the ball to easily go down. The tricky part of this element is making sure the chains don't go to the side and get stuck. I added some guardrails along some parts to prevent this, as seen in the last two pictures. I wouldn't advise making it taller, as that will just allow the chain to be more loose. If yours still doesn't work with guardrails, make it shorter.\nImportant: If you make yours a different height than the one in these instructions, the spacing of the red connectors on the chain may be different.

It's one of my favorite games, and since the theme of catwalks and factory was inspired from Portal 2, I decided I wanted some portals in there as well. It may come of surprise, but the pieces aren't actually made of moon rock. A second ball waits behind a wall, and when the first ball activates a small arm it releases this second ball at the right time to make it look like a real portal. You'll have to cut tubing if you want the orange and blue portals, but it looks cool and like the real thing. I made my portals where they are so you can't see what's behind them as easily, like the tracks leading into the back where the second ball is stored. I recommend making a wall so you can't see the second ball.\nThe version covered in these instructions has the same spacing as the one in Citadel.

Standard ball collectors release the balls at the same time, but this one adds a timed release once they're collected. The balls pile up behind a gate, and when the last ball comes in it goes past the waiting line, using an overflow track much like the ones at the bottom of the machine. It then ends up activating the release gate, which sends the rest of the balls into the exit. This gate is a double gate, much like the one that's motorized before the 4-way path separator for the lower side of the machine. The timing depends on how long you make the track that connects the release gate to the arm. You can make it collect as many balls as you want, and you can also modify the timing by changing the length of the connecting track.\nI built two versions in Citadel, one before the vortex that collects 5 balls and one before the yellow zigzag to collect 4 balls. These work best if the last ball is coming in straight on. The smaller one I built had to be more compact, so the balls came in from the side, and sometimes the last ball didn't go into the overflow track. That's why I recommend making the version where the ball comes in straight on from the back (this version worked 100% for me).

To get the best results, you need to have the grenade bounce up into the air one way or another. If you throw it against a wall it will begin spinning but get interrupted by the second impact when it hits the ground a second or two later. It will still throw out decent coverage. But for best results it should be thrown up high so when it comes down, it bounces back up allowing it to spin and empty all of it's paint while in mid air. I use these mainly for room clearing in paintball games.\nFor example, you and an enemy are in adjacent rooms in a building. Neither of you wanting to go through the door first so it turns into a stalemate where you both just sit tight watching the door for the other. That's where these grenades have been crazy effective. If you have a teammate with you, have them cover the door so you can lower your gun and pull out a grenade. Press down on the PVC cap and pull the pin out. Then throw grenade around the corner at a downward angle (imagine an NFL player spiking the football after a touchdown) into the room. This will cause the grenade to bounce back up high enough to dump all of the paint 360 degrees into the room and take out anyone in there.\nAnother example is to lob it high so it comes down behind a bunker in the woods and bounces that way as well. If you throw it like a baseball it will be less effective when it bounces off a wall or tree and gets interrupted by the secondary impact while it's still trying to spin.\nMessage me if you have any questions.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 6: Testing"}], "channel": "Paintball"}, {"category": "Play", "description": "Hi All,\nI wanted to introduce liquid density concept for my son and have fun\nI am going to share how to build Ocean in a bottle and Oil Timer, using everyday items, found at home\nKids can do this by themselves with little Adult supervision and have fun", "title": "Fun With Liquids for Kids", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Fun-With-Liquids-for-Kids/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Material Needed\n2 Plastic bottles ( small sized, cola bottles)\n1 Straw or thin pipe\nSuper glue\nWater ( Distilled water prefered )\nBlue Water color\nVegetable oil\nHow to make ?\nSuper glue two bottle caps and puncture/drill holes large enough for the pipe to pass\nThe pipes must fit tight, if you feel they are loose use can use super glue to hold them\nThe pipe height is adjusted as per the image ( It should not be at same height, keep 0.5 inch gap)\nAdd water to one of the bottles and add (water based) blue color in it, till you are happy with the shade\nClose the cap while applying super glue\nFIll Oil into another bottle, till the rim edge\nNow with a swift action invert the bottle with water and close the cap\nVideo\nLink may not work on app", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXU/GDUL/IYOQMPBS/FXUGDULIYOQMPBS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3S/KGF6/IYOQMPCR/F3SKGF6IYOQMPCR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYF/T2J6/IYOQMPDP/FYFT2J6IYOQMPDP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F13/6NER/IYOQMPEN/F136NERIYOQMPEN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Oil Timer"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Material Needed\n1 Plastic bottles\nSuper glue\nWater ( Distilled water prefered )\nBlue Water color\nVegetable oil\nHow to make ?\nAdd water to the bottle ( half filled)\nAdd blue color till you are happy with shade\nAdd Oil till the rim edge, removing as much as air\nSuper glue the bottle cap to the bottle while closing\nVideo\nLink may not work on app", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F76/7M1B/IYOQMPFN/F767M1BIYOQMPFN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5P/2ISF/IYOQMPFQ/F5P2ISFIYOQMPFQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBM/J7EF/IYOQMPGQ/FBMJ7EFIYOQMPGQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9T/6SYX/IYOQMPGT/F9T6SYXIYOQMPGT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA6/GNR6/IYOQMPHS/FA6GNR6IYOQMPHS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Ocean in a Bottle"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I noticed after a day playing with them, the clarity in the oil went bad.

There is an official kit, with standard wood block (that can be modified according to the Scout\u2019s vision), and plastic wheels with metal axles. The popularity of this event amongst youth has led to the development of a small industry supplying various and necessary components, such as race timers.\nThis Instructable describes a simple race timer based on an Arduino Uno. There are commercial devices that are more richly featured, but this Instructable is for a Cub Pack that may not have the funds for a premium solution. As various tracks differ greatly, it concentrates on the software and basic interface. This example is for three tracks; as long as you have two pins available for each additional lane, you can add lanes. The same software can work with an Arduino Mega and with that model, you could have more lanes than you can deal with. The Instructable does NOT cover construction on the track.\nA gantry over the finish line holds one IR LED for each lane. In the lane center piece (which is used as a guide for the cars), the detector, which has been mounted in a tube, is glued into a hole. When a car crosses the finish line, it breaks the beam and the Arduino records the event. It displays the results by blinking white LEDS in a pattern over each lane. One blink, first place. Two blinks, second place.

The cards rank as follows: A (high), K, Q, J, 10 (low).\nOverview of earning points\nThere are two ways to earn points each round:\nScoring melds (This is done after the bidding phase and before tricks)\nScoring tricks (This is done after all the tricks are played)\nOverview of a round\nEach round has the following general pattern:\n20 cards are dealt to each player\nEach team bids on how many points they think they can win during this round.\nThe winner of the bid chooses a suit to be the trump suit\nTeams score points based on the different melds (special combinations of cards) that they have in their hands\nThe players play and win tricks (sets of four cards)\nThe teams score points based on the cards in the tricks that they won.\nSetup\nPinochle is a card game played with four people on two teams.

Scoring is by team, not by individual player.\nIt\u2019s okay to reuse a card in different melds of different types. For example, a card can be used in a Royal Marriage and a Pinochle, because those melds are different types. However, a card cannot be reused for two melds of the same type.\nYou do not need to show cards that don't score you points during the meld\nThe table above gives different score values for the melds, depending on how many of that meld you have in your hand.

This would score a total of 30 points for the two melds.\nCount each player\u2019s meld scores individually, but then add together partners\u2019 scores.

(Photographs 1 to 6)\nWith the fourth you have selected to construct SS-3, fold the paper in half along its length and width to divide it\ninto fourths. Cut along the length-wise center crease. Keep the remaining paper below--this will become SS-4 in the next step. (Photographs 7 to 14)\nWith this new and smaller piece, again fold the paper up in half along its length center crease and pull the length sides' edges into the center crease to create new fourth folds. (Photographs 15 to 18)\nFold the length edges of the paper into the center again to make eighth folds. After you have done this, fold the eighths over top of one another. (Photographs 19 to 22)\nAccentuate the width center crease with your pencil; with the open edge facing toward the maker constructing the piece and identify side as SS-3L and the right as SS-3R. With this done, cut along the width half fold to bisect the paper. (Photographs 23 to 25)\nOn SS-3L, measure 1.125 inches from the inboard half mark you just cut previously. On SS-3R, measure 1.125 inches from the inboard half mark you just cut previously.

Try an keep power distributed fairly evenly, and bring pieces over to add strength if you see an attack coming.\n\nWhen attacking, it's a bad idea to let any of your pieces become cut off from your main force.

Have you ever seen a baseball pitching machine or tennis ball launcher? No? What about the mechanism inside one of those battery powered Nerf guns? No? Okay...\nThe launcher uses two wheels with grippy rubber tyres, both spinning very fast in opposite directions. The left one spins anticlockwise, and the right one spins clockwise.

It's not too difficult to build, no motors are needed and works about 90% of the time when instructions are carefully followed.\nYou can check out step 1 for the special pieces that you'll need to build this separator. Also 11 Medium yellow (or grey) and 7 small bleu (or brown) gears are needed. If you don't have 11 Med yellow gears, don't worry, you can replace the 7 Med gears in step 9 and 10 with the Med red gears instead.\nIn step 19 you'll see that a little table needs to be made and fixed underneath the separator. This table puts the separator at an angle of 12 degrees, which is very important! So if you want to use this separator in one of your machines, make sure it stands at an angle of 12 degrees.\nYou can always watch the video to see how it works.\nIf there are any complains, problems

We push the lab tables together (end to end) to make a series of long tables. We set up three cups at the end of the table filled with sand. Students work in pairs to either hit the cups (one point) or sink the marble into the cups (3 points). First to 10 wins, but they have to win by 2.

Possible variables include but are not limited to:\nthe distance the throwing arm gets pulled back in cm.\nthe number of rubber bands\nthe mass of the projectile\nthe angle the throwing arm gets pulled back\nthe angle of the throwing arm at it's stopping point\nthe size of the basket\nEvidence: Students then design an experiment to test their claim. They collect data and create a data table.\nReasoning: Students are then expected to be able to use the evidence they collected to support their claim. For example: To launch a catapult 300 cm, students must be aware of the distance the throwing arm gets pulled back in centimeters and the number of rubber bands. First, our team used a metric ruler to mark centimeters 1-6 on the \"A\" frame of our catapult. Next, we collected 4 rubber bands. To keep the mass of the projectile the same, we used the same marble with a mass of 4.5 grams for the entire experiment. According to our data, using 3 rubber bands and pulling the throwing arm back a distance of 4 cm resulted in a throwing distance of 300 cm. Our next closest trial was using 2 rubber bands and pulling the throwing arm back 6 cm because the marble landed 315 cm away.

It is by far the most complex and difficult build for me yet both structurally and ascetically. I used the high quality model version of the banshee seen in the cinematics for the game rather than the in game unit model which when you look at the pictures(at the end above) you will see there is a large difference between the 2, so I went with the more geometric and higher resolution version for this build. All of the reference pictures I used to make this are above, I used nothing else(I couldn't find anything else).\n\nIn this project I pushed the limits of K'nex pieces many times to get angles and shapes that the standard K'nex angles (45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315, 360 degrees) don't support. The biggest challenge for me (structurally wise) in this project was how to get the main body to support the very large twin turbofans without breaking or sagging. One idea I considered was using gears to raise and lower the turbofan arms like it does in game ( as I could in this build but did not have enough pieces in the right color or certain pieces only had a few select colors.

It's very important that the camera's operating voltage is starting at 3.6 Volt as toy quadcopters are usually powered by a single 3.7V lipo battery. You can find cameras for around 20 USD here or here.\nLast but not least you will need a FPV monitor or FPV goggles to receive the transmitted video signal. There are lot of good options out there, you can check out banggood or gearbest.\nBesides, you will need\na soldering iron and tin,\na Phillips screw driver\nand double sided duct tape.\nHave fun!", "title": "How to Convert a Toy Quadcopter Into a FPV Racer", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Convert-a-Toy-Quadcopter-Into-a-FPV-Racer/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "First, you have to remove the lower chassis:\nRemove all the screws on the bottom of the chassis.

We can easily do this by capping the internal wall with a piece of aluminum foil - make sure the foil goes slightly over the edges to trap heat - and heating it with a candle's flame.\nI found it was easy to use 3 fire bricks and arrange them as shown, with a tea light in the slot between them.

It advises you to follow your heart and intuition if you are to take a leap toward achieving a goal. In practical terms, The Lovers can also reveal outgrowing an environment, such as a young person leaving home and taking a step toward independence. (Dean, 2008, 20)\nReversed Meaning\nBreak-ups and commitment issues: one person may pull away from a relationship rather than work through difficulties. Tension mounts as imbalance and temptation creep in, such as seeking out an affair as a way of avoiding problems. Otherwise, this immaturity may be expressed as overdependence on a parent.

As the charioteer uses the force of his will to bring together everything he needs for his journey, you move on toward a new relationship or career, although The Chariot can also show an important journey, learning or drive, or a new means of transport. At this time, you show great determination to get where you want to go -- and you will reach your destination. The horses represent libido, so there is also the frisson of sexual adventure here. The horses, dark and white, echo the dark and light aspects of the journey ahead. (Dean, 2008, 21)\nReversed Meaning\nEgo and arrogance bring problems.

As a general influence, in a reading, Justice argues for a reasoned, pragmatic approach to challenges as opposed to avoidance and denial, or extreme responses. Balance is all. (Dean, 2008, 22)\nReversed Meaning\nIn the reversed position, Justice shows a miscarriage or justice. A decision goes against you, or a straightforward situation becomes unnecessarily complicated and the true facts of the matter become hidden.

The Hermit also shows a recuperation period after an illness or operation. (Dean, 2008, 23)\nReversed Meaning\nEnforced isolation. Refusal to learn or listen to advice may result in withdrawal from others in anger or resentment. You may need more time to come to terms with a situation you do not wish to accept.

If provoked, be prepared to spend time in negotiation, and stand your ground. Aims can be achieved with quiet confidence rather then displays of overt strength. This card is also about internal conflict and the necessity of accepting your shadow side. In a generally positive reading, Strength also symbolizes good health.

As this card literally shows, you may need to hang around waiting for someone else to make a decision. In this case, there is little you can do but wait. Analyze the situation with detachment and you may see new opportunities from a distance, rather than obsess about an outcome you are powerless to change. (Dean, 2008, 26)\nReversed Meaning\nBetrayal, often of the self. You may shy away from making a life-changing decision because it means initial discomfort or expense, and even yearn to return to the life you has as a dependent child.

I don\u2019t really remember why, but I guess it must have been that I didn\u2019t have any welder to use and that aluminium could be soldered (or so I hoped, but it turned out I was partially wrong). My project included several stiff connections. Additionally, aluminium is somewhat bending- and blacksmithing-friendly.\nI think every M41a amateur constructor starts from papercraft, which is actually a good starting point for everyone who attempts to construct a bigger model. I based my model on a plan from a webpage that sadly does not work anymore - www.usmcblackwatch.feeserve.co.uk.\nTo be honest, my paper model was quite rough and quickly done (true and accurate models need a few days of making). All I needed was just a scale and something to look up to just in case.\nNext, basing on my model (and on a load of web images) I made tech plans and a template that was later used for cutting from aluminium sheets.\nI used Solid Edge 2D, a free and user friendly program. I needed to draw a flat plan and the program served the need perfectly.\nI based my plans on milimeters.

At first I planned to fit a tube for 40 mm gas grenade there; however, the case would be too big when compared to replica\u2019s overall width.\nI also had an idea to install a banger launcher inside. The construction of a slingshot with a guide rail seemed promising, but launching the banger posed a little problem. After each launch, there was just a short moment in time for taking a shot. As a result, my \u2018grenades\u2019 were exploding before even reaching the target.\nFinally, I decided to stick to the original replica\u2019s construction. I bought a cheap airsoft shotgun at local kermess, removed unnecessary accessories and shortened it as much as I could. It fit just right.\nThen, I drew a template for the shotgun\u2019s cover.

It was supposed to count down from 99 to 0. Well, it was quite a challenge, since I don't know much about electronics.\nI wanted to use IR diode and a photodiode, as it fit my possibilities. The moment the pellet was between these two elements, the ray of light was supposed to be interrupted and the counter was to be given the right information.\nIt turned out that the counter based on a photodiode works great when it comes to detect a pencil, but a pellet - not so much.\nThen I found a web page with a working pellet counter (programming is not my strongest skill either).\nhttp://jenswilly.dk/tag/airsoftroundscounter/\nThis solved most of my problems. The program worked exactly as I wanted; I was able to understand it and even to modify it a bit. The program counts from 180 to 0, but the counter display shows only two last digits. For me it is better this way.\nI switched photodiode to phototransistor and it started to work. Well, at least it detected a few series of pellets while shooting.\nOne year later I switched that phototransistor to type QRD1114 and it worked just as I wanted - it counted every single pellet shot and pellets shots in series.\nMy display consists of two 7-segment displays. That may not be the best solution, but it gives quite clear view and it\u2019s user-friendly. I soldered both displays to a universal board together with two buttons. One button manually switches the counter off and the other one resets the system.\nInside magazine\u2019s chamber I placed a microswitch that engages the counter whenever mag is put in, and switches it off whenever it\u2019s removed. So, everytime you switch mags, you reset the counter.\nI had to re-design the board in Eagle PCB program.\nI moved several elements, so that the board was more narrow and I changed smd elements to through-hole elements.\nI also added an ISP socket, in case I needed to make some changes in the code, and an off-switch to cut the power.\nI printed the project, placed it on the PCB laminate and used a pin to make dots - later solder points.\nAfter making all necessary dots, I connected them by drawing line paths with CD marker.\nAfter prepatrations, I placed the board in a jar filled with a solution of ferric chloride. The \u2018bath\u2019 took about 30-40 minutes. I had to stir it several times in the meantime, so that the process underwent evenly.\nThen, the board needed to be washed under running water.

Its cost closed in about 250$.\nBut... After several airsoft games it turned out that the \u2018aiming rail\u2019 is good enough only for shooting from the hip, and I\u2019m way behind Vasquez\u2019 level of badassness, so I had to add some genuine accessories. At the time I didn\u2019t want to change the gun\u2019s original look too much. That\u2019s why I chose MRDS aimpoint.\nTo install it, I had to add RIS rail in the middle of the bar. I used the plastic one that was part of my cheap shotgun. The aimpoint itself was nice, small.. and faulty. It didn\u2019t always work in the field. I couldn\u2019t figure out if it was because of the wind or rain. I tested it in the forest during springtime. After that, I tested Flip Flop, but I don\u2019t remember its producer.\nIn order to install it, I had to add two RIS rails - one in the back and one in the front. They were precise and durable. They also had wide regulation possibilities. I played with them during respawns.\nI had used them for a couple of months until I lost the sight somewhere during one big game. It was the time when the gun had already become commonplace and I didn\u2019t care anymore so much about sticking to the original look. I decided to install Eotech 551 clone. To be honest, it raised the aiming spot quite high, but such configuration made this gun more comfortable to use. It has worked flawlessly for two years now.\nOnce the external barrel slackenned off and I shot the phototransistor, that found itself in the shooting range. Since that accident, the counter display still works, but it doesn\u2019t react to shots. After a few shots the grenade launcher\u2019s pump handle cracked. The pin that was cropping out from the shotgun\u2019s slide was too small and it tore its socket in the handle.\nBut... After three years my replica still works. I built it to endure rough conditions, and I have to admin that I really didn\u2019t spare it. It survived heavy rains, snow, minus temperatures and heat. It survived close counter with mud and sand.

I have three kids... including a 5-year-old who wants to join in with her older brother and sister. We only had one working set (my son's Fireball Challenge set that we bought him a few years ago, and which hasn't seen a great deal of use) and a couple of add-on pieces. However, it was only suitable for two-person racing, and some of the curves were a little too advanced for my 5-year-old. Fortunately a relative had given us some second-hand track, cars, and (thankfully) a third controller that he'd picked up at a garage sale. Just perfect for an additional raceway! All I had to do was clean up the track (a story for another time) and get a third car in working order (also a story for another time).\nFast-forward a week or so, and my 5-year-old was happily racing her own AFX car around an independent track set inside her siblings' track. Unfortunately, the cords on the standard AFX controllers are very short, and 5-year-old excitement levels are very high. At one point my 5-year-old lifted her controller too high and pulled on the cord, dislodging her track and her siblings' track. After fixing up the track, we then discovered that her controller was no longer working. After some testing, and on further inspection, it turned out one of the wires had snapped right at the base of the controller.\nUnlike the old orange/yellow Aurora AFX russkit controllers (which are screwed together), the standard AFX controllers in more recent sets are glued together and are not designed to be user-servicable. They are notoriously fickle, and are designed to be thrown out and replaced rather than repaired. Depending on what the fault is, a repair may not possible - and there's no guarantee that you won't crack the casing or further damage the internal components while attempting a repair. However, with some basic tools, a little care and some patience, you should be able to open up that controller and repair some simple faults (such as a broken wire or loose contact), and you can even make some improvements on the basic design (eg. adding a longer cord) if you wish. If it's not working anyway, what have you got to lose?\nIn the case of a broken wire, soldering is not required (depending on where the break is, of course) but may be beneficial.\nI'm happy to report that my 5-year-old now has a fully-functioning controller with a longer cord (much to the envy of her siblings), and all for less than $1 AUD. You can buy factory-built Tomy AFX controllers with longer cords, and I'd ordered a couple of these from overseas before I considered repairing the controller myself. I wish I'd waited, as it turned out to be such an easy (and cheap) fix.\n(On a side-note, this is my first Instructable ever.

Do this a couple of times, pressing a little harder each time to make the scoring deeper. Mind your fingers! SAFETY TIP: Sit the controller on a cutting mat/board while scoring, as it will give you more control and stability than simply holding it in your hands.\nWorking on one small section at a time, continue scoring and pressing harder (within reason) until the blade pierces the seam. In some places there is a tab that runs under the seam - you don't have to cut through these (and the casing will probably fit back together better if you don't), but it's not a big problem if you do. Again, sit the controller on a cutting mat/board for more control.\nRepeat as above, until the seam is breached at a number of points around the controller.\nWedge a small flat-head screwdriver a short way into one of the breaches, and twist or lever the screwdriver to prise open more of the seam. Take your time, and avoid exerting too much pressure, otherwise you may damage the casing along the seam-edges or even crack the casing. Also avoid pushing the screwdriver too far into the casing, or you may damage its internal components. SAFETY TIP: Wherever possible, avoid using the Stanley knife to prise open the seam. If you absolutely have to do this in order to get the screwdriver in, consider wearing safety goggles just in case the blade snaps.\nContinue working your way around the seam. Using a combination of small and large flat-head screwdrivers, gently twist or lever them to prise open more of the seam. You may hear some internal cracks or pops - that's to be expected, provided that you're not sticking the screwdrivers in too far. It's probably just the glue or the plastic pins (refer below) coming apart. Take your time, work gently, steer clear of the internal components, and everything should be okay.\nEventually you'll get to the stage where you can start to pull the casing open with your bare hands. CAUTION: It's tempting to rush this step, and just pull the whole thing wide open. You may snap or crack the casing if you do, so proceed gently! There are five plastic pins holding the casing together, one at the base of the handle (just behind where the cord comes out), one at the \"thumb rest\" on the back of the handle, one just forward of the trigger, and two at the top (one at either end). You may have already cut or broken some of these in the steps above. Some may be glued tightly, and you may need to break the remainder of the pins before the casing comes apart completely. In my case, only one of the pins (top rear) survived unscathed - the pins at the top front and thumb rest had to be cut with the Stanley knife, and the one near the trigger snapped with a gentle application of force. The one that gave me real trouble was the one at the base of the handle - after I'd released everything else, I had to twist the two halves of the casing in opposite directions in order to break that last pin.\nLay the controller with its handle to the left, and remove the \"top\" half of the casing.

In this case though, there's a broken wire right at the base of the handle, so let's fix that.\nUsing the side-cutters, cut the wire neatly just below the break. This will give you a length of cord with the standard Tomy AFX plug at the end of it. Don't throw it out!\nSplicing the wire together right at the base of the handle is not going to be feasible, so cut the other end of the wire a little further up into the handle. This will have the added advantage of hiding the splice within the handle.\nStrip 2-3cm of insulation from the cut ends of each wire. OPTIONAL: If you want to lengthen the cord, cut some speaker wire to length (I added an extra metre) and strip the insulation from both ends.\nMatch up the striped wires, and splice them together first (this will help ensure that you match up each wire to its mate, so that the plug is wired correctly). Initially I had separated the strands of each wire into two groups to form a \"Y\", as I don't have a soldering iron and had planned to splice them together using this method for inline splices. However, I must have mucked it up because the end result was very weak and my splice basically just fell apart. So I just ended up going with a basic (and ugly) twist splice (also known as a pig-tail or rat-tail splice). Do whatever splice works for you.\nSplice the non-striped wires together.\nWrap each splice with a couple of turns of electrical tape to insulate it. OPTIONAL: If you've got nice neat inline splices, use some heat-shrink tubing instead.\nWrap the wire around the plastic pin inside the base of the handle and pass it out through the bottom notch.

I needed to cut another 12\" board to match it using my jig saw.\nI found that cutting this laminate was done best with a saw blade that had as many teeth as possible (mine was 20 teeth/inch). This worked great, until my blade dulled, then broke.

I wish I had a couple more spring clamps, but this seemed to work well. I left these a few hours and they were set enough to move onto the next step\n3) snap in and glue down two boards at a time (a course). I used plenty of glue and made sure each board was snug against the boards they were snapped.\n- notice that I aligned each course of boards with one side and all of them, except one, overlapped. These will need to be trimmed in the next step.\n4) Because I used the anchor board at the far edge, my courses ended with about 1/2\" of OSB sticking out.

You can use this project if you are a stressed out student like me or if you know someone who should relief some of their stress.\nWhen I heard we had to build something with Arduino I had no single idea what to do. So what does one do when they could use a little bit more inspiration? Yes, exactly! Go to the internet for help! I knew I needed something with clear instructions which didn\u2019t require me to have too much experience with coding. So after looking around on instructables and saving some projects that stood out to me, I chose this one (https://www.instructables.com/id/Animate-a-Billy-Bass-Mouth-With-Any-Audio-Source/?ALLSTEPS) because it seemed like a lot of fun and I thought I could really personalize it. A lot of credit goes to the writer of the linked instructable Donald Bell, I just added my own personal touch to his project.\nThe materials you will need for this Instructable are:\n\u00b7 A big mouth Billy Bass singing Fish\n\u00b7 An Arduino Uno\n\u00b7 An Adafruit Motor Shield v2\n\u00b7 A Panel-Mount mini jack\n\u00b7 A mini jack audio cable\n\u00b7 A mini jack splitter cable\n\u00b7 Hookup wire (preferably in multiple colours, I used black, white, yellow and red)\n\u00b7 A small rechargeable speaker\n\u00b7 An audiosource (you can use your mobile phone for this)\n\u00b7 Stress that needs to be relieved\nThe tools you need:\n\u00b7 A small screwdriver\n\u00b7 A soldering iron and solder\n\u00b7 Wire strippers", "title": "The Stressed Art Student", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Stressed-Art-Student/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Luckily for all of you animal lovers out there, you don\u2019t need a knife to cut this fish up, but rather a small screwdriver to undo the screws on the back panel.

After you have opened it up you can unplug the cable harnesses so that you can remove the back completely and have some more space to work. Then you should unscrew and set aside the fish\u2019s circuit board and the little piezo buzzer for some more space to put the electronics we will be adding.\nWhat you will be left with is the front of the fish with one 4-wire harness. Two of these wires lead to the mouth, and the other to lead to the little motor in the middle that moves the head or the tail. Now cut 4 pieces of wire in equal lengths (my wires were about 15 cm but you should do what works best for you). You can use any colours you want, but using colours of wire that are comparable to the ones in the cable harness seems less confusing.

If game play is going longer than a specified time (usually 75 minutes, but varies with league) and a team has not reached 13/15 points, a soft cap is given. The highest score is taken and two points are added - that is the new score to end the game. If soft cap is not reached within specified time (usually 10 minutes), hard cap is placed, meaning the game ends at the next point.\n4. Points are scored by advancing your disc from one end of the field to the end zone at the opposite side. The disc must be caught within the 25 m by 40 m end zone.\n5. The disc is advanced by being thrown from player to player. If the disc is dropped or if a defender intercepts the disc, it is a turnover and the other team may pick up the disc and try to start moving it to their end zone. Travels occur when the person catching the disc takes more steps then needed to stop their movement, or changes direction and speed while slowing down. Travels also occur when the player with the disc moves both feet - a pivot foot must be maintained.\n6. The person holding the disc has 10 stall counts to throw it to another player. If the stall count reaches 10, it is a turnover. Stall count is managed by whoever is guarding the person with the disc. They must be within 10 feet of the person with the disc and count out loud.\n7. If the person guarding the disc contacts the thrower - hits their hand or arm, or runs into their body - it is a foul.

This can cause strings to break.\nTo prepare yourself to tune the entire keyboard, it is helpful to spend some time tuning unisons (single notes). Since most keys on the piano have either 2 or 3 strings, the strings for each key need to be tuned to precisely the same pitch. Even with an electronic tuning aid, you will use your ear to tell when the strings of one key are in tune with each other. For now, don't worry about whether the key is tuned to the correct pitch relative to the rest of the keyboard.\nChoose a note with 3 strings to tune. (To start, the ones in the middle of the keyboard are easier.)\nDecide which string to use as a reference to tune the other strings to.\nMute one of the strings (see picture). This is done so that you only hear the string you're tuning and the string you're using as a reference.\nPlace the tuning hammer on the tuning pin for the string you are tuning. The handle should be pointing roughly parallel to the strings toward the inside of the piano.\nPull the hammer to bring the string slightly sharp of where it should be.\nMove the hammer back the other way until the string is in tune. As you do this, listen to the sound of the two strings carefully. When they are far out of tune, you will hear a fast beating in the sound, which will slow down as they approach the same pitch. If they are perfectly in tune, there will be no beating at all.\nOnce the two strings are in tune, mute the string you just tuned, and unmute the remaining string. Repeat the process for this string.\nNotes:\nThe method of bringing the string into tune from the sharp direction helps the pin to stay where you put it. If a string is flat and you simply bring it up to pitch by increasing the tension, it will tend to loosen on its own after a short time (like a spring unwinding, but slower).\nHaving the tuning hammer parallel to the string reduces the amount that your twisting motion can tilt the pin forward or backward, which would change the tension on the string until you release pressure on the hammer, causing error in the tuning.\nIt is better to use quick, short movements of the hammer, rather than long, steady ones. This improves the tuning stability. When you are starting out, you may need to move the hammer more slowly to practice listening to beating and train your ear to identify when strings are in tune.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGU/7YZR/IY4QFJNC/FGU7YZRIY4QFJNC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWT/LH12/IY4QFHWY/FWTLH12IY4QFHWY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Practice Tuning Single Notes"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Entropy is free and open source, and relatively easy to install if you have a common platform. It can be downloaded here.\nThe reason for using software to help tune a piano is that the non-ideal nature of the strings needs to be accounted for. If you were to tune a piano to ideal pitches (equal temperament), it would actually sound terrible, because the strings produce overtones that are not at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. Standalone electronic piano tuners and piano tuning software have ways of calculating how the pitch of each note should deviate from the equal temperament to make the harmonics line up better with each other. There are several programs that can do this; Entropy is not the only choice.

If you don't have cards then you will need money, or a generous friend, to get cards\n3. A creative mind\nElapsed Time:\nAnywhere from 15 minutes to a few days, depending on your skill level and dedication to the deck-building process.\nSo let's get started!", "title": "How to Make a \"Magic: the Gathering\" Deck", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Magic-the-Gathering-Deck/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "What type of player are you? Are you a more casual player looking for some fun in your downtime? Do you want to climb the ranks of the competitive community and be the top local, national, or even international player? What you want out of Magic will determine the format best for you. I will list some of the most popular formats that people play in. Decide which one best fits you and your needs.\nStandard: This competitive format plays cards from the most recent sets. After a recent change in the format, Wizards of the Coast (the company in charge of the game), decided to make sets rotate every year. This means that every year, the older sets will not be allowed in the format while the newest set(s) will be. Standard tends to be the most dynamic and unpredictable format, because rotations tend to completely change the way it is played. However, this also means that eventually you will have to change up or build completely new decks, meaning that you have to spend more money if you want to continuously play in this format.\nModern: Another competitive format that uses cards from the Eighth Edition set and forward. Unlike Standard, Modern doesn't rotate, so any cards from the allowed sets can be used, in addition to the newest sets. This format tends to be the fastest and one the most expensive, because it uses some of the best cards in Magic history. While new sets can shake up the format slightly, this one tends to be more stagnant than Standard, with the best decks staying at the top for long periods of time.\nCommander: This is the most popular casual format. What makes it unique compared to others is that you construct 100 card decks (instead of the usual 60) and you can only have one copy of each card. While not going into detail about the rules, Commander games, often played with 3 or more people, tend to be very explosive and unpredictable. Because of the multiplayer nature of the game, it is the most interactive and arguably the most fun out of all the formats. However, you won't see any tournaments in this format on the competitive level.\nI will briefly list other formats, both to save space and because I lack experience in these: Vintage, Legacy, Pauper, Frontier, to name a few more.\nNOTE: It is always important to be aware of the cards that are banned in each format to avoid unnecessary expense.\nPicture is from https://warosu.org/tg/thread/46178757", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSQ/DUND/IY3CURMR/FSQDUNDIY3CURMR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Decide What Format You Want to Play"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Once you have figured out what format you want to play, this can be the both easiest and hardest part of building a deck.\nDecide what type of deck interests you. Are you more of an aggressive player, going for the all-in type of approach? Or are you a more reactionary player who likes to control the tempo of the game until you can cast your huge creatures or planeswalkers? Maybe a mix of both? You could be the type of person that likes to bend the rules and use \"Alternate Win Conditions\", cards that will win you the game by themselves under the right circumstances, such as the one shown above.\nWhatever your style of play is, you can create a deck that you can both win and have fun with at the same time.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2I/AI1W/IY4Q5N32/F2IAI1WIY4Q5N32.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Decide What Type of Deck You Want to Build"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Once you have found the type of deck you want to build, the next step is to decide what Colors you want to build around. For beginning players, look at cards that interest you and base your decision around that. More experienced players will want to build a deck around an \"archetype\", where you play cards that work well with each other and have effects that collectively increase the power of the deck.\nAn example is the card shown above. It is a card with Red and Black colors. In addition it is a Vampire and has a very powerful effect that works well with the Madness mechanic and other Vampires. This card would therefore go best in an aggressive Red and Black deck with a Vampire/Madness theme.\nAs I will go into further detail later, you want to make sure that you don't have too many colors in your deck. Decks with 3 or more colors tend to be more inconsistent because you decrease the chances that you draw lands that produce the colors you need. Beginning players will want to stick to two or even one color decks because they tend to be easier to build and buying many different multi-colored lands can be expensive\nNOTE: This is not absolute and depends on the format. Some formats like Commander encourage you to play many colors because they are slower and more casual.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFH/K57W/IY4Q5IR6/FFHK57WIY4Q5IR6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Building Your Deck: Colors"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "With the basic outline of the deck done, now it's time to fill it in. Choose cards that work well together and support the theme of the deck. For aggressive decks you will likely want the a sizable portion of your spells to be low mana-costed creatures and pump spells. Control decks will want a lot of removal, cards that get rid of your opponent's creatures/planeswalkers/artifacts/etc and have very powerful cards that when cast will turn the game around in the later portion of the game. Combo decks will want to play the pieces of the combo and have cards that support and/or protect the combo from being interrupted. Always remember synergy. The more your spells play off of each other, the more powerful the deck tends to be.\nI will continue to use the example of the Red/Black Vampires to show you what kind of cards would fit well in that deck. Stromkirk Condemned shown above is great because it enables you to discard cards, which is fantastic in a deck that encourages you to do so. In addition it powers up all of your vampires when you do. Falkenrath Gorger is good by itself, because 2/1 creatures for 1 mana are always good in aggressive strategies, but in addition to that it gives all your Vampires Madness, so that you can cast them when you would normally discard. Fiery Temper is absolutely great in this deck. Normally it is a 3 mana burn for 3 damage, but with madness it costs only a single red mana! Stensia Masquerade not only gives your attacking creatures first-strike, a nightmare for your opponent to deal with, but when damage gets through every vampire that did combat damage to the opponent will get a +1/+1 counter.\nYou can have up to 4 copies of any particular spell in your deck. It is up to you to decide how many. A good rule of thumb is to put 4 copies of the most important cards in the deck and work your way down. Sometimes you might have to remove some copies of cards to make room for others.\nNOTE: This doesn't apply to Commander, because you can only have 1 copy of any particular card", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2U/BRAG/IY4Q5IAA/F2UBRAGIY4Q5IAA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7F/ZLAU/IY3CX8W9/F7FZLAUIY3CX8W9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9M/0BMV/IY3CX8WP/F9M0BMVIY3CX8WP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Z/3Q6S/IY4Q5IOQ/F8Z3Q6SIY4Q5IOQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Building Your Deck: Spells"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The mana curve is one of the least talked about, yet most important part about constructing your deck. The mana curve is simply the distribution of cards with a certain mana cost, and the curve comes from the shape of the graph, looking somewhat like a shifted Bell Curve or Normal Distribution curve. You want to be efficient with your mana since you can only play at most one land per turn. When you have found the cards you want in your deck, construct a mana curve so you can see how distributed your spells are.\nAggressive decks should have a mana curve that looks similar to the one shown above. Most of the cards in the graph have a converted mana cost of 2, and cards with mana costs of 1 and 3 are a close second. The amount of cards with mana costs of 4+ then makes a steep decline. This pairs well with the intentions of aggressive decks because they want to be able to cast many cheaper creatures/spells to beat the opponent as fast as possible.\nControl decks tend to have a mana curve shifted slightly more to the right than the above graph. Their peak would lie somewhere around the 3 or even 4 mana cost range because they are more about controlling the pace of the game until they can play their most powerful, high-costed spells.\nNOTE: Your mana curve does not need to be exactly like the one shown above even if you are playing aggressively, but when you create your deck, the shape of the curve should at least resemble it to some degree.\nPicture is from http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/183623/what_magic_the_gathering_can_.php?print=1", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIR/1F7P/IY4Q5DRQ/FIR1F7PIY4Q5DRQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Building Your Deck: Mana Curve"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "For decks of a single color, this is the simplest part, because they only require one type of land. However, it gets more complicated the more colors are in your deck. Decks with 2 or more colors will almost always need dual lands, lands that produce two colors, to make sure you get the multiple colors that you need.\nPut as many dual-colored lands in your deck as you can where it doesn't impinge on the play of the deck. For example, you might not want to run too many dual colored lands in a two-color aggressive deck because many dual lands come into play tapped if the conditions are not right, which prevents you from going as fast as you can. Slower more control-based decks have more leeway when using dual lands because they can afford to play a little slower.\nIn total, the total amount of lands in any particular deck can be anywhere from 18-26 lands, depending on how fast or slow it is. A good number for the average 60 card deck is about 24 lands. Test your deck with the lands you put in and see how well it plays.\nNOTE: This often depends on the format. The best dual-colored lands are in older sets, so decks in those formats will tend to want to play as many dual-lands as they can.\nPicture is from http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/magic-fundamentals/magic-general/606212-a-sets-basic-land-art-forming-one-image", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVQ/BQYY/IY4Q5QPN/FVQBQYYIY4Q5QPN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Building Your Deck: Lands"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "So you have constructed your deck. The last thing you need before you're ready to go out there and compete is a sideboard, a group of 15 cards from which you can put in and take out cards from your deck in between games.\nThink of a sideboard like an extension of your deck. Put cards into your sideboard that are better against specific kinds of decks that you see often. For example, if many people are playing artifact decks, put cards into your sideboard that get rid of or at least deal with artifacts. For those pesky creature-based aggressive decks you could put in boardwipes, cards that do damage to or destroy all creatures on the field.\nThe sideboard is one of the hidden arts of the game. It requires a knowledge of the current metagame, that is the kind of decks and cards that currently make up the majority of the playing field. The knowledge of sideboarding is something that will take a while to master, but once done will transform you from a good to a great player.\nPicture is from http://www.manaleak.com/mtguk/2016/03/5-things-magic-players-need-to-think-about/", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQO/CP0E/IY4Q5KG7/FQOCP0EIY4Q5KG7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Building Your Deck: Sideboard"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "The only way to truly gauge the power level of your deck is to use it.

I selected some pieces of timber framing from an old cabinet that was found at the tip and dismantled. These were 42x19mm in profile. The photos show the steps I took to end up with square and uniformly dimensioned pieces of wood. In order, I:\nA) used an electric planer to remove surface weathering and discoloration;\nB) used a combination square to mark damaged ends for removal and sawed these off square with an electric mitre saw;\nC) cut 295mm sections using mitre saw. To ensure these were the exact same length I stacked all five and clamped them so ends on the left hand side were square with each other. The ends on the right hand side were resawn, ensuring blade trimmed even the shortest length ever so slightly.

If you have a kit with dowel centering pins you can use this method:\nDrill two dowel holes in each end of the piece.\nFit centering pins into the two holes at the bottom and gently position the piece as you'd like it to sit on the bottom piece of the frame. I chose to set this piece on an angle because I thought it would help with an ergonomic guiro action.\nHolding the piece in its desired position, bang the top of the wood so pins mark drill points in the bottom.\nDrill the holes in the bottom then glue and dowel this join.\nPlace the dowel centering pins in the top holes. Line up the top plate as desired and bang with a mallet, indicating spots to drill dowel holes in the top. Drill these holes.\nFitting bangclank sheet\nMeasure the width of the slot now that left and right sides have been joined to bottom.\nThe height of the sheet you need will be the length of your sides (295mm), plus 2x the depth of your slot. I estimated needing a rectangle 220x315mm.\nUse a combination square and pencil to mark the rectangle you need on whatever sheet metal you are using.\nCut metal carefully with strong scissors or tinsnips. My steel sheet was 1mm thich but if you procure something thicker or with corrugations, consider using a cutting blade on an angle grinder or a hacksaw.\nSlide sheet metal into the slot and see if top piece of frame will fit nicely. I ended up needing to trim off another 5mm from the top of the steel sheet before the top fitted.\nGluing / dowelling top joins\nNow you're ready to join the top pieces. Same as above!\nBike bell\nI decided the bike bell was going to be a right hand operation. The bottom right corner of the frame seemed like the place it belonged. To fit here, and for screws to be driven without bell being in the way, the bracket needed some adjustment using a pair of pliers. Mark location of holes, pre-drill with small bit and attach bike bell. Ka ching!\nAttach rope\nTo hang the board around your neck you will need a rope or strap.

Of course there were a few people on the Table Tennis websites saying, don't do it, it's not worth the effort! But in reality, it's quite easy and a fun project to do.

Rotate the board so that you are looking at it length ways - in my case this played a bit of a trick on my mind, as the width (940mm) was slightly longer than the length (915mm). Starting at the one corner, secure the masking tape underneath, and slowly stick it down the side - take some time to do this properly - these are going to be your lines after all!\nDo the same for the other side line, as well as the back line of the board.\nFor the middle line, measure the distance from the edge to the middle. In my case it was 470mm - and then subtract half the width of the masking tape (18mm/2 = 9mm). Therefore the start of the tape was 461mm from the edge of the board. Make a little mark on either side of the board, and stick your masking tape down the middle. Make sure it's stuck down properly - you don't want any paint sneaking in underneath.\nRight, now it's time for the paint - I used a water-based chalkboard paint - I'm sure there are better options, but it works fine for my needs - you want it to be a paint with a matte finish, and the chalkboard paint fulfills that quite nicely. Using the foam roller brush, apply 2-3 coats. Again, make sure it's nice and even, and pick out any specks or blobs as you go along. When it's touch dry, you can peel away the lines - this is when you'll get your first sense of accomplishment!\nNow wait for the paint to dry properly, and then apply masking tape in the inverse way to previously, i.e. on the inside of the border lines, and on either side of the centre line. In retrospect, I should have used spray paint (make sure you mask the areas outside of the lines with newspaper) - as when I run my hands over the lines, there is a definite change in texture - I think spray paint would've made it a bit smoother. Once the new areas have been masked, you can now paint the white lines using the roller.

Although the main point of this Instructable is to show a general rehab and upgrade of a cheap Strat-style guitar electric guitar, I also wanted to show how to wire the one volume/one tone knob mod.\nBy removing one of the tone pots, making the remaining tone pot a master tone for everything and moving the pots down one position each, you avoid accidentally hitting the volume knob, and can adjust the tone for all pickups with just one knob. The downside is that you can\u2019t easily use your pinky for cool swells if you\u2019re into that.\nThe guitar being use is a 2002 Squire Bullet Stratocaster. I bought that new from Guitar Center for about $70 as something for my kids to play with. It served its purpose well but really hasn\u2019t been used for years. I have been looking to keeping one of my guitars setup for slide (with heavier strings). As this Bullet had a hard tail and not a tremolo bridge, it seemed like a reasonable candidate for this. The big problem on this guitar is that the pickups were extremely cheap, microphonic, and just bad sounding and are not suitable for any kind serious playing.\nThe entire project was done with parts I had laying around (except for the 5-way switch). So if you have to go out and buy a bunch of parts, this may not be worth doing.\nFor this Instructable I will be demonstrating:\nFitting replacement pickguard/pickups\nWiring the one volume/one tone pot modification\nShow that it's worth polishing and waxing an old, cheap guitar", "title": "Rehab and Upgrades for a Fender Squire Strat - Plus Two Knob Mod", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Rehab-and-Upgrades-for-a-Fender-Squire-Strat-Plus-/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "To get started I removed the pickguard to see what the guitar had in it.

It contributes to challenge the arc always in the same way.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0Y/9JW1/IXQG247C/F0Y9JW1IXQG247C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9R/MR5V/IXQG24BZ/F9RMR5VIXQG24BZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Grip: Default Vs Custom"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Below I explain how you can realize your personal grip using some flour, a balloon and Additive Manufacturing (AM) and 3D scanning techniques.

I report some examples.\nIn step 2, I mentioned to the polysurface creation process considering only two photos of the mold. The modeling of the polysurface following this approach is not suitable for beginners but it allows to obtain satisfactory results. In practice, you have to take two pictures, considering a horizontal and longitudinal sections. The mold is divided in 4 parts given by the intersections of the two photos. You can draw the contour lines and then create the slices of different surfaces starting from the control lines. The same for the riser.

As a result, I might not mention some special circumstances in the game of Go-Stop such as when only one player in a 3 person game loses (usually there is only 1 winner with the assumption that the other players have lost).

Another way you can shuffle the cards is to spread the cards out onto the table and mix them around.\nPicture 2\nThere are four cards that represent each month of the year with an accompanying flower.. The basic objective of the game is to match cards with their respective sets (i.e. match cards from January with another card from January). Don't worry, there's no need to memorize what month/flower a particular card belongs to. Instead, you can think of it as matching cards with a similar theme and design.

The dealer is responsible for shuffling the cards, handing out the cards, and playing the first hand. You can play a simple game of rock-paper-scissors to decide who becomes the dealer. Then, the winner of each game afterwards will become the dealer.\nAfter shuffling the cards, the player to the left of the dealer will \"cut\" the deck. The player takes the cut portion of the deck and places it face down in the center of the table. Then, the dealer proceeds to hand out the cards. If the dealer runs out of cards to deal, then the deck on the table will be used to continue the deal. Any remaining cards will be placed back on the center of the table.\nThe cards are dealt in a counterclockwise direction starting with the player to the right of the dealer. Once the dealer gets the cards, the cards are then dealt face up on the table. This process is repeated once. The way the cards are handed out is different depending on the number players. I'll include how the cards are supposed to be handed out, but as long as the number of cards is the same it is okay to ignore the specifics. As a side note, the game is usually played with 3 players, so the rules of dealing out the cards for 4 players and up are what I follow. Any cards left after dealing are added to the deck in the center of the table.\nThe cards are dealt as follows:\n2 Players - Each player gets 10 cards and 8 cards are face up on the table. (5 to each player and then 4 to the table. Repeat Once.).\n3 Players - Each player gets 7 cards and 6 cards are face up on the table.

However, I had some issues learning the dabbing method so I ended up gluing the cloth to one side, clamping, and coming back to put glue on the second side and clamping a second time. You can do it however works best for you.\nNote that alignment is critical. The cut slots between the disk halves must line up so you can cut the disks apart later. You not only need to align side to side and get the slots to line up but it is also critical to make sure the halves are aligned vertically so that neither side is higher than the other -- so they are flush. It helps to have the snake body on a hard flat surface, so I ended putting the clamps on top of the snake to help keep it flat.\nAfter the glue has set you can cut away excess cloth and sand the cloth area flush to the body.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ4/PQT2/IXQFV9XK/FZ4PQT2IXQFV9XK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXT/6F5E/IXQFUWAK/FXT6F5EIXQFUWAK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK0/9SFM/IXQFV9W4/FK09SFMIXQFV9W4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8J/3Q3F/IXQFUW8O/F8J3Q3FIXQFUW8O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F68/HKD3/IXQFV9XN/F68HKD3IXQFV9XN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F50/VV40/IXQFVA0R/F50VV40IXQFVA0R.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Glue the Fabric in Place and Clamp the Halves Together"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Take the middle section that is now back to looking like a dowel and go back to the band saw and cut into the existing saw blade slots.

For more about the details of this project, check out our blog.\nCD balloon hovercrafts are a tried and true instructional tool in the classroom for teaching the concepts of friction, air flow, momentum and a host of other physics concepts. There are a lot of other Instructables out there with different methods, like this great one from The Children's Museum of Houston. Use whatever method or materials suit your needs best.\nThese devices float rather well on any smooth surface, and depending on what size balloon you use and how much air you allow to escape, can work for several minutes at a time. They are quick to make for almost any age. We've added a design challenge component to the facilitation of this activity to both make the device work better and challenge the participants to add their own ideas to the activity. Building a Better Hovercraft is a great way to explain it. Traditional ones get some drag when the balloon deflates enough to tip over - how can we creatively solve this issue to make the hovercrafts travel further and faster? Read on to find out!", "title": "CD and Balloon Hovercrafts Engineering Challenge", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/CD-and-Balloon-Hovercrafts-Engineering-Challenge/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "We do ours with film canisters and CDs, both items that used to be readily available and either free or cheap. Alas, as the progress of technology marches on, both are becoming less prevalent in the world. You just can't pick up AOL CDs out of the street for this activity anymore! Fortunately, you can still find all of the necessary materials for this activity online and locally.\nFilm canister (a thread spool, cut piece of PVC pipe, sports drink nozzle, etc. also work well - most anything with a hole in it that will fit over the hole in the middle of the CD works fine). Most photo developing shops will give you their old ones for free, so check there first before buying online! I get mine in bulk on Amazon.\nCD - any old used CD or DVD will work. You can also pick up packs of blank CDs at most electronics superstores. I grab mine on Amazon for large classes.\nBalloon. I recommend a larger one (9\" or even 12\") as you can get a lot more flight out of them, and they are easier to stretch over the nozzle than the smaller varieties.\nHot glue gun and hot glue.\nLarge tack or small nail. I love these novelty size push pins for kids, as they have a large area to grip for safety and are not super sharp.\nPipe cleaners.\nCraft sticks.\nPaper and scissors. Markers are good for decorating, too.\nTape - I love masking tape for this activity.\nOptional: For large groups of kids, I get these balloon pumps from Target or party store and put a piece of vinyl tubing over the tip so that it fits the hole in the CDs. It makes it MUCH easier to inflate the balloons over and over again without removing them or going breathless trying to blow them up through the bottom of the CD. Most party supply stores will also stock balloon pumps. I also designed a 3D printable piece made out of flexible filament that can fit over the tip of the pump to lock the CD in place - the file is attached below.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHI/JSWW/J76GKEB0/FHIJSWWJ76GKEB0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO0/2CKA/J76GKEAZ/FO02CKAJ76GKEAZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Materials and Tools Needed"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "First, you'll need to build the base of your hovercraft. Take the lid off the film canister - you can save it for other projects or chuck it. Put a little glue on the open end of the film canister and stick it to the cd, trying to center it over the center hole in the CD. At this point, there isn't a good seal at the bottom of the film canister, so some air could escape out the sides. Add a good bead of hot glue around the rim of the film canister to completely seal it up. Allow the glue to cool completely before going on to the next step.\nNOTE: Don't get hot glue on the bottom of the CD, or else it will hang up when you're launching! If you get a bit and are already most of the way through this process, simply glue another clean CD to the bottom of your existing CD.

Poke a few holes - see how it works and you can always remove the balloon to add more. Be careful with this step to not stab yourself!\nIt's good to ask at this point how the number of holes changes the float dynamics of the hovercraft. Will more make it go faster? Float more?

Make sure it sits down a little bit on the canister - about 1/2-3/4\" or 12-18mm. This will ensure it doesn't fly off. At this point you can blow through the bottom hole of the CD to inflate the balloon, or use a balloon pump with a piece of vinyl tubing (1/2\" ID tubing works well) or the attached adapter file printed in flexible filament.\nAlternatively, inflate the balloon and twist the top, then slip it over the canister - this is much harder to do, but can sometimes be easier than blowing through the bottom of the CD, especially if you have very few holes in the canister.\nOnce the balloon is inflated, twist the top around a few times to prevent the air flowing out before you're ready to launch. You can also just pinch the balloon stem, especially if you build a structure in the next step that won't allow for twisting. Give your hovercraft an initial test, and seal any gaps left over from the first step if there are any. Notice how floppy the balloon is, especially if you give it a firm push?

Notes required; .... Key ....\n....C to d ; C,D,F,G,c,d ; F-major\n....D to e ; D,E,G,a,d,e ; G-major\n.\nWhere the two differ more substantially is in the accompanying chords.\nHydraulophone is like an underwater flute that has 12 mouthpieces, so it can play up to 12 notes at the same time! Therefore to make full use of the polyphony, let's consider the two options.\nHere are the chords in the the key of F-major:\nF, C, F, Bflat, F, C, Dminor, Gminor, F\nand here are the chords in the key of G-major:\nG, D, G, C, G, D, Eminor, Aminor, D, G.\nMany hydraulophones installed in public parks/waterparks, beaches, museums, etc., don't provide end users with access to the tuning screws or valves or any adjustments of key, or the like.\nThus, in F-major we'll play the Bflat chord rootless, and we'll play the Gminor without the Bflat, i.e. as a Gsus.\nIn G-major we'll play the D chord as a Dsus chord (i.e. omit the F# from the chord).\nIt sounds better in G-major, because roots are more important to chords than the 3rd element of the chord.\nAnd I kind of like the way the Dsus sounds.\nTherefore, let's start with the key of G-major.\nIn the following step, I'll provide my arrangement for Auld Lang Syne in G-major for the 12-jet hydraulophone.", "title": "How to Play Auld Lang Syne on Hydraulophone (underwater Pipe Organ)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Play-Auld-Lang-Syne-on-Hydraulophone-underw/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "In the above diagram is my arrangement for Auld Lang Syne on 12-jet hydraulophone, with notes running left-to-right, and time-axis running down the page.

The name \"matryoshka\" literally \"little matron\", is a diminutive form of Russian female first name \"Matryona\" or \"Matriosha.\"\n\nA set of matryoshkas consist of a wooden figure which separates, top from bottom, to reveal a smaller figure of the same sort inside, which has, in turn, another figure inside of it, and so on.\n\nMatryoshka dolls are often referred to as \"babushka dolls\", babushka meaning \"grandmother\" or \"elderly woman\".", "title": "A Plush Matryoshka", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Plush-Matryoshka/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I started by making a pattern consisting of a head, face, feet and belly.

Next I ironed the cheeks into place and sewed a satin (zig-zag) stitch around them.\nHair: I ironed HeatnBondLite to fabric scraps and arranged them on the face pattern circles before adhering them to the faces. I decided to experiment and tried out several different styles and colors. Then I sewed a satin stitch that matched each hair color along the bottom edge of each hairdo.\nEyes: I chose to use buttons for eyes. Don't sew them on at this point though because there are still parts of the face that need to be sewn. You can use bits of embroidery thread to experiment with different features and expressions before you commit.\nMouth: I chose to do simple smiles that extended into the cheeks. I lightly drew the smiles on with a pencil and sewed a black satin stitch over top, then I doubled back over it to make it darker.\nFace: To make it pop out from the background I outlined each face circle with a black satin stitch, then doubled back over the whole circle to make it darker.\nI suggest doing an image search of matryoshka dolls for inspiration when you make your own.

Then I stitched them together in the corners to hold them in place and trimmed the excess.\nThen I used each body front to make a pattern for the back. I didn't worry about matching the front and back fabrics. The more patterns the merrier in my opinion.\nI ironed stabilizer to the back pieces as well. If I were to make these again I might try adding batting and a lining fabric for each one instead of stabilizer to make them a bit plumper.\nAt the last minute I decided to add a loop of ribbon to the top of each one as a hanging device.\nFinally, I placed the front and back panels together, outsides facing in, and with my serger sewed around the periphery of each doll. Then I reached in the belly holes, turned them right side out, and ironed them flat.\nFor the smallest doll, simply attach a back fabric and sew the two pieces together leaving a small opening at the bottom.

If something gets messed up, you can use a hair dryer to warm the hot glue so you can work with it again.\nTuck the end!\nTrim the leather about a half inch longer than the end of the pipe.

We noticed whenever we were visiting friends or at preschool they constantly want to use the play kitchen and pretend to cook. Also, at home, we have a stool they use to hang out at the kitchen counter and they're constantly checking out what we're making or wanting to help out. We could've just bought a nice kitchen from Costco or wherever but this way it would be special, something they'd remember, and something that would definitely last a long time! Now that Christmas is done we are happy to report this was a HUGE success, therefore I am more than happy to share it!\nI got some ideas from here on Instructables and Reddit. We found a used unit for free on Kijiji and I started planning it out and getting more ideas.\nMaterials & Tools:\nA big wooden TV entertainment centre/unit\nScrewdrivers\nDrill with appropriate screw and drill bits, circular saw bits\nPaint brushes\nJigsaw\nTable Saw\nCircular Saw\nPutty knife\nBelt/palm sander\nSandpaper - Heavy grit and medium-light.\nVarnish remover\nWood Glue\nWood Filler\nTape Measure\nCarpenter's Square\nBox Cutter\nPen\nPaint\nPainter's tape\nChalkboard paint\nSpray-paint\nPolyurethane (protective coat)\nExtra cupboard door Hinges\nCupboard door handles\nSink Faucet\nStainless steel dish\nPlywood - (1/2\" x 2' x' 4') for doors\nHardboard (1/4\" x 4' x 4')\nParticle Board (1/4\" x 2' x 2')\nPlexiglass (1/4\")\nGel paints\nGorilla Glue", "title": "Play Kitchen From Old Entertainment Centre", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Play-Kitchen-From-Old-Entertainment-Centre/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Start by taking off all the doors, knobs and hinges with a screwdriver or drill. Set aside any shelving and shelf holders it may have come with. Don't forget to save all the old screws and hinges and knobs! I also ended up cleaning the hinges/knobs after taking them off. The rear \"wall\" is cheap, very thin plywood which I took off and removed all the nails holding it. I discarded the old plywood (crumbling apart and had the precut holes in it).\nI used Minwax Paint & Varnish remover to strip the old, thick varnish on the whole unit. It is like a gel, and you just goop it on, leave it for 20-30 minutes, then scrape it all off with the putty knife, hoping the old varnish and some stain goes with it. It is pretty messy stuff. Don't forget to use eye protection and gloves! I used it on every surface, although the outside frame seemed to have more coated on. It would leave lots of dirt and gunk behind so I used Methyl Hydrate to clean it up and dry it all out, making it easy to wipe down after.\nNext is the fun part, and by far the most time consuming: Sanding. I used both a palm sander and just by hand to sand it down - starting with 40 grit ( I realize now I did not need to go that low, as the varnish remover did most of the stripping work) I worked up to 80 and 180, then 220 grit in some spots. In hindsight, I'd have been fine with 60-80 and finish with 180, much less work that way.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FEL/28OG/IXGFSLDC/FEL28OGIXGFSLDC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLE/32KJ/IXGFSMLJ/FLE32KJIXGFSMLJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7P/3A5Z/IXGFSLDJ/F7P3A5ZIXGFSLDJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS4/4J6E/IXGFSLP5/FS44J6EIXGFSLP5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGD/RBHC/IXGFSLM5/FGDRBHCIXGFSLM5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF3/18PB/IXGFSM4N/FF318PBIXGFSM4N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F86/GWRG/IXGFSM6K/F86GWRGIXGFSM6K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS9/HJMB/IXGFSLLU/FS9HJMBIXGFSLLU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3Y/ILMF/IXGFT6SB/F3YILMFIXGFT6SB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Strip the Entertainment Centre"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I used the 1/2 inch plywood to make 2 doors that would fit on the right side of the unit: the upper right for the fridge and lower right for the oven.

I also used wood filler at this point on some of the knots in the plywood, then sanded the 2 doors down until nice and smooth.\nNext I measured out where the faucet and sink would go. I flipped the bowl upside down and traced the edge. Also traced where the 2 pegs from the faucet would go. Measuring the width of the faucet pegs, I used the appropriate paddle bit for the drill and drilled through the frame. Next, I traced another line just inside of my sink tracing, to allow the lip of the bowl to rest on the frame. Drilled a hole through the sink location so I could then use the jigsaw to cut the big sink hole.\nThe faucet came with it's own plastic interface to clamp on. The lip of the bowl is just resting on the counter. If the kids keep punching it out when playing I can always try gluing it down with Gorilla glue.\nNow the 4' x 4' piece of thin plywood was screwed onto the back side as a solid rear wall of the unit.

I painted these aluminum. Next I screwed 4 right into the counter by the stovetop, but just left it loose enough to spin around the centred screw. The other 2 went right above the oven. Next I cut thin pieces of plywood as the top knob pieces, painted them black. Finally, these were glued right on to the knobs over top of each screw, allowing the whole thing to still turn.

After some research, he found Bodyweight Fitness (BWF) on Reddit. The support materials and videos are impressive. One of the great things about BWF is that it does not require weights. However, it does require a place to do a few exercises. I was surprised that I could not find a simple plan to build a gym for these exercises. So we decided to make one!\nMy goals in building this gym were:\n- Inexpensive (I went through several designs and kept simplifying them. Eight 2x4s and two 3 foot 1\" cast iron pipes along with fasteners are all you need)\n- Compact (my wife permitted me to put in our bedroom. We don't have a lot of space)\n- Easy to build and easy to use!\nThe total build time was about 3 hours. (Don't let all the steps fool you. The build was easy!)\nP.S. If you want to check out our one year challenge we have a website and blog that will be updated throughout the year here.

If one was noticeable longer than the other, then I corrected it as I opened it back up to about 90 degrees.\nI then took each side and bent them about 1/4\" away from the circle so the remaining parts were parallel, about the width of the base of a PEZ dispenser. At this point I held the clip flat, and bent each side down about 45 degrees about halfway down the remaining straight portion, then back up on the remaining portion closest to the ends.\nThe clips can be bent further once mounted, if they are not straight or parallel.

I cut 3/4\" plywood in strips at 1 3/4\" and screwed them onto strips at 3 1/2\", so that each tier was 1 3/4\" deep. The screw holes are 1 1/2\" back from the front of each tier, and 11/16\" in from the ends.

I predrilled all the screw holes before painting. That helped immensely.\n2. I chose to make a display case (not going into much detail in this instructable) that I could put glass sliding doors on, and the depth of the case I made allowed for 3 tiers. I put in 3 shelves, with the additional tiers removable on the top two shelves but fixed to the bottom shelf. I also made each tier piece only half the width of the shelves, so I could leave one or two out as desired to display other sorts of PEZ items that couldn't go into these stands. You can see in the first pic here the shelf goes straight across but there is a gap at the middle of the tier pieces. They just sit on the shelf with nothing fastening them. In the second pic you can see I left one out to show an example of how I could display other items by removing the tiers.\n3. I had originally meant to have each dispenser facing straight forward. However, after mounting several, I felt I got a better view of each back row if I turned them slightly to see a side profile. This meant that when I turned them to the right, only dispensers with narrow heads would fit all the way to the right side when placed in the case, as the larger heads would now bump into the sides of the case. Not a big deal, but if you were to do something similar you could adjust the distance in for the first hole in each row.\n4. Early on I thought I'd try to color coordinate each clip with the dispenser base. I gave up on this early on, as it would mean I'd have to move clips any time I'd buy a new PEZ dispenser. For instance, Garfield and Spongebob have so many variations of their dispensers, that if I found one I didn't have and kept them grouped together, I'd have to try to match the clip to the base and move a lot of stuff around.

I mean, It would take forever to hand sand each piece, and they are too small to use anything powered. Well, you put it back in the holes that the pieces came out of. Then you can sand without shooting them halfway through the drywall across the room (total dramatization, didn't happen,,, more than once). I used 220 grit sandpaper on a random orbital sander to do all of the sanding.\nNext was the stain. And here is where I once again made the mistake of trying to use poly-stain all-in-one crap.

Having your measure out equal amounts to make a cocktail to immunise them from zombies. We had 4 vials one being a trap of chilli so choose wisely. The others where vodka.

It will vary based on how thin you roll it out, but half of a silicone tube ends up being about 12 in by 18 in if you roll it thin enough.\nUse your hands to knead the silicone into a ball (make sure they are soapy first or it will stick to you), keep it in the water as much as possible to keep it from getting too sticky. When it's in a nice ball set it on your working surface (again, make sure it's soapy. To do this I just scoop a little water from the bowl and smear it around). Use your palm to make a depression in the middle and add some food coloring. If you want it really vibrant then you will have to add quite a bit because the dish soap kind of dilutes it.\nCarefully knead the color in; this part is a little awkward since the coloring has a tendency to drip off at first, but keep at it and you'll get it eventually. Note: I find it easiest to knead mostly in your hands rather than on the table, but do what works for you.\nOnce it's the color you want begin rolling it out on your prepared surface with a rolling pin that has been dipped in soapy water. Be sure to start with it in the center of the surface so it doesn't squish over the edge, unlike dough this is not easy to pick up and reposition.

First I did the basic frame out of plywood since balsa is to soft to handle a building of that size.

This was done with three pieces of forex, shish kebab sticks and toothpicks. That piece will be painted and then glued to the wall of the stable.\nNext, for the door you need more pieces of wood (I used balsa, but it turned out to be too soft, so use something else) to drill a hole through. The doors are balsa rectangulars and are just glued to the drilled pieces. Mind you, if you want your door to open and close you must glue every OTHER drilled piece to the beam of the door otherwise it won't be able to rotate on its' axis and therefore will not open. Or close, depends in which position you glue the pieces.\nThe roof needed to have an opening in it for the hay, of course. The construcion is really quite simple, four beams, a crossbeam and diagonal beams which really hold the structure together. Leave it to dry overnight. Next, add plywood to the roof and start tiling. When you leave the roof construcion to dry, you can prepare your carboard for tiles. Just calculate the surface of the roof, add an extra 20% for good measure and cut ot the needed amount of cardboard. I used carboard from frozen pizza packaging. Paint them with a large brush. Just run them over casually, you don't have to be precise. I used a tone of red and brown. Just put those two paints on the cardboard and rub them with a large paintbrush. Let dry.\nAfter everything is dry, cut the strips from your painted cardboard and then cut them to little pieces. Mine were approx. 10x15mm. Put them all in a container and mix them. I wanted to make the roof look like randomized tiles, but in the same tone. You will acheve that by really mixing the pieces. Next take one piece at the time and glue it on to the roof. Repeat. This is a long and repetetive process so have patience. Once you are done, you can coat the whole roof with a layer of PVA glue, just be sure that the glue is transparent when dry.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWA/S9D6/IX0PYFQL/FWAS9D6IX0PYFQL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAJ/SJHE/IX0PYEWC/FAJSJHEIX0PYEWC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE0/XWQO/IX0PYFGX/FE0XWQOIX0PYFGX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8T/KSLP/IX0PYF3J/F8TKSLPIX0PYF3J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY4/YDUZ/IX0PYF1T/FY4YDUZIX0PYF1T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCP/MM8H/IX0PYFA4/FCPMM8HIX0PYFA4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR4/R5IE/IX0PYFA3/FR4R5IEIX0PYFA3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH4/MEEM/IX0PYF6T/FH4MEEMIX0PYF6T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEO/ZOQH/IX0PYF7W/FEOZOQHIX0PYF7W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN0/G0CS/IX0PYFVN/FN0G0CSIX0PYFVN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSW/KXYD/IX0PYG3V/FSWKXYDIX0PYG3V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ2/KFP5/IX0PYGMR/FJ2KFP5IX0PYGMR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5X/0PL8/IX0PYGOC/F5X0PL8IX0PYGOC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDM/8753/IX0PYGTZ/FDM8753IX0PYGTZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTW/5MIA/IX0PYH4M/FTW5MIAIX0PYH4M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY7/59XD/IX0PYID2/FY759XDIX0PYID2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: The Stable/barn"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "I did most of the things simoultaneously since one part is getting dry, you can work on the other.

This version can work without the 10th piece because each one of the 9 pieces has 3 faces (one it's empty, the other one had the X, and the last one has the O).

Truly a fun game that fueled the imagination of many a kid in the 70s and 80s!\nLast year, I bought my kids an updated version of the game for them to enjoy. The game has been modernized, including a new game board that, while pretty, has been shrunk down such that the \"monster\" and \"treasure\" cards no longer fit inside of the rooms in the dungeon! Instead, when a monster is discovered, and/or takes your treasure, rather than leaving the monster/treasure cards in that room, you place a small number in the room, and drop the cards in a corresponding slot in a \"look-up table\" on one side of the game board. Kinda lame, and slows down the game unnecessarily. Surely the makers of \"Dungeon\" must have known that having to complicate the game was a risky sacrifice to make for shrinking the game board down to save a few cents on cardboard?!?\nTo correct this, I decided to enlarge the game board such that my kids could play the game by dropping cards into the dungeon rooms directly, without having to use the second-rate look-up table and place-holder numbers. As I researched options, I realized that if I'm going to go through the trouble of remaking a game board, why not really remake it, and represent the multi-level dungeon as a multi-level dungeon? That is, rather than represent the dungeon's six levels as a single \"floor plan\" like the original 2-D game board, why not build a six-level dungeon, with corridors, stairs, rooms, doors, and secret doors, more like a \"model\" of a dungeon?\nAs an Autodesk employee, I have access to the equipment at Pier 9 in San Francisco to help me fabricate one.

First, I broke the single model up into nine smaller models (3x3), each representing a section/level of the dungeon. The joints between these pieces followed the edges of the walls, so each of the nine pieces is irregular, and they fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. Then for each piece, I manually traced 2D contours at 1/4\" intervals (each plywood lamination is 1/4\" thick). There were 34 \"contour templates\" in all. Each \"contour template\" defined between one and 8 wood pieces to be laser-cut, depending on whether it represented a floor plate or horizontal slice through a wall section.\nFor each floor plate that is more than 2 contours thick, I hollowed out the middle contours, making each a \"ring\" preserving the contour edge but open in the middle to save on material and weight.\nThen I arrayed all the \"contour templates\" for each lamination, laying them all side-by-side in a single data file. Since my free version of SKP doesn't export to DWG, I contacted a friend who happily converted the geometry using SketchUp Pro. He sent me back a DWG file, complete with all 34 \"contour templates,\" that I could open in AutoCAD for final arrangement.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHM/CED7/IWWFLQNV/FHMCED7IWWFLQNV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: The Contour Templates"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "On a visit to San Francisco, I booked a day at Pier 9 to use their Epilog Laser Cutters. Having taken the training course a couple years earlier, I took a brief refresher with one of the instructors, who helped me determine that the best workflow was to save each \"contour template\" separately, with red lines for engraving linework and green lines for profile cuts. We then brought each file into Adobe Illustrator, made minor modifications to lineweights, and sent each \"contour template\" to the laser cutter. Pieces like floor plates that had linework engraved had to be sent in two passes: once for the linework, and a second time for the profile cuts.\nThe Epilog machines could handle 1/4\" plywood pieces 2'-0\" x 3'-0\", which means I could fit between 2 and 3 contour templates on a sheet. In all, I used 26 sheets of plywood with about 1/3 of it as \"off-cuts\" for recycling/re-use.\nLaser-cutting was s-l-o-w, and it took about 12 hours of cutting (feeding plywood, modifying and sending data, watching the machine cut, and carefully removing cut pieces, some of which were pretty fragile), which made for a pretty long day on my feet! Watching a laser cutter in action is a bit like watching grass grow, but the risk of a fire is too great to leave it unattended, so it's really time you have to put in when laser-cutting plywood.\nAt the end of the day, I had over 500 pieces of plywood to stack and arrange, but even \"dry fit\" the pieces began to take shape, and the scale of the entire dungeon became apparent: at 36\" x 42\" it is huge!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLI/5QEP/IWWFLQQ9/FLI5QEPIWWFLQQ9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F29/TEC1/IWWFLQGC/F29TEC1IWWFLQGC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCU/2HB8/IWWFLQQ8/FCU2HB8IWWFLQQ8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOG/MHT7/IWWFLQGF/FOGMHT7IWWFLQGF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Laser-Cutting"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "To get my 500+ pieces of plywood back home from San Francisco, I had to ship them via FedEx.

This wasn't bad, but since the original game board was so brightly color-coded to indicate each level of the dungeon, I decided to color the rooms as well before gluing the walls onto the floor plates.\nTo do this, I used cheap watercolor paints readily available in any craft/art store. For the first (top) dungeon level, I used a yellow wash. Second was orange, third was red (rose), fourth purple, fifth blue, and sixth green, just like the original gameboard coloring. I also tried to increase the value (darkness) of each level color, so the coloration got darker the lower you got into the dungeon (from pale yellow to dark green).\nI masked each room to keep paint pigment off the door thresholds and corridors. Unfortunately, the painter's tape did a poor job of masking watercolor wash on fresh plywood, so in some spots the colors bled across the threshold.

It's a warm grey/brown wash (cooler than the sides of the walls, but also paler and lighter to allow the wood grain to show through). I'm really pleased with the tone and finish that it produced, and brought a look of professionalism to the model that was lacking prior to the decision to stain the top surfaces.\nI was also pleased that the \"Watermark\" I engraved into the top surface continued to show through the stain, preserving its one-of-a-kind branding.

It would have probably been easier with nicer equipment, but it got the job done. The cutter works via the \"score and snap\" method. It can be difficult to cut all the way through glass without causing shattering or unwanted breaks, but if you etch a line into the glass and apply force on either side, there will be a controlled break along that line.\nTo cut glass, you apply pressure to the cutting wheel and pull the cutter along the line you want to break. You should hear a scratching sound. Then, apply force to either side, and if all goes well, the glass should break on the line. If the glass does not break right away, you can flip the glass over and try a new etch on the opposite side. You can also tap along the line with the ball on the end of the cutter to try to get a break started. In my experience, this leads to a less clean break, so it should be a last resort, but I found that it was sometimes necessary, especially to break off small pieces.\nWith my very limited experience with cutting glass, I initially thought it would be easiest to cut my big pane into small rectangles, then cut the corners off to form hexagons. This was both a terrible idea, and didn't work at all. I couldn't get the glass to break along my first score, and when I forced it, my glass broke along a curved path, which luckily only ruined some of my glass. Thankfully, I was working on the edge of the pane at the time, so most of the glass was left unscathed.\nSo, it was time to consult the internet. After doing some reading on the score and snap method, I learned that my initial attempt was destined for failure. When cutting glass, the closer you are to the center line of your glass, the easier and cleaner the snap will be. Not only that, but it becomes impossible to break off pieces that are close in size to the thickness of the glass.\nWhat I ended up doing was cutting my glass into quadrants, then cutting each quadrant in two. From there, I used my copy of Catan to trace hexagons onto the glass and etch along the lines. For each line I cut, I would trace my line using a permanent marker, then clamp a piece of wood to the glass. The purpose of the wood was to act as a straight edge, and the clamp helped it to stay in place while I etched my line (which gave me both hands free, and held the straight edge more steadily than I could have using my hands). This worked reasonably well, and I was able to get a lot of hexagons this way. I was able to get about 40 from my pane of glass, but I'm confident I could have gotten maybe as many as 60 if I had known at the start what I learned through the process. 40 was perfect for me, though, because I wanted to make 2 sets (19 tiles per set), and it was good to have a few extra in case of mistakes. Unfortunately, many of the hexagons had unclean breaks or sharp edges that needed to be fixed, so this was not the end of the job. It's important to cut your hexagons as close as possible to the correct size. You can grind down the edges, but it takes a very long time (or at least did for me).\nIf I had to do it again, I would do things slightly differently. It turned out that the easiest and cleanest breaks for hexagons occurred when I had a equilateral triangle and just had to break off the points. This also gives you some nice little triangles that can be used as ports.

This is where a tile grinder might come in handy, but all I had was my little rotary tool. After trying a few different grinding stone bits, it was obvious that this project would consume way too much time going that route. The stones ground away faster than the glass did. I ended up buying some diamond grinding bits, which worked much better.\nNote: When doing this, wear eye protection, gloves, and a mask. You don't want to be breathing in the glass dust.\nI also found that clamping down my rotary tool and holding the glass to the grinding bit worked very well. Holding the glass in one hand and the rotary tool in the other took much longer and tended to result in uneven edges. After many, many hours of grinding (and annoying my neighbors to no end, I'm sure... It's loud... ear protection may be a good idea.), I had all of my hexagons to the right size and with dull edges.\nAt this point, it's a good idea to test your tiles by laying them out as you would for a game. My tiles were not all identical, so there were some small gaps. The gaps are small enough, though, that they don't affect the gameplay, so I decided to call it good.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFI/ZFN3/IWMFD4SF/FFIZFN3IWMFD4SF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Fine Tuning the Hexagons"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "I don't really care for painting, so this part was more of a chore than anything else, but the results were worth it. The painting needs to take place in two steps. First, apply the pattern to the glass with liquid leading. This keeps your colors separate and gives your tiles that authentic stained glass look. I first drew my patterns on paper, then put my tiles over the drawings so that I could trace rather than free hand. I found most of my patterns by just doing an image search, but made some adaptations to them so that they would be easier to draw on small tiles. There are 3 stone, 3 brick, 4 wood, 4 wheat, 4 sheep, and 1 desert tiles. I also used some triangles left over from when I was cutting glass for harbors. There are 9 harbors, 1 for each resource, and 4 wild-card.\nThe bottle of liquid leading that comes with the paint kit that I got had a nozzle that supposedly allowed for the application of designs directly from the bottle. Doing that clearly takes a lot more finesse than I am capable of, so I had to come up with some other way. I found that a syringe with a metal applicator tip worked nicely. Using that, I could control the flow very well, and the metal tip had a small enough opening that I could do reasonably intricate designs. I'm not sure where you would purchase something like this... We use these where I work, so I was able to use one of the extras.\nOnce you've applied the leading to the tile, it has to dry at least 8 hours before adding the other paints. Color them to your hearts desire. I used the tool that came with the paints to scoop paint onto the tile, then pushed it around with the back end of the tool. Lay on the paint pretty heavy. It lightens up considerably once it is dry. I don't think you are supposed to use brush, but I didn't try, so I couldn't speak to that. Once they're painted, wait 24 hours to dry.\nA final step that turned out to be pretty important is to seal the stained glass with an acrylic sealer. The paint I used is meant to be washable, so I was worried that the paint would easily rub off if I didn't seal it. I just used a cheap spray acrylic sealer, and it worked nicely.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FW9/6IXH/IWGPIDR2/FW96IXHIWGPIDR2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM6/BLLC/IWGPIDR3/FM6BLLCIWGPIDR3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV0/PWC2/IWGPIDW1/FV0PWC2IWGPIDW1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGF/K438/IWMFD4MF/FGFK438IWMFD4MF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4V/BKYQ/IWGPIE0Z/F4VBKYQIWGPIE0Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPZ/KTDJ/IWGPIE10/FPZKTDJIWGPIE10.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOF/N9YK/IWGPIE60/FOFN9YKIWGPIE60.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4J/A4DZ/IWMFD4KH/F4JA4DZIWMFD4KH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO7/BCUX/IWMFD6NI/FO7BCUXIWMFD6NI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKL/94HZ/IWMFD6NW/FKL94HZIWMFD6NW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEQ/AQ5Q/IWMFD8T9/FEQAQ5QIWMFD8T9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOA/XRCE/IWMFD7EN/FOAXRCEIWMFD7EN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK5/B45O/IWMFD7F9/FK5B45OIWMFD7F9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLE/9VFO/IWMFD7FO/FLE9VFOIWMFD7FO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9P/A8H4/IWMFD7KR/F9PA8H4IWMFD7KR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVI/D0J9/IWMFD7MS/FVID0J9IWMFD7MS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFD/75F7/IWMFD7OV/FFD75F7IWMFD7OV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU7/IQ2S/IWMFD7QY/FU7IQ2SIWMFD7QY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F48/2NZA/IWMFD7R6/F482NZAIWMFD7R6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7Y/1BWY/IWMFD7S6/F7Y1BWYIWMFD7S6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F78/VWVM/IWMFD7UU/F78VWVMIWMFD7UU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA8/MZMA/IWMFD7XB/FA8MZMAIWMFD7XB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0K/R5C7/IWMFD4RU/F0KR5C7IWMFD4RU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3Y/840G/IWQVD0PJ/F3Y840GIWQVD0PJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FER/6H4E/IWMFD4RC/FER6H4EIWMFD4RC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQW/M5DZ/IWMFD4QD/FQWM5DZIWMFD4QD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU2/048B/IWQVD108/FU2048BIWQVD108.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAI/EJTX/IWQVD12G/FAIEJTXIWQVD12G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0Z/CNNI/IWQVD0X1/F0ZCNNIIWQVD0X1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F44/7C1Q/IWQVD13E/F447C1QIWQVD13E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUA/HC2Z/IWQVD0Y6/FUAHC2ZIWQVD0Y6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBX/GC42/IWQVD0TM/FBXGC42IWQVD0TM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS1/HZKY/IWQVD0UO/FS1HZKYIWQVD0UO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Painting"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "At this point, your tiles are pretty much ready to go. The problem is, they look much better when light is shining through them than they do when just sitting on a table. Solution: Build a base with a surface that lights up.\nFirst, you need a design. To that end, I laid out my tiles on a big piece of paper as they would be during a game and traced around the edge with a pencil. Then, because the wood that I chose to use was 1/2\" thick, I measured 1/2\" out and drew lines so that I had the outline of my base. Originally, I wanted to make it so that the wood was immediately next to the glass at all points, but after tracing that out, it looked like more work than I was willing to put in. Instead, I decided to leave a little extra space next to the harbors so that there would be fewer cuts to make. Once I had this design, I marked where the joints would be so that I could see the size and shape of the pieces I had to cut.\nEven though my tiles weren't perfect hexagons and so didn't lay out perfectly symmetrically, I wanted my base to be symmetric. For my design, this meant that I would only need 3 types of pieces, with 6 of 2 types and 3 of the third. In my drawing, I measured the lengths of every piece of the same type and averaged them together to get the length to cut.\nNow that that's out of the way, it's time to get out the miter saw. My design is nice in that you can set the saw at 30 deg and leave it there for every cut. Most of the cuts are 30 deg, but there are a few that are 60 deg, for which you just hold the wood perpendicular to the guard instead of parallel. See the pictures for more details.\nNext, the pieces need to be glued together to form the frame of the base. If you're like me, you don't have fancy clamps that can hold wood together at an angle. Instead, I used both wood glue and hot glue. The hot glue dries very quickly and holds the wood together while the wood glue dries much more slowly, but creates a stronger bond. It's a good idea to set your wood out in the appropriate layout and glue one piece at a time so that it comes together correctly.\nAfter the glue has dried, you can use the wood frame to trace out plywood to close up one side. On the other side will be some frosted plastic, so it is a good idea to trace out the design on that as well before you seal up the bottom with your plywood. Use a jig saw to cut out the design from the plywood, then glue it into your frame. I wanted it to be as close as possible to flat, so I used some textbooks to hold it down while the glue dried.\nBefore too long, we'll be adding some lights to the base, so now is also a good time to drill a hole for the jack that will supply power to the lights. At this point, everything that will be visible when the base is complete is finished, so you should stain the wood before proceeding any further.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ6/JSN3/IWMFD6KX/FQ6JSN3IWMFD6KX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBT/F7CU/IWMFD60S/FBTF7CUIWMFD60S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGO/TQRY/IWMFD618/FGOTQRYIWMFD618.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFE/YJVM/IWMFD62D/FFEYJVMIWMFD62D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPR/AB5S/IWMFD6IS/FPRAB5SIWMFD6IS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLW/WMOX/IWMFD6HK/FLWWMOXIWMFD6HK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ5/JH9X/IWMFD6J8/FJ5JH9XIWMFD6J8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRT/LUN0/IWMFD6I5/FRTLUN0IWMFD6I5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDI/YSMH/IWMFD5Q5/FDIYSMHIWMFD5Q5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F77/L6GZ/IWMFD6IJ/F77L6GZIWMFD6IJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F10/D0PR/IWMFD5I7/F10D0PRIWMFD5I7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRV/8TNS/IWMFD6JN/FRV8TNSIWMFD6JN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4K/NASG/IWMFD5O4/F4KNASGIWMFD5O4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLY/9EY5/IWMFD5QK/FLY9EY5IWMFD5QK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIQ/KZTO/IWMFD604/FIQKZTOIWMFD604.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4S/51X6/IWMFD5ST/F4S51X6IWMFD5ST.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRI/BRMI/IWMFD6OO/FRIBRMIIWMFD6OO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJS/AYXT/IWMFD6PB/FJSAYXTIWMFD6PB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBK/01QQ/IWMFD6PQ/FBK01QQIWMFD6PQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJH/U754/IWMFD72E/FJHU754IWMFD72E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F83/WLRK/IWMFD6QQ/F83WLRKIWMFD6QQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Making a Base"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "The top of the wood base will be frosted plastic that is lit from underneath so that you have a bright surface on which to put your stained glass tiles. Before you glued the plywood into your frame, you should have traced the inside of the frame onto the plastic that you will be using. I had a 42\" LED TV that someone had thrown away which I tore apart for parts. Between the backlight and LCD, there is a thin but rigid piece of frosted plastic that was perfect for this purpose.\nThis plastic was a bit brittle, so it was difficult to cut without cracking it. I made two different bases about a week apart, and after the first time didn't go as well as I would like, I tried a different method. For the first base, I used my rotary tool with a cutting wheel. This did not work very well, because rather than cutting through the plastic, it kind of just melted it. It did get the job done, though, and I think if I had better cutting wheels, it would have worked a little better. The second method I tried was very similar to cutting glass. I used a utility knife to start a controlled crack through the plastic, then gently broke it apart along that crack. This ended up looking better than when I used the rotary tool, but required a lot more care, and I still had a few stray cracks that I had to seal up with superglue.\nBefore you put the plastic in place, you need to mount your lights and put supports in place to hold up the plastic.\nI had some 12 V LED strips that I wasn't using any longer that worked great for the lighting. I mounted a female barrel jack (2.1 x 5.5 mm) adaptor (with wires already connected) in the hole drilled in the last step and secured it with lots of hot glue (I'm sure there are better methods, but that's what I had at the time). Then, I strung the LED around the edge of the frame so that the LED's point toward the center of the base (not up). By doing this, I hoped to achieve more even lighting without bright spots, and it seemed to work pretty well.\nTo hold up the plastic piece, I cut up a 1/2\" wooden dowel that I had laying around into 2\" lengths. Then, I glued them (using the same hot glue-wood glue combination) to the plywood that forms the bottom of the base. My arrangement was pretty much random, and as long as they are more-or-less evenly distributed, it should work well. Once the glue dries, put the plastic on top.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHB/5NWY/IWMFD6KB/FHB5NWYIWMFD6KB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ2/PS8X/IWMFD6SD/FQ2PS8XIWMFD6SD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFG/TVQ6/IWMFD6V0/FFGTVQ6IWMFD6V0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7B/L272/IWMFD6Z3/F7BL272IWMFD6Z3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHE/O6R6/IWMFD6ZP/FHEO6R6IWMFD6ZP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWU/N3N9/IWMFD71T/FWUN3N9IWMFD71T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWG/44N6/IWMFD714/FWG44N6IWMFD714.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM4/9G3N/IWMFD705/FM49G3NIWMFD705.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI3/DGU3/IWMFD740/FI3DGU3IWMFD740.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5P/S7BP/IWMFD73U/F5PS7BPIWMFD73U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9C/0HUD/IWMFD769/F9C0HUDIWMFD769.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKR/PXAF/IWMFD76V/FKRPXAFIWMFD76V.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Light It Up!"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "For the most part, you want to be displaying a work of art such as this, but for the rare occasions when you need to store it, you want something safe so that the glass tiles do not break.

A capture can only occur if you add the pips (dots on dice) on the dice that are being captured and they add up to 6 or less.

If you are playing your piece on a white space, you can only capture from the 4 (or less) adjacent colored spaces. If you capture by placing your piece on a colored space, you can only capture from the adjacent white spaces.\n\nNon-capturing move: all non-capturing moves can be played in any empty space on the board.

The playfield is purely custom, but the shot lines (such as the curve of the back looping shot) were designed based on real pinball machines to ensure smooth play. One difficulty here is that, due to their complexity, the actual pinball parts (e.g. the bumpers and the drop targets) were not modeled, but care still has to be taken to ensure that everything will fit underneath the playfield - the parts are much larger underneath than above.\nThe files are included in the repository, so feel free to adjust the design to suit your fancy.\nA few highlights of the design:\nThe playfield is 42\u201d by 20.25\u201d inches, exactly the size of 1980\u2019s Bally-style games. It is made of \u00bd\u201d plywood, which is standard and should not be changed as the pinball part assemblies are designed for this thickness. The walls here consist of a \u00bd\u201d layer on top of a \u00bc\u201d layer. In the first prototype, only \u00bd\u201d walls were included, but these proved to be too short and could pop the pinball into the air on particularly firm shots. Secondly, this design allows for slightly raised shooter line (pictured above) which allows the ball to drop slightly into the playfield, but not fall back in.\nThe ramp is designed with clear acrylic and 3d-printed supports. It crosses the playfield so that it gives the player the opportunity to hit the ramp multiple times in a row from the left flipper. As such, clear acrylic is used to not obstruct the player\u2019s view of the table:\nFinally, the playfield is supported by short walls at the four corners, which keep the playfield at the standard 6.5 degrees of slope. The back wall has a bottom \u201cshelf\u201d that can be removed and is used to mount the electronics. This results in a game with a full-size playfield, but is much more compact than a typical game and can be carried by hand by one person. Since the playfield is a standard size, however, these supports can be removed if you want to place the playfield into a standard pinball cabinet. To do so, you may want to consider adding a ball return assembly, which is not included in this design.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FI3/VWFO/IWMR25UO/FI3VWFOIWMR25UO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ9/4Z4A/IWMR25X6/FJ94Z4AIWMR25X6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8D/Y85N/IWMR25VK/F8DY85NIWMR25VK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Design"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "To cut the layers of the playfield, we used a laser cutter. However, a laser cutter powerful enough to cut \u00bd\u201d plywood is hard to find, requires high-quality plywood, and can risk starting a fire if you\u2019re not careful. Typical playfields are cut using a CNC router - while some of the corners might not be as crisp, you should still achieve decent results. For simplicity, the steps below will assume you have access to the same laser cutter we did. There are some people who have had decent results using only a drill and jigsaw, but you must be very careful and very patient if you go this route.\nThe first step in creating the playfield is converting the design into .DXF files that can be fed into a laser cutter. For example, the playfield .DXF file is pictured below. The files used in this project are included in our repository.\nUsing the laser cutter, we cut out shapes for the playfield, the \u00bc\u201d intermediate layer (we used duron, a cheaper wood-like prototyping material, but \u00bc\u201d plywood will also work), the \u00bd\u201d top layer, and the \u00bd\u201d supports.\nMaterials needed:\n\u00bd\u201d plywood for the playfield and base\n\u00bc\u201d plywood or duron for the intermediate wall layer\n\u00bd\u201d, \u00be\u201d, and 1\u201d wood screws\nAccess to a CNC router or laser cutter", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCS/E80C/IWMR25VH/FCSE80CIWMR25VH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNQ/DE1O/IWMR25U2/FNQDE1OIWMR25U2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Cut the Wood"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Begin by clamping the pieces from the \u00bc\u201d duron layer onto the plywood in their respective locations. Using a hand-drill, first drill pilot holes using a 3/32\u201d bit, and then use flat-head \u00be\u201d wood screws to attach the \u00bc\u201d layer to the playfield It is important to do this from the top-down (i.e. so that the screw first goes through the \u00bc\u201d layer, then into the \u00bd\u201d base), since the \u00bc\u201d parts are small and thin and will bend away from the base layer if drilled in the opposite direction. It is also important to make sure the screw heads are flush with the \u00bc\u201d layer and don\u2019t provide any additional thickness.\nOne final note: these screws can go almost anywhere, as this layer will be mostly invisible to the player once the playfield is assembled. But there is an exception -- don\u2019t put screws into the shooter lane. (We initially made this mistake).\nNext, attach the side walls, and use the longest wood screws to drill into them from the top of the board, again such that the screw heads are flush with the top. Once that is done, clamp the \u00bd\u201d layer pieces on top of the duron, and screw them in as before, except this time screwing in from the bottom using 1\" screws. Since the top layer is \u00bd\u201d thick, it is less likely to bend away from the base, and screwing from the bottom ensures that the screws stay invisible to the player.\nFinally, attach the shooter block (pictured above, with shooter) by screwing in from the bottom side using 2 screws so the block cannot easily twist. The shooter block has a \"U\"-shaped slot that fits the shooter, which can be installed by tightening the nut on the other side. You may also have to use lubricant to reduce the friction between the shooting rod and the ball.\nThe design may need some adjustments at this point. For example, in our design, the cut for the drop targets was too narrow and had to be expanded using a dremel. If using our files as more than a reference, do try to contact the authors who might be able to provide updated files. It is also a good idea to sand down any rough areas, particurarily where two wood pieces meet.\nFor the most part, this concludes the woodworking, and we can move to putting in components.\nMaterials needed:\n3/4\" flat head wood screws\nShooter assembly\nLonger (~1.5\") wood screws\nHand drill with 3/32\" bit\nLubricating oil\n1\" flat head wood screws\nA file and/or dremel, and sandpaper", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCV/5KA3/IWMR25W1/FCV5KA3IWMR25W1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ4/PHPV/IWMR25V7/FZ4PHPVIWMR25V7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCK/2B45/IWQUU19I/FCK2B45IWQUU19I.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Assemble the Playfield"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "By this point in the design stage, you should have a general idea of the orientation required to make sure all the components actually fit underneath the playfield. (If using our design, reference the picture of the underside of our table above).\nFirst, install the drop targets, stand-up target, and slingshot assemblies by putting \u00bd\u201d wood screws through the mounting holes in the assembly. Do the same with the pop bumpers, but make sure to remove the cap first, or the assembly won\u2019t fit into its hole!\nSecond, install the flipper assemblies. Make sure that they rotate in the correct direction. The solenoid, when fired, will pill the pin into the coil, and this should rotate the shaft such that the flipper rotates up towards the playfield. Once the flipper assemblies are installed, attach the flipper bats in from the other side. Use a wrench on the lock nut in the assembly to tighten them into place, then use the spring that should come with the assembly to make sure the flippers are bulled back down when not being fired.\nSimilarly, install all the rollover switches using the 1/2\" screws, ensuring that they can be easily pressed in from the top and spring back into place. Using the 6-32 bolts, also attach the gate switch at the top-left of our design. This gate switch also serves as a one-way opening, which allows shots from the right side and from the shooter to fall into the bumpers. This is a design aspect that results in shots entering the right ramp and right loop going to different places and adds more variety to the play.\nTo install the lights, first place the plastic inserts into their holes. These inserts are about \u00bc\u201d thick. If using a CNC router, the proper way to mount these is to cut a \u00bc\u201d layer slightly larger than the insert hole. In our design, since the laser cutter cannot cut partial layers, we 3D-printed brackets that support the inserts. Use epoxy to hold the inserts into place (roughen the edges first) and the sandpaper to make sure the inserts are level with the playfield.\nNext, insert the LEDS into their brackets by inserting and twisting them into place. Then, screw the brackets into place such that these LEDs sit directly below each insert. The light brackets linked below are pretty thin, and actually thin enough that the 1/2\" screws may pierce the top of the table. Use a couple of washers so that this doesn't happen.\nThe playfield posts are installed using the 6-32 bolts. Once installed, wrap rubbers from the rubber kit around them to make passive bumpers. These give the table a lot more \u201clife\u201d than if the design were to be completely plywood. Using the same bolts, attach the lane guides just above the flippers. Also glue the end-of-game switch into place.\nNote that most games have a dedicated ball return assembly like the one here. This was not included in this design, however, primarily due to cost. The trade-off, of course, is that the player is now responsible for placing the ball back into the shooter lane once it drains. We do have a shooter, though, which is attached to the shooter block as pictured earlier.\nThe flipper buttons and start button are installed by placing them into the holes and locking into place with palnuts. The flipper button leaf switches are bolted inside the buttons using 6-32 bolts and will close a switch circuit when the buttons are pressed.\nAt this point, your playfield will (from above) resemble a nearly-complete pinball table! All that is missing is the ramp. Feel free to gloat among your friends about how awesome it looks while privately being frightened about how much wiring and soldering there is to do.\nMaterials needed (the majority were purchased from PinballLife.com, and can be found simply by searching the terms below).\n1 3-bank drop target assembly\n3x pop bumper assembly\n1 left flipper assembly\n1 right flipper assembly\n2 flipper bats\n2 flipper buttons\n2 flipper button palnuts\n1 start button\n1 rubber ring set\n~30 playfield star posts, (1 1/16\" used)\n2 lane guides\n2 flipper button leaf switches\n2 slingshot assemblies\n1 standup target\n10 rollover switches\n8 LED #44 bayonet-style lights\n8 bayonet-style light brackets (Miniature Bayonet Base 2-Lead Socket With Long Mounting Bracket)\n5 1-1/2\" x 13/16\" blue arrow insert\n3 1\" x 3/4\" clear bullet insert\n6-32 bolts (2.5\", as well as some smaller sizes), nuts, and washers\n~2\" wide gate switch (like the one here, this may be hard to find, we scrapped ours from an old broken pinball ramp purchased on ebay)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8B/26SO/IWQUUAJ6/F8B26SOIWQUUAJ6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ1/B5K5/IWMR25VT/FQ1B5K5IWMR25VT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVZ/YEZU/IWMR25VD/FVZYEZUIWMR25VD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCE/604F/IWMR25Y9/FCE604FIWMR25Y9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG8/QY30/IWMR25W6/FG8QY30IWMR25W6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3N/LME4/IWMR25UF/F3NLME4IWMR25UF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG7/FVYA/IWMR25V3/FG7FVYAIWMR25V3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFZ/OR47/IWQUU9R2/FFZOR47IWQUU9R2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Add the Components"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "To make the ramp, use \u00bc\u201d acrylic for the base pieces and \u215b\u201d acrylic for the side walls. The clear acrylic will give a nice, clean appearance while not blocking the view of the playfield for the player. Using colored acrylic might also be a nice-looking option, but it is not recommended to use a completely opaque material like wood.\nThe supports for the ramps are 3D printed using a makerbot and bolted to the playfield and the plastic using the same 6-32 bolts.\nThe acrylic pieces here are glued together using acrylic cement, which is a solvent that essentially melts and welds the plastic together. Make sure to use a small amount, and it will make a very strong bond that is almost invisible.\nAt the entrance of the ramp, we have included a ramp flap like the one in the picture above. This is a thin piece of metal that gives a very smooth transition from the playfield to the plastic of the ramp, rather than having the pinball have to \u201cjump\u201d up the \u00bc\u201d thickness of the plastic. You can buy one of these cheaply from a pinball specialty store or Ebay (we did), or just make one of your own out of sheet metal. In commercial games, these are riveted so that the bolts do not stick up and get in the way of the ball. Since we did not have the proper equipment to do that, we made sure to use flat-head screws and properly chamfer out a hole in the plastic and in the metal to achieve the same effect.\nThere is a narrow gate switch attached to the 3D supports on the front-right corner of the ramp, where it turns to go across the playfield.

I'd recommend using 35V or lower with these electronics, or using a more professional control board resource like the ones listed here: http://pinballmakers.com/wiki/index.php/Construction)\nThis machine has 3 voltage levels: 48V for the solenoid power, 6.3V for the LEDs, and 5V for the logic and sound. To provide these voltage levels, we used a CNC power supply for the 48V, and off-the-shelf DC adapters to provide the 6.3V and the 5V. (It could be possible to just use the 6.3V, as the Arduino down-regulates its supply voltage to its 5V output pin, but we kept those power supplies isolated). 48V is a high voltage, and while not deadly by itself can be damaging to parts and can quickly cause components to overheat if there are any problems with the circuitry. Use a 5-A slow-blow fuse on both the input and the output of the main 48V power supply to avoid starting a fire if any of the transistors short.\nOn the Arduino shield, we attached wires with female Molex connectors designed that matched the input and output requirements of each of the three sub-boards: the solenoid driver board, the lights/sound driver board, and the input board.\nIn our design, we had the following pin assignments.

Since the signals are at the 5V level and the solenoids at 48V, hefty power MOSFETS are necessary to relay the signal. The transistors used in this design are these 100V-rated MOSFETs from Mouser.\nThere are three schematics pictured above, which includes the flippers, the slingshots, and the bumpers/drop targets. Each has slightly different requirements, but in all of them, when the transistor is given a 5V signal, a current path opens for the solenoid and 5-8 amps are pushed through the coil to give a powerful kick. This is a lot of current! In fact, this much current will burn out the components if the transistor is kept on for more than a very brief pulse. Make sure, in testing this circuit using software or other methods, to never fully power a solenoid for more than about a second.\nThe main source of problems in the above circuitry is inductive kick. The solenoids are powerful inductors, and as you may know, the current in inductors cannot change instantaneously. As such, when the transistor is turned-off, there is still a brief moment where 5-8 amps is flowing through the solenoid, and all that current needs somewhere to go. If not given a path to ground, this current will drive the voltage at the transistor drain up to hundreds of volts and destroy the transistor. Furthermore, when the transistor is destroyed, it shorts all three terminals, which causes amps of continuous current to flow and can destroy the solenoid if there isn\u2019t a proper fuse installed. (We destroyed 8 transistors in our discovery and attempts to deal with this problem, but fortunately no solenoids since we were always quick to manually disconnect the power).\nThere are two methods to prevent inductive kick: first, each pinball assembly should come with a diode that points from the transistor drain back up to the supply. This, in theory, should prevent the transistor drain from ever exceeding the supply voltage, as once that happens the diode will turn on and drain all the remaining energy from the inductor. Unfortunately, in reality these diodes alone do not turn on fast enough to suppress the inductive kick enough by themselves.\nTo solve the problem, we added an RC \u2018snubber\u2019 circuit. This circuit features a capacitor in series with a resistor. The capacitor absorbs enough current from the inductor such that the diode has time to turn on and perform its function. For more info on RC snubber circuits, check here.\nThe bumper/droptarget solenoid driver circuit is fairly simple and has just the transistor, the solenoid, the snubber, and a connection to receive the input from the Arduino. In this board and subsequent boards, make sure to wire the solenoid such that the diode (which is not shown in the schematic) points towards the high voltage side.\nThe flipper driver circuit is a bit more complicated for three reasons. First, in order to have a fast reaction between the button press and the flipper action, it is recommended to create that response directly in the circuitry rather than as separate inputs and outputs handled by the Arduino. The delay caused by the Arduino is small, but an experienced player will be able to tell immediately and will be frustrated by the lack of control.\nSecondly, the flippers feature two different coils (a low-power and a high-power coil) an end-of-stroke switch which triggers when the flipper is high. This switch serves the important function of allowing the high power coil to fire initially to give a powerful stroke, but switching to the low power coil (~130 ohms vs. 4 ohms) that gives enough power to keep the flipper held \u2018up\u2019 as long as the button is placed, but does not draw so much current as to burn out the solenoid. In the picture below, the EOS switch is normally closed, but our assembly had a normally-open switch and necessitated another transistor to convert that into a normally-closed signal.\nThirdly, while we wanted the button to control the flippers directly, we also included a \u2018master\u2019 switch signal from the Arduino that could activate or deactivate the flippers depending on whether the ball was in play. This results in the use of the third transistor in the circuit.\nSimilarly, the slingshot board has its own complications. While it uses just one transistor, it, like the flippers, should be controlled directly by the input switches (which we wired in series) for a fast response as well as to not require additional output pins on the Arduino. Unfortunately, if the gate of the transistor is connected to the switch directly, the response is far too fast to have more than a barely-noticeable kick since the switch does not stay closed for very long. In order to have a more powerful kick (i.e. letting the slingshot solenoid \"follow through\"), we added a diode and a large resistor at the gate of the transistors, which allows for a quick response but creates a large time constant of voltage decay at that node so that the gate remains close to 5V (and the transistor on) long enough to have a noticeable kick, even after the slingshot switches have been re-opened. Another complication is sending this input to the Arduino, as the input board (as we will see later) requires low inputs, and the slingshot operates when an input is pushed high. To solve this problem, we included a third transistor that closes whenever either input goes high, and thus can be treated like any other input switch on the playfield\nThe driver board (actually two boards) consists of two flipper drivers, two slingshot drivers, and four single-switch drivers for the remaining solenoids. Rather than soldering directly, we used 0.1\u201d molex connectors to attach this board to the solenoids, power supply, and switches, so that any repairs or adjustments could be more easily made.\nWe used solderable breadboards for our designs, but designing actual PCBs with these functions would have a much cleaner result and help mitigate the mess of wires that these machines inevitably have.\nMaterials:\n12 100V-rated power transistors\n10-50 uF capacitors (nonpolar if possible)\n300, 5k, and 500k, and 3M resistors\n1 smaller transistor for slingshot switch\nSeveral 1N4004 diodes\nPrototype solderable breadboards (or, even better, design your own PCBs)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FK5/RSWS/IWMR23I3/FK5RSWSIWMR23I3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYK/XVI8/IWMR23MB/FYKXVI8IWMR23MB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQW/4HV3/IWMR23NZ/FQW4HV3IWMR23NZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBS/FMWV/IWMR2ACI/FBSFMWVIWMR2ACI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB0/ZYDF/IWMR25U7/FB0ZYDFIWMR25U7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYA/R2J6/IWMR23ID/FYAR2J6IWMR23ID.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUH/4WNV/IWQUUISU/FUH4WNVIWQUUISU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Make the Driver Boards"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Since we are using just an Arduino, we are limited to 20 digital pins. The pinball machine, however, has a few dozen unique switch inputs, not to mention outputs needed for lights, sound, and driving solenoids. To alleviate this problem, we made the assumption that no two inputs would be triggered at once (thereby limiting us to only using 1 ball). This assumption allows us to \u2018encode\u2019 the switch inputs by converting them into a 5-bit binary register with a 6th pin that triggered an interrupt whenever a valid switch input was received. To accomplish this, we used a cascade of 8-to-3 encoders to make a 24-to-5 encoder using this encoder in the layout shown in the pictures above.\nThis was one of the most important developments of the project, as it allowed us to greatly increase the complexity of our machine from our initial plan of just having flippers, bumpers, and one or two targets.\nA second prototype board was used to place each of the 24 male Molex connectors; each switch on the playfield would have a female connector at the end of a long wire that plugs into this board. The drop targets are a unique case that can be handled in several ways. What we did was wire each drop target switch in series, so that the input is closed when they are all down and allows the Arduino to send a signal to the solenoid to fire the drop targets back up.\nMaterials:\n4 3-state-output priority 8-to-3 encoders", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFD/TJQ9/IWMR25VG/FFDTJQ9IWMR25VG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGU/R213/IWMR23MZ/FGUR213IWMR23MZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Make the Sensor Input Board"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "To save pins in a similar manner to the encoder, we used a 3-to-8 decoder to control our lights. This provided us with the limitation that we could not light more than one light at any one time, but that was an acceptable tradeoff to free up the pins for other elements. We also included a 4th \u201cmaster\u201d light output that could control all of the lights at once. This, for example, could allow us to flash all the lights several times when the game is first turned on (giving a strong indication that something is actually happening to the player when he or she presses the start button, which is otherwise difficult without a ball trough or colorful display).\nThe above schematic features a transistor circuit similar to the drivers, but much simpler as the lower voltages in play (6.3V for the lights) need smaller transistors and do not necessitate as much protection circuitry. We used a diode OR gate for the transistors to isolate the master switch signal and the individual light signal. This allows us to use only one transistor per light instead of two, and prevents the Arduino and the encoder chips from \u2018fighting\u2019 to source or sink current.\nWhile we used low-current LEDs for each of the playfield lights (the ones underneath inserts), the start button and the 3 pop bumpers each came with incandescent bulbs that draw about 250mA each. The transistors are rated for 530mA of continuous current, so to not exceed this, we made sure that only two incandescent ever went through a single transistor.\nWe also attached a passive 5V piezo buzzer that allows us to play rudimentary sounds to this board.\nCustom light and sound sequences can be programmed using functions light_sequence + sound_sequence or through the Pinball Language interface.\n10 lighting transistors (we used these)\n5V Piezo buzzer", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FA2/IDDU/IWMR2ACJ/FA2IDDUIWMR2ACJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGN/X1MC/IWMR23LP/FGNX1MCIWMR23LP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Make the Light/sound/score Peripheral Board"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "There are two options for defining the rules of the pinball game.

This could be because the customizable game had a lot of general-purpose functions which required conditional statements. This slowed down the read speed of the loop, which caused us to miss several interrupts and affected the overall operating speed of the game. To solve this problem, we reduced some of the customizability of the config file game in order to achieve acceptable response times in the circuit. We originally had concerns about the RAM capacity of the Arduino and how much of the game rules it could store, but this turned out to be less of a problem than originally expected and it was the speed of the loop that was the bigger limiting factor.\nDebouncing interrupts - because of the quick actions of the pinball game, we had several cases during which the interrupt pin was receiving several interrupts for the pinball hitting only one game component. Additionally, because these interrupts were received before the encoder had time to correctly read all inputs, the interrupts would be linked to incorrect components. To solve this problem, we used an external debouncing library which responds 1ms after the first interrupt is received, giving time for the encoder pins to reach high before the game reads the input code.\nDisplay - Although serial display allows for the game to print out detailed messages, it\u2019s hard for a player to read the output messages when playing a fast-paced game of pinball. It\u2019s also unwieldy for the player to have to play the game with a computer attached.

There are a lot of wires, so be careful! Follow the layout given in Electronic Pins and Layout to connect your Arduino outlets to their corresponding pins. Molex connectors should help a lot in figuring out which connectors connect with which.\nHere is a short troubleshooting FAQ in case you run into any of the common problems we did:\nNone of the inputs are being recorded by the Arduino!\nThe nature of the input encoder is that there are 6 input pins into the Arduino: 5 which together show which input is triggered, and a 6th pin that goes high if any single input is triggered. The code written only detects when this sixth pin changes from low to high. So if the Arduino is not receiving any inputs, and you are sure that all or at least most of the switches work, check to see if any switches are stuck closed. For example, if all the drop targets are down and haven't been fired back up, that is a closed switch and prevents the Arduino from receiving any other inputs.\nThe shooter is really weak!\nCheck to sure that the nut that holds the shooter in place is tightened fully, or that the shooter block isn't loose. Alternatively, oil the shooter rod.\nCertain inputs, like rollovers, aren't always being recorded\nThis can be a mechanical/design problem if the switches are placed in too wide a lane, allowing the ball to go 'around' them. Otherwise, it can be the result of too long of a delay somewhere in the code. If, for example, you are busy playing a tone using the tone library and a delay() statement, the Arduino will not be able to pick up inputs during that time. One workaround we used was to only play sounds for the ramp shot, standup target, start button, and end-of-game switch, as we knew about how much time we would have after these shots before a new input was likely to be triggered.\nThe wrong bumper fires when the ball is switched! OR The wrong lights go on!\nAdmittedly, we did not assign specific headers for specific lights or specific solenoids, meaning that the first time you plug everything in (or subsequent times if you don't label them somehow), the output pins (or output light encoding) are connected in arbitrary order. Use trial-and-error to resolve which pins correspond to which output and adjust the code accordingly. For the lights and bumpers, this isn't so bad -- but definitely label all the inputs and write down which is which, as that process can have up to 24 values and will take a bit longer to calibrate.\nThe inputs are fine when I press them, but sometimes are wrong during play?\nThe encoder has the unfortunate property of sometimes pulsing the indicator pin high before the 5 encoder pins have fully resolved their values. For us, we knew this had occurred when the number of the switch being pressed was off-by-one, but it may show up differently for you. We solved this problem by using a debouncing library to create a tiny bit of delay between when we notice that a switched has changed and when we record which switch it was. Careful, though, as too much of a delay (more than 15-20mS) can cause you to miss inputs entirely.\nThere are so so many wires and I can't keep them all organized please help\nSorry, but we haven't really figured out a good solution for this one yet.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLZ/RYJ0/IWQUUQG5/FLZRYJ0IWQUUQG5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJF/T222/IWMR0VAK/FJFT222IWMR0VAK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 15: Connect Everything"}], "channel": "Table Top"}, {"category": "Play", "description": "Hey, this is an EASY way to do something awesome and impressive;)", "title": "How to Throw a Playing Card Like a Pro", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Throw-a-Playing-Card-Like-a-Pro/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Super simple.

This part definitely took me awhile, but as many of you already know looming can be very time consuming. If you don't know how to do a fish tail pattern I recommend you look it up as there are way better teachers then me on the subject but I will do my best to explain it here. Follow the pictures above as you read the steps. First string a band across your two pencils or mini loom kit and twist it so the band makes an X . Next simply loop 2 bands onto your mini loom or pencils. Now that you have three bands on, take the bottom band and bring the right end up and over the other two bands and into the middle. Do the same thing with the left side. Now add on another band and repeat the last two steps until you have a 25 band long string. Eventually you'll get down to the last bit and can't continue the pattern because if you put on another band you'll have 26.

To finish your string take the bottom of the two bands and loop them over the top one like you did earlier. now you should have only one band stretched out. Now its time for your S or C clips. Take one end of the stretched rubber band and put it into your clip. Take the band off the pencil and clip the other end of the rubber band so both ends are on one side of your C or S clip. Thats it!

It has a playing field and when a ball falls through the holes, the ball rolls down a return floor, out into a basket.\nI drew my basic plan on a piece of paper, eventually transferring my sketches onto a full size draft on cardboard. In my game, you pitch the ball with the plunger, then hit the ball with the single flipper. If the ball is \u201ccaught\u201d by a fielder, the player records an out. Otherwise, the ball falls in a hole and counts as a run. You play until you record 27 (or whatever amount you wish) outs, just like in real baseball.\nMake sure you account for the plunger in your design. The playing field will have the plunger attached to the left or right wall.\n2. Draw a finalized plan on a large piece of cardboard.

I also trimmed the tops of my sides down so the tops were always 2\u201d above the playing field.\n2. Hot glue the sides onto the playing field. I have a technique for creating strong, sturdy butt joints like you see throughout this project. First, make three large dabs on the thin edge of one board, then press and wait to cool. Once cooled, I lay a bead in the resultant corner. This is a very similar technique to welding metal plates together with MIG welder.\nClose Up of Hot Gluing a Weld in Cardboard\n3.

The original had pieces that were actually X and O shaped beads. This was not something I was willing to try for. The last time I made one of these, I used large wooden beads as the markers--but I could not find them this time. I did find some wooden blocks (from teaching volume in geometry class) and some dowel rods. It actually took longer to find the supplies than it did to make the game.\nThe game is simple enough for a 6 year old and challenging enough for teens and adults.

I originally created these back in October 2016 for components of my Halloween LEGO photo display. The design and electrical portion were ultimately created as a result of trial and error, and made to be as simple and minimalist as possible. If followed accordingly, each candle contains 29 LEGO pieces, one LED, one battery, and a few wires. This project requires some soldering, but substitutions can be made where applicable.\nLike the rest of my other LEGO projects, you're free to deviate from the design and use your own colors/pieces. In this model, the candle itself is white, with a dark grey candlestick, and a flickering LED. You can do such things as making the candles different colors, re-designing the candlestick, or even omitting the flickering function for a simple standard glowing LED. You could also use this basic tutorial as a mere suggestion for making a completely different candle concept, such as a small round votive candle made from LEGO bricks.", "title": "Illuminated Electronic LEGO LED Candles", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Illuminated-Electronic-LEGO-LED-Candles/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The candle only requires 29 common LEGO pieces, if using my design verbatim.

I think I bought mine from Party City for cheaper, since they were sold alongside illuminated Halloween costume components. Any 3V button cell can be substituted, so long as it's small enough to fit in the bottom of the candlestick holder.\nMicro toggle slide switch ($1.49 USD). I bought mine from the Tinkersphere store in New York City, but you can get this specific part from the previous URL. You can probably find similar ones from Radio Shack or eBay. The key is that it has to be a small toggle switch, and not a momentary switch.\nFlickering LED: I used 5mm LEDs at the for this model, since they're the only ones I had in my toolkit at the time of production, but 3mm LEDs would be a better fit. If using 5mm LEDs, the sides of the LED bulb must be clipped with scissors or sanded down, so that they can fit within the LEGO pieces. 3mm LEDs fit easily within the LEGO brick for the flame. Flickering LEDs are somewhat difficult to find in stores, so any regular white or yellow LED can suffice, if you want to forego the flickering effect for a standard glow.\n26-30 AWG wire, preferably two different colors to distinguish positive from ground connections. I always use red and black wires for building circuits.\nSoldering iron\nSolder\nElectrical tape\nNeedlenose pliers\nDue to the nature of the button cell, no resistors are needed, and they are wired directly to the switch and LED.\nUsing wire cutters, cut a ~9.5cm (7.67 inches) strip of black wire and strip both ends.\nCut two strips of red wire: ~16.5cm (6.49 inches) and ~3cm (1.18 inches), and strip both ends of both pieces.\nSolder the red wire to the anode (long leg) of the LED.\nSolder the longer black wire to the cathode (short leg) of the LED.\nTape a small strip of electrical tape around either the anode or cathode solder connection: this is done strictly to prevent the anode and cathode from making contact. If both wires connect while the candle is powered, it'll create a short circuit. Also adding a small strip of tape around the connection will help keep the wires inside the candle tube.\nPlace the transparent orange LEGO \"flame\" piece over top of the LED.\nSlide the two long wires down the inside of the white candle tube (consisting of 14 round white bricks).\nWith the red and black wires hanging out of the end of the white candle tube, attach the candle to the candlestick. The black wire should go all of the way through the grey candlestick holder and coming out from the end.\nThe red wire should poke through the small gap in the four 1x1 round bricks. The 4th brick -- a 1x1 cone -- is there since it creates a gap for the smaller red wire to poke through. You can disassemble parts of the candlestick base to allow the red wire to come through the tiny clearance, and then rebuild the base around the wires.\nSlide the smaller red wire through the bottom gap of the 1x1 round bricks, and allow it to come out through the bottom of the candlestick. As with the step above, you can disassemble pieces of the base and rebuild the base around the wires.\nThe black wire and the small red wire should be flush without about half an inch of slack coming out of the bottom of the candlestick holder.\nIf using the same slide switch as I purchased, clip off one of the left or right pins, so that only two pins come from the switch. Solder one pin to the 1st red wire and the other pin to the 2nd red wire.\nCarefully tape the button cell to the wires at the bottom, making sure to have proper polarity. The top of the battery -- the smooth side with the text -- is the positive (+) connection, and the bottom side with the textured surface is the negative/ground (-) connection. I usually start by laying out a small strip of electrical tape, then I place the black wire stripped end to the tape flat. I placed the bottom of the battery over the top of stripped wire, then I placed the stripped red wire over top of the battery. Carefully I wrapped the tape around the battery and two wire connections. NOTE: I had trouble keeping the stripped wired ends taped to the battery, so I soldered two small metal pieces at the ends of the wires. The metal strips were clipped off male wire spade connectors.\nFlick the switch to test the connection. If the LED does not glow, it means you have a faulty connection, a dead battery, or most likely the battery wrapping wasn't done tightly. With the switch still on, squeeze down on the wrapped battery to see if any light comes from the top of the candle. If the LED glows brightly as you squeeze down on the wrapped battery, it means you need to wrap it tighter. Sometimes this tightness issue gets resolved when you cram the wrapped battery into the bottom chamber of the candlestick base.\nIf functioning properly, carefully attach the bottom to the candlestick holder.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6V/1SSK/IWH3GC9D/F6V1SSKIWH3GC9D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHJ/AF08/IWH3GC9E/FHJAF08IWH3GC9E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFM/WGX7/IWH3GGFO/FFMWGX7IWH3GGFO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8K/DSE6/IWH3GGEG/F8KDSE6IWH3GGEG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPZ/E6XH/IWH3GGOS/FPZE6XHIWH3GGOS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0F/PV00/IWH3GGM6/F0FPV00IWH3GGM6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUK/UKRN/IWH3GGJC/FUKUKRNIWH3GGJC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDJ/9K55/IWH3GGD7/FDJ9K55IWH3GGD7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSB/07RY/IWH3GGHJ/FSB07RYIWH3GGHJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPA/OB5A/IWH3GH6Q/FPAOB5AIWH3GH6Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB5/R0TO/IWH3GH7X/FB5R0TOIWH3GH7X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMP/X394/IWH3GHCQ/FMPX394IWH3GHCQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS4/4TOI/IWH3GGRN/FS44TOIIWH3GGRN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAU/0E73/IWH3GGSG/FAU0E73IWH3GGSG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSN/5KZN/IWH3GGSH/FSN5KZNIWH3GGSH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRD/KN0O/IWH3GH23/FRDKN0OIWH3GH23.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE8/C5QT/IWH3GGYJ/FE8C5QTIWH3GGYJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLO/H7SK/IWH3GGW1/FLOH7SKIWH3GGW1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY8/UHHQ/IWH3GGVD/FY8UHHQIWH3GGVD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWY/V56R/IWH3GGVC/FWYV56RIWH3GGVC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Assembling the Electronic Innards"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "With any luck, your candle should be glowing and flickering like a champ. As mentioned in the previous step, here are some troubleshooting methods to try if the light won't go on, or if the LED is too dim:\nBefore connecting all of the electronic parts together, test out the LED, switch, and battery individually on a breadboard or with a voltmeter to see if they're functioning.\nWhen taping the battery to the wires, make sure it's wrapped tightly, and that the red and black wires don't touch each other. The red wire should touch only the top (shiny part) of the battery, and the black wire should only touch the bottom (textured part) of the battery. If the electrical tape wrapping isn't tight enough, the connections will come loose. Sometimes if the connections are loose, this can be resolved by cramming the wrapped battery inside the bottom of the candlestick holder, which securely keeps the whole wrap in place.\nMake sure the proper polarity is used for the LED: red wire to anode (long pin) and black wire to cathode (shorter pin). The anode and cathode should never touch, as this creates a short circuit -- hence why I recommend wrapping a small piece of tape around either one of the LED's pins after soldering.\n-Baron von Brunk\nCredits: photography and video recording by Julius von Brunk", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJT/WKIA/IWH3H8LZ/FJTWKIAIWH3H8LZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMS/0ZSM/IWH3H4QT/FMS0ZSMIWH3H4QT.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F77/XEOD/IWH3GXEF/F77XEODIWH3GXEF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB3/SD42/IWH3GXEQ/FB3SD42IWH3GXEQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Fire Fire FIRE!!!"}], "channel": "LEGO"}]
