Here's a trick I developed to prevent milk paint from splattering out of the mixing cup. Take a coffee filter and fold it up into quarters. Use scissors to cut a small hole right at the pointy tip.\nUnfold the coffee filter and cut a straight line up to the hole you just cut in the middle. The hole is necessary so that when the frother is on, the filter won't catch and get caught around the spinning spindle of the milk frother (trust me, I know this from experience).\nAfter the water and milk paint are added to the container, drape the filter over the top of the cup then insert the frother through the hole in the middle. Overlap the filter at the seam and now you're ready to turn on the frother without fear of splashing!

Instead of the usual ratio - 1:1, dilute it with more water to make it more like a stain (about 3 parts water to 1 part milk paint powder).\nSince we're making small batches, I use the tablespoon to measure the water and milk paint. I add the water to the cup first and then the milk paint (although some people swear by doing it the other way around).\nPut on the coffee filter as described in the previous step. Rest the frother on the bottom of the container and apply pressure. Turn it on and lift it up ever so slightly to mix. Work the powder into the water in this pouncing manner for a maximum of 20-30 seconds so it doesn\u2019t over-froth (if it does, there's a fix for that too!).\nRemove the filter and let it sit for a few minutes (go do something else). This will allow the water to absorb into the powder. Give it another quick mix with the frother - or you can simply use a wooden craft stick (which you should also use to periodically mix the paint because the minerals will settle as you paint).\nIf you find that the paint got too frothy, you can let it sit for a while so the bubbles disperse or skim them off and discard them. But who has time to wait when you're excited to get started? I skim the bubbles off.\nClean the Milk Frother\nSubmerge the frother in a cup of water and turn it on to rinse.

Some of these birds live to be over 70 years old, outliving their owners and some require a lot of attention, and all of them need owners to parrot proof their homes, because birds can get sick from things you have in the home like candles, aerosols, and cigarettes, just to name a few.\nHere is an article that could save you a lot of time and money", "title": "Why Teach Your Exotic Bird How to Read", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Why-Teach-Your-Exotic-Bird-How-to-Read/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Birds are very intelligent!

Every once in a while you can catch a few words with no problem. Annette carries yes and no cards with her in case Smirnoff needs them to answer her questions.\nParrots are very social creatures and vocal in their natural environment. They do not like to be left alone and will screech in distress. Smirnoff would screech anytime Annette left the room if he could not see her. His screech was so loud all of our neighbors commented that they could hear him. They laughed about it at the time but had this gone on for very long, I am sure there would have been complaints. Annette lives in the country and neighbors are not close enough to hear him. Smirnoff is her only bird that stresses when she is gone.\nWhen Annette was outside in the yard she would put Smirnoff in Buster's kitty cave and that made him happy because he could see her. Sometimes she put him in time-out if there was no reason for his screeching, but she only does this for a couple of minutes because he usually said \"Smirnoff is a good bird\" and stopped screeching.\nAnnette mentioned that Smirnoff had bitten her on a few occasions and she figured out that his biting issue was usually a balance problem because he had a broken wing from a previous injury before she got him. He uses his beak to grab onto her and that is when he accidentally bites her. Birds use their beaks as a tool for climbing, cracking nuts, and for defense. One night she decided to go downstairs and because of the poor lighting, it was difficult for Smirnoff to see and he bit her when he grabbed onto her. That is when she asked him if he was afraid of the stairs and he touched the yes card with his beak.Most birds have limited night vision.\nBirds also use their beaks for nest building which is a natural habit. You can't get mad at a parrot because he uses his beak to destroy something in the house, when it's his nature to do this. We had a supply of cardboard boxes and would give one to him to chew up and that kept him occupied and happy. Natural wood blocks are good as long as they are not treated or painted, best to double check and make sure the type of wood you are using is safe for birds.\nWhen she first got Smirnoff he chewed on his feathers a lot. The reason he did this, was because he developed the habit because toys and chews were not previously available for him.to chew on. Birds need chews to help them maintain their beaks. At first he was not interested in the things Annette gave him to play with, but as she worked with him, he began to engage with her and play with the toys, solving the chewing problem. Smirnoff spends his time out of the cage, except at night. He is ( only left alone for short periods of time,( another thing to consider before adopting a bird). She usually takes him everywhere she goes even Home Depot~\nThey have finished the bird room so the birds are cage free now. The room is large enough for them to fly. They are working on a large outdoor area for them to spend time outside.\nI am leaning towards most of the problems people have with birds are because the birds are depressed, bored, or stressed because they have nothing to do. These creatures are very active in their natural habitat and when you add the ability to fly for 7000 miles non stop, reference below.

An example will be built, but you do not have to stick to it, as it is fairly big and requires a lot of work. We will discuss that soon. However, I will provide generic design solutions with shape generators made via Tinkercad so you can easily adapt the system to your own needs: With your size, your plant, your construction and your whatever else may be in your mind!\nHi there!\nDo you have plants in your room? Most people have, even students in their dorms. While those emersed air-breathing greenish organic things are growing everywhere you get, you very rarely get to see submersed plants, aquatic plants. Plants, which grow under and optionally also over water. Most people have them in an aquarium. But... what about using aquarium plants as houseplants? With a pot staying somewhere in your room? And the idea was born... .\nIDEA: Take aquatic plants, put them in a transparent pipelike structure so they grow and place them anywhere indoor to have them being a houseplant. Sounds cool!\nPROBLEM: What's about the \"pipelike\" structure? Yeah. That will take a lot of work. It has to look good, it has to met the needs of the plant and, the most important thing, it has to be watertight. Turns out requirement 1 and 3 are to hardest to accomplish. This instructable will present a solution for constructing an individual pipe-structure, flowerpot, aquarium or whatever you want to call it. Let's call it aquapipot, because it sounds cool and it makes the instructable more comprehensive.\nSo this instructable is not strictly bound to a specific thing but to a generic solution you can easily adapt to your own liking. I think that has major advantages, but it requires a little more pre-work to be done by yourself before you can get the parts and start building: Make your plan.\nLET'S GET STARTED with the requirements and a presentation of the example plan!", "title": "Aquapipot: Waterplanter, Aquatic Flowerpot, Aquarium, Pipe Structure - Difficult to Describe, Just Look.", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Aquapipot-Waterplanter-Aquatic-Flowerpot-Aquarium-/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "PLANT: Which one do you prefer?\nIf you want to build your own aquapipot, you have to think the same way like when buying a pot for a \"normal\" plant: You need to fit the pot to meet the plant's needs. So go to your favorite search engine and look out for a cool waterplant!\nMy choice fell on Valisneria Gigantea (see image above). The plant can reach heights up to 2m and it grows straight upwards. It does not branch out over ground, so my aquapipot will be a long pipe at least 2m tall. However, the plant offshoots, so I need a larger diameter of the pipe. I choosed a pipe with 200mm outer diameter and 3mm wall thickness. We want the plant to have enough space to grow, because, you may have already guessed it seing the picture in the beginning, maintenance is not that easy (but there are solutions) :).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHN/S73G/JIOUDPF3/FHNS73GJIOUDPF3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Choose the Plant for Your Aquapipot"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "MATERIAL: Go with acrylic :)\nThe plants needs light and water. To provide both, I will use acrylic pipes and fittings so that light shines through. However, you can also use glass pipes or something else transparent. You could even choose a non-transparent pipe if you install an artifical lightsource.\nAcrylic has a significant advantages: It is widely available in different sizes and shapes (hemispheres, plates, rings, pipes, ...), it can be glued easily and with high strength, it can be thermoformed and it is a thermoplast of which filament is available to 3D-print fittings, flanges, joints and gaskets.\nTip: If you want to build a low-budget solution PET bottles can be considered instead of acrylic pipes. Just look out for a bottle with smooth walls.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3A/SEEC/JIOU11CU/F3ASEECJIOU11CU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Choose Your Material: Best Way to Go With Acrylic"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "CONSTRUCTION: Whatever the plant needs but make it watertight!\nTo prove that the design works, I pretty much maxed out the size for my 15 sqm room. Of course you can build anything you want - bigger or smaller. But seeing this example you get the idea and you have proof of concept:\nWith a pipe 2m long and put up vertically there are some major problems you have to cope with. All in all the water itself is the problem.\nYou first want to keep it in the pipe, so you have to ensure your construction is watertight. This is more important the higher the water-level you have in your aquapot as pressure rises accordingly. E.g. in this example, you have a pressure of about 0.2 bar at the bottom due to approx. 2m water depth. You may avoid this taking a plant which grows more horizontally so you can choose and put up your pipe accordingly (maybe even horizontally).Aquatic moss would be an example.\nSecond, you may want to have some kind of water circulation with a pipe that big. It would be easy to just hang a waterpump in there, but it would not look that good and still, circulation won't be optimal. That is why I choosed to adapt a very common design for a waterpump to fit my construction: The so called air lift pump. The idea is simple: Get a pipe in parallel and let air bubbles rise through it, creating a water stream upwards. Connect it to the big pipe with the plant at the top and the bottom and voil\u00e0, let the water circulate! Also, this looks really good :D but it needs more work. You may avoid this using pipes not that long or you just by placing the air bubbler in the main pipe.\nThird, the construction itself will get quite heavy in the example. However, you can just take a smaller plant and a smaller design. Makes everything easier :)\nDESIGN: To make the design look good in the end, you have to apply your personal design taste. I want to give the pipes an industrial look with flanges and screws and so on. To be honest, there is not very much of a choice as pipes with flanges just look \"industrial\". However, you could apply color or ornaments, e.g. to get a steampunk-design.\nMAKE YOUR SKETCH! Above you see the example sketch. A very simple one indeed. But you not only see the principle of an air lift pump, you can also make out which parts you need.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUH/TIFN/JIOUDQ5E/FUHTIFNJIOUDQ5E.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Choose Your Design and Cconstruction"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The next step is getting the parts. According to your plan, this will lead to a BOM with some acrylic pipes, rings, plates and maybe even hemispheres like in the example. To connect them with each other, you need fittings and flanges you can use with the parts. These are the parts needed for the example (of course you do not need that much filament and also not that much screws):\nMaterial:\n2x 200mm hemispheres\n1x 200mm 2m pipe\n1x 50mm 2m pipe\n1x 1kg acrylic filament (PMMA from Material4Print)\n1x 250g flexible filament (White FlexiSMART from FFFworld, shore hardness 88A)\n3D Printing:\n2x 200mm glue flange\n2x 50mm glue flange\n1x 100mm glue flange\n2x 50mm glue sideflange\n1x 100mm glue sideflange\n2x 50mm flanged curved pipe\n4x 50mm flange seal\n1x 100mm flange seal\n2x 200mm flange seal\nMounting and fixiation:\n200x M4 flanged lens head screw + M4 flanged nuts (non-toothed!)\n3x 200mm clamp for wall mount\nPlant and stuff:\n1x pack of Valisneria Gigantea\napprox. 4kg fine sand\naquarium air pump (Schego WS2)\n8mm silicone tubing and bubbler\nDepending on your construction there may even be fittings readily available for your pipe-diameters. However, the more individual approach is to 3D print your own fittings, pipes, flanges and seals. The usual workflow is to go into your preferred CAD editor and start designing. However, not everyone can use a CAD editor. And also because after my studies I want to have my future flat full of aquapipots, I went for a generic solution which makes the design process of different flanges and pipe-parts much easier. In fact, everyone can profit from it: Parametrized 3D models!\nTo be honest, until now with this instructable I never made any parametrized models. At least not intentionally as somehow every part modeled with boolean operations is parametric. Because of the planters challenge I took a look at Tinkercad a few days ago. To be honest, I once had done a few months before and I had closed the window a minute later because I thought it was a fairly simple online software which does not fit my needs. However, I was put right a few days ago, realizing you can write shape generators with javascript! And that is what makes this instructable generic.\nNow I provide a few links where you see the flanges, pipes and fittings I have designed, like in the pictures. All of them are made with shape generators so they are customizable. Be patient when using the shape generator as I did not optimize the code, nor did I took a lot of care on the parameter naming. I hope it is self-explaining to some point, if not, just ask me. Here are the links to each part:\nGlue flanges and seals (just make it flat to work as seal and make the bores a little smaller, see printed seals next step)\nPipe with one or two bored flanges\nAngled pipe with flanges\n(Angled) Side Flange for glueing in a hole in the side of a pipe\nWith those parts, you should be able to substantiate your plan. I would suggest to make a 3D model if the project is a bigger one. This way you really make sure all the diameters, thicknesses, flange widths and bores match with their counterparts. With this in mind, I think it is good to tell you some errors I made during the design process:\nUse straight numbers for the bore count. If you don't, you cannot rotate the flange in 90\u00b0 steps.\nMake sure you have the right tolerances. You can see it when editing one of the glue flanges: The inner one is designed to be glued to a pipe with 50mm outer diameter and 3mm wall thickness. Notice the thickness of pipe in the sketch is 3.2mm to make it fit perfectly after 3D printing. The collar's main intend is to provide guidance when glueing and to mask up errors on the cut of the pipe. It has nearly no structural use unless you inforce it with triangles. So better take a tolerance too big than too short here.\nDouble check wheather each part fits to its counterpart\nYou may want to refine the parts using Blender or another software. It allows not only to refine meshes but also to add sweeps via the subdivision surface modifier by selecting the appropriate edge.

Also check local dealers, especially when you want to build something really big. As acrylic is a widely used material, there are online shops only selling acrylic parts like pipes, hemispheres, plates and much more in different shapes and sizes. My experience was them having more favourable and versatile offers than Ebay or Amazon.\nThe seals can be 3D printed with flexible filament by scaling down the glue flanges in Z. You can also make a silicon mold or you can buy seals.\nAnother important thing to aquire are the nuts and screws. Choose screws and nuts with (flat!) flanges or use washers instead. You also may want to get stainless parts. They look better and they are water resistant. When you are using saline water, e.g. to grow mangroves or for a marine aquarium, you better use a high-grade stainless steel which can withstand saline water.

The filament can be named differently, e.g. acrylic filament, PMMA filament or even Plexiglas filament. Unfortunately it is not as common as PLA, ABS or PETG. However, it should be no problem getting acrylic filament, maybe even coloured if you want to give the aquapipe some colour features.\nI used PMMA filament from Material4Print (M4P). I used the standard PETG settings which came with the Prusa i3 MK3 but I bumped up the hotend temperature to 260\u00b0C and the heatbed temperature to 100\u00b0C. Prints came out really nice. Possible failures or annoying things you may stumble into:\nMake sure your first layer calibration is good. Too low or to high and it will not stick - yes, also when it is too low as the neighboured layers are lifted up.\nTo improve bed adhesion use a glue stick and use a brim.\nHave an hermetically sealed enclosure or print in a well ventilated area. Acrylic smells pretty bad, even more intense than ABS. I have the misfortune to live in a dorm room so... .Just avoid the printer during printing PMMA. Go outside, have a walk, drink some tea or better make an hourlasting teaparty, you know what I mean. And leave the window open.\nDry the filament. PMMA or acrylic absorbes up to 1.x% water. If your filament makes brizzling noises during printing, dry it. Stop the print. You do not want air bubbles in your part and you do not want it to become less strong. Above there are some microscopic pictures showing a piece of extruded filament with and without air bubbles - the first was wet, the latter dry.\nPrint the parts with a lot of perimeters and 100% infill. You want the parts to be strong. Especially bores are stronger with more perimeters. I used a bit more than 10 perimeters in the example prints, with a 0.4mm nozzle.\nIf you have a bigger nozzle, use it.\nPay attention on warping. Acrylic warps quite alot although it is not like nylon or similar difficult to print filaments. It is even better than with ABS. Just use supports (strong ones!) and, if there are overhangs more than about 30 degrees, the trick is to print very slow.\nPrint the angled pipes like shown in the picture above, with a massive support.

When you have a drill press use it as it not only improves precision but also makes it easier to ensure a slow feed motion so no cracks will occur. A milling machine would be even better if you have one. However, a power drill should also work. Just drill slow and with less pressure/slow feed(!).\nAlso drill the bores for the flange which are not 3D printed. In the example these are the two hemisphere flanges.

Acrylic is highly allergic to that.\nSo better increase saw speed and dedcrease feed motion. Also make sure to use the right saw blades, e.g. blades suitable for PVC. Blades for metal will be ok too.

Stay away from the usual adhesives you use for paper and wood. Also, do not rely on resin or other fancy adhesives. Use adhesive for acrylic :)\nGlueing the parts is more difficult than it seems. I would even say it is the most difficult step in this instructable: Too much glue and the bond seam looks bad, too little glue and it may be leaky and has decreased stability. In fact, better use to much glue than too little.\nThe collars on the flanges make glueing much easier as they hide the bond seam. But still it is a difficult job you may want to learn via practice on several examples before. If you need to wipe away glue leavings, DO NOT do it with your fingers nor do it with a towel or anything else which has no smooth surface! Use wrapping film or a scraper instead. This way, even when glue mets a visible surface, it will stay transparent and glossy so you will hardly notice it on the finished aquapipot.\nHowever, I would only wipe away glue deposits in case of an emergency, e.g. when a glue drop begins to flow over visible surfaces. Here are some pictures of the glued example aquapipot.\nThe latter two pictures are quite important: They show the alignment of the two glue flanges to the angled pipes of the air lift pump.

As said, I live in a dorm room and yes, there are possiblities. You don't need a few thousand dollar tempering oven. All you need is a wardrobe large enough to fit your parts in (I used an IKEA PAX) and a modified fan heater which allows reaching temperatures up to 80 \u00b0C. You also may want a PID to regulate the fan heater, but you can also do it manually.\nFirst clear your wardrobe so that it is empty providing enough space for your parts. Place your parts in it. The best way is to hang them up on a wire or so. It was very tight fit for the big pipe but it works, see the pictures.\nI used a PID first but then switched to manual control as the modified fan heater was switched on and off absolutely, which means the air convection stopped and the temperature difference between up and down inside the PAX became unacceptable.

This is my first \"Instructables\" and also the submission for the planters challenge.\nIn order to come up with the planter design, I tried to incorporate few very trending things in the DIY communities:\n1. 3D printer\n2. LEDs\n3. Magnets\n4. Craft\nAfter spending considerable amount of time brainstorming, I decided to this self-watering planter that can work as a desktop planter with LEDs illuminating it and also as a fridge magnet if you are too tired of the usual souvenir magnets that your friend/family/neighbor gave you of places you have probably never been to. And who wouldn't want to a put a nice planter on a fridge, right?\nAlongside, I also wanted to make it wirefree (when used as a desktop planter) with a fancy switching mechanism. Instead of turning an ON/OFF switch (who wants switches anyways!), I came up with a simple mechanism where if you connect the light and electronic case to the planter, the LEDs automatically turns on and if you detach it, the LEDs turn off. Now that's convenient!\nAnd let's all be honest: keeping plants are fun but watering is an added chore that anybody would want to put aside. For that reason, I also incorporated the self watering mechanism to keep the soil moist and hydrated for few days.\nNow, all these seem like the project will need loads of things and a long time to make. However, that is not the case. I have tried to keep this project as simple as possible to make and with things that you have lying around in your house (assuming you are a DIYer and have a 3D printer). If not, a single order from amazon or couple of trips to dollarstore and an electronic store will suffice.\nWith all these said, let's look at all the materials that are needed:\n1. 3D printer + filament spools (depend on your colour preference).\n2. 3D printed parts (planter, water reservoir plate, LED and electronics holder and cover).\n3. Epoxy\n4. Oil colours\n5. Hot glue gun\n6. Jute rope\n7. Superglue\n8. Wire (you can use the wires from CAT5 cable)\n9. Battery (9V battery)\n10. LED strip\n11. Magnets (x8 ceramic magnets 0.709\" x 0.197\" disc + x4 neodymium magnet 1/8\" x 1/16\" disc)\n12. Soldering iron\n13. Multimeter\n14.

Seeing as I want the planter to be modular I wanted each individual unit to be quite small and easy to print. The design considerations I debated over are as follows:\nThe basic shape came from a honeycomb pattern, as each individual hexagon can fit in with as many others as you like. Thus you can start the set one plant at a time and there is no need to have loads of them from the get go.\nI wanted the planters to be both usable on their own or as groups; either on a bench, table or suspended. Thus I put holes in the design such that they can be tied together as groups, suspended one under another or suspended as a group. These holes needed to be outside the edges of the pot so that it doesn't leak.\nThe planters need to be waterproof so that they don't leak onto the windowsill/table when you put them down or drip onto the floor when you hang them. This is relatively easy to do if your print settings are right but means you need to be careful not to over water your plants.\nSeedlings can dry out quickly if you forget to water them for a day or two and if you water too vigorously you can wash away the seeds before they sprout. So I designed a simple hydroponics system where you put water into a separate container, it travels along a string and waters from the base up into the soil.\nThe planters need to be easy to print and not require any support material such that it doesn't require much post print clean-up or waste any plastic. To do this when I designed the planter I made sure there weren't any big overhangs and the holes were more triangular than round so that there aren't bridging points that need supports.\nTo simplify the design I made it so you tie the planters together rather than have a rigid connection so the designs look simple and allow for a degree of error with the actual prints.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 3: Design Considerations"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "I built the model using Tinkercad. I have used Tinkercad for a while now as it was the simplest free software I found and lets me build simple models quite quickly. I am not an expert with the software but I can give you some of the tips and tricks I have picked up while using it.\nOne of the main things to keep in mind is that Tinkercad is a shape editor, so you build up your model from a series of simple shapes merged together. This can be challenging with very complex shapes unless you can imagine a creative way to put them together. For my model I wanted it to be based off a hexagon but the best way I could imaging putting it together was to build up an individual wall and then duplicate it to make the complete model.\nI played around for a while to get my first version of my model, which took quite a while as I was still trying to rough out the size of everything and how to put it together. I then modified it to get the second version which I was happy with and then I rebuilt it again from scratch to get the final version. This final version was the one I documented as it was the way I put the model together minus all the tweaks and changes made during the first couple of drafts.\nEnough rambling, onto the actual steps I followed. I will go over everything in the same order as my screenshots, not focusing on the dimension but rather the process (when I use a Tinkercad function I will underline it):\nStarting with a basic hexagon (the built in polygon function set to 6 sides), I scaled it up to the desired size\nI added a wedge and stretched it to match the hexagons width before setting the height. I used a wedge as I wanted the sides to be tapered outwards. I then hid (Ctrl +H) the hexagon so it wouldn't get in the way.\nI set the wedge to be a hole on its properties tab and moved the workplane to the slanted side of the wedge. Onto this side of the wedge I added a rectangle that will become the wall of my planter. I set the corner of my rectangle to match my wedge and set it to have a thin height and a width the same as the height of my wedge. This is quite simple to do either by stretching the corner of the shape or using the ruler tool, selecting the wedge to see its dimensions then selecting the block and typing in the same dimensions.\nI then returned the workplane to its default floor before adding in another wedge to reinforce the top corners of my hexagon. I rotated the shape to face upwards and set it to the same height as the wedge. I stretched the sides until they looked right and matched its corner to that of the wedge. Rather than making another one from scratch I just Ctrl + C (copy) and Ctrl +V (paste) another one which I placed on the other side. Seeing as the wedge is set to a hole when I group the shapes the bottom of it will be removed.\nAs the base for one of the walls is done it is time to duplicate them to make the hexagon. Simply select all the objects and press Ctrl + D (duplicate), this makes another set of objects in the exact same place and auto selects them (be careful not to make several duplicates by mistake). The duplicate I rotated by 180 degrees and moved it away to form the opposite sides wall. Now we have two walls.\nRather than making the other walls and struggling to get them to the right spot all you need to do is select both opposite walls and duplicate them again. This time once they are duplicated rotate them by 60 degrees. If you press Ctrl + D to duplicate them again Tinkercad will automatically make the duplicate and rotate it by another 60 degrees to make the remaining walls (it repeats the action you did with the last duplicate). You now have all the sides done.\nNow to put a floor onto the shape I unhid/showed all shapes by pressing Ctrl + Shift + H, I set the ruler to use the mid-point measurement (click on the circle of the ruler to switch between edge or mid-point) and selecting all the walls I could see the mid point then when I selected the hexagon I set it to match the walls.\nWe now have a planter that could be grouped with others, but I still wanted to add holes to hang it from and a spout to water it with.\nFirst I added some tall skinny cylinders to two opposite corners then just like sides I duplicated and rotated them to get all the corners. I left them tall so I could see that they lined up but these are actually the holes for the base hexagon. I turned them into holes and hid (Ctrl + H) them before grouping (Ctrl + G) all the wall shapes together. Now when the are unhid (Ctrl +Shift +H) they can be seen with the walls and floor.\nTime to add a spout. I placed the workplane onto one of the walls and placed a pyramid onto it. This pyramid I then cut in half by grouping it with a hole rectangle and stretched to the desired shape.\nTo make the spout hollow I duplicated the shape, made it into a hole and made it slightly smaller. When I grouped the hollow shape and spout I now had the spout walls done but no hole in the wall for it.\nI hid (Ctrl +H) the spout walls and placed a triangle hole at the desired height. I used a triangular hole as this does not need any form of support when 3D printed. I checked the hole relative to the spout before grouping (Ctrl +G) the walls and hole. The spout is now complete.\nAll that is left is to add the top holes. I shrunk the base holes down so they were out of the way. I then moved the workplane to an inside edge and added a pentagon hole to the surface. I made sure the holes centre matched the shapes centre, I then duplicated and rotated it so that holes went through all sides.\nYou now just need to group everything together and you have a Modular Seedling Planter.\nMy steps are easiest to follow if you follow along in the pictures.

This plastic is quite hard to get your printer settings right, but produces great prints which are strong, durable, and flexible. PETG also has the great property of being food safe and the one I'm using is UV stable so it should be fine in the sun. As PETG has a high melting point you get a strong bond between layers.\nYou also need to think about your print settings such that the walls and base are solid, so that the planter doesn't leak. Also if your retraction settings are right you won't need any clean up afterwards as the models are designed to be printed without any support material.\nAll you do now is take your model and import it into your desired slicer program and slice the model. I use Repetier-Host and Slic3r.\nThese models are quite small so they don't use much plastic but as they have a large amount of surface area and I print surfaces quite slowly each container took about 3 hrs to print. I made a time-lapse of a print so you can watch one of the planters grow. This is my first time making one of these time lapses but they do look quite cool as they turn 3 hours into 50 seconds.\nIf you plan on having a full set of planters I would recommend also printing the water container. This allows you to use a basic hydroponics system to water your seeds and keep them happy.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FH0/8GVI/JIAJOQMP/FH08GVIJIAJOQMP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLK/0Y0A/JIAJOQO1/FLK0Y0AJIAJOQO1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEA/W0DG/JIAJOQN6/FEAW0DGJIAJOQN6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWU/QZIW/JIKK0Z81/FWUQZIWJIKK0Z81.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Printing the Model"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Time for some gardening.\nThe first thing to do is check that your planter is watertight. If your planter leaks you need to be careful what surface you leave it on or where you hang it. A simple fix for leaky planter is to give it a coat of clear spray paint or take a little glue and full the hole up.\nNow if you are going to be using the watering system you need to take a piece of cotton string and push it down through the spout. The string needs to be long enough that it can go from the base of your planter to the top and down to the bottom again, I make the string slightly too long as you can always cut it shorter later. This string will be the tongue that drinks from the water container.\nNext, I put a little square of newspaper in to act as a sleeve for the planter. The idea being that this makes it is easier to take the plants out when they are no longer seedlings. You don't have to put the newspaper in as the planters are tapered the plant should come out relatively easily.\nTake some soil and full your planter 3/4 full. I used the compressed soil that needed to be re-hydrated first. Sprinkle some seeds onto the soil and cover with more soil until the planter is almost full.\nGive the planter a quick watering and your seed is well on its way to growing up big and strong.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F70/W7FV/JIKK10F9/F70W7FVJIKK10F9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0X/2ZK4/JIKK10G5/F0X2ZK4JIKK10G5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNP/LOQV/JIKK10H4/FNPLOQVJIKK10H4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FST/0BTB/JIOU2OHS/FST0BTBJIOU2OHS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX1/SD59/JIOU2OK4/FX1SD59JIOU2OK4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8D/WKO7/JIKK10HZ/F8DWKO7JIKK10HZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9C/X7IO/JIKK10JO/F9CX7IOJIKK10JO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRA/IS9O/JIKK10KM/FRAIS9OJIKK10KM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F54/YJXV/JIKK10N9/F54YJXVJIKK10N9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5Q/SBAX/JIKK10P2/F5QSBAXJIKK10P2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0Q/68O3/JIKK10Q0/F0Q68O3JIKK10Q0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAT/7SE5/JIKK10UK/FAT7SE5JIKK10UK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Planting You Seeds"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "The planters are designed to be modular parts of groups of six.

See the photos as it is kinda hard to explain. A small wire hook makes the threading a whole lot easier.\nOnce all the planters are threaded pull the string tight carefully and tie the two ends together. If you don't want to hang your planters all you need to do is add to the water pot and your are done.\nTo hang the planters what you do is thread a loop from the base holes of two adjacent planters through the two holes at the top and tie it off. Make sure to leave a long length of extra string as it will be used to suspend the planter. Repeat this threading step for each spot between the planter so that you will have all the planters tied to each other and six long strings.\nAs the planters are tied together you should notice that they will be held quite rigidly in place. Take the six long strings and hold them above the planters centre. Decide how tall the hanging point needs to be and tie all the loops together at that height.

When you have small seedlings it is easy to forget to water them for a day and to come home and see them roasted by the sun. Also when watering right on top of tiny seeds you run the risk of washing them away. Hence make a gentle self watering system.\nThe watering system is made up of a small water container that fits in the middle of the ring of planters. The cotton strings that were placed into the planters go into this container and when they get wet the water flows along them and into the base of the planter. All you need to do is full the container once every day or two, depending on the weather.\nTo get the system working; start by printing the water spout file and making sure that it too doesn't leak. Next take the group of planters and carefully move the cotton tongues out the way. Slot the water container into place and put each string into the slot of the water container.
