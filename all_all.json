Some people add milk or cream, some people say don't add milk or cream. I have made omelets with water, with milk, without any added liquid, etc. It is up to you. I recommend trying all those options. But whatever you do don't add too much a couple teaspoons to a tablespoon for a few eggs is the most you probably want to add. The idea is the added liquid makes the eggs more fluffy. Also there is a bit of debate about the salt, and when you should add it. If you add the salt and then walk away from your eggs and come back 15 to 30 minutes later the eggs will change color and become almost light orangish.

If they are too thick they will have a hard time bending, but don't worry about it too much. really thin ones are good for creating the center rose. Another method is to use a mandolin slicer. If you don't core the apples first after wards you can dig out the core with a melon baller, but that takes more time do it that way.

In early days people were a bit easy with children and alcohol and often made an exception for holidays so we always got a piece of sneeuwster at Easter, a treat we loved. At home advocaat was always made by my mum at Easter and my dad baked the sneeuwster. My dad always baked apple pie, butter cake, oliebollen, cake. You name it, he made it. My mum preferred to cook and prepare, 7 days a week, a three course menu and always with a lot of vegetables from our garden. We as children had to learn to cook and bake at a young age and we still like to do that.\n\nFor this Easter, I looked up my mums advocaat recipe and my dads sneeuwstar recipe because without advocaat no sneeuwster.\n\nActually you make advocaat with a special Dutch brandy, but that is, just like advocaat, outside the Netherlands not or barely not for sale. Replaced by another brandy, it can be less tasty for not every brandy is suitable so I have replaced the brandy with vodka. Vodka is generally available and a good alternative.\n\nWhat is advocaat? Advocaat is difficult to translate because the English translation for advocaat is lawyer so I wanted to know where the name came from to translate it right. There are several explanations, but I found the most funny explanation on Wikipedia where you can read:\n\n\u201cAdvocaat is the Dutch word for \"lawyer\". As the name of the drink, it is short for advocatenborrel, or \"lawyer's drink\", where borrel is Dutch for a small alcoholic beverage consumed slowly during a social gathering. According to the 1882 edition of the Woordenboek der Nederlandsche taal (Dictionary of the Dutch Language), it is \"zoo genoemd als een goed smeersel voor de keel, en dus bijzonder dienstig geacht voor een advocaat, die in 't openbaar het woord moet voeren\" (\"so named as a good lubricant for the throat, and thus considered especially useful for a lawyer, who must speak in public\u201d). So I just decide to keep the Dutch name: Advocaat. I couldn\u2019t use eggnog as translation for advocaat is certainly not eggnog.", "title": "Sneeuwster and Advocaat a Dutch Treat for Easter", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Sneeuwster-and-Advocaat-a-Dutch-Treat-for-Easter/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "What do you need:\n\nFor the advocaat:\n12 egg yolks at room temperature\n25 gr.

However, do not cut to the edge but stop about 3 cm before you reach the edge.\n\nBeat the cream with icing sugar until stiff, if necessary use a stabilizer to get a firm whipped cream.\n\nNow cover the lower part of the cake with a thick layer of advocaat and then scoop the cream onto the advocaat. Make sure the whipped cream in the middle makes a dome. Place the top part of the cake on the whipped cream and lightly press the outer edge. Because the whipped cream in the middle makes a dome, the incised points will open and form a star.

Other than Peanut Chikki it also comes in different varieties such as dry fruit Chikki, coconut Chikki etc.\nI think it's worth mentioning how Chikki came into existence.\nHistory of Peanut Chikki\nBack in the early 1900s, when railway lines were established in India, railway tracks were constructed to connect Mumbai and Pune. There comes a stop between them, this small town. Lonavla(famous hill station).\nDuring that time major parts of India were affected by famine including Mumbai. The construction work was huge and poor laborers needed energetic food to work efficiently. Chikki was invented by a local sweet seller of Lonavla named Mr. Maganlal. Chikki as being a healthy source of nutrients and affordable to every economy made it popular among workers. And later among travelers as Railway asked him(and his sons) to sell Chikki to travelers. The business is still well going after 5 generations in Lonavla. It\u2019s been 120 years since then and now Chikki is popular as winter snack all over India and its other neighbor countries(Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka).\nCredit for its massive popularity is also because of its easy preparation.\nPreparation Time: 30 mins approx.", "title": "Chikki Aka PEANUT JAGGERY BAR", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Chikki-Aka-PEANUT-JAGGERY-BAR/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Ingredients\n1-2 cup of Peanuts (100-150 grams)\n1 cup of Jaggery\nWater\nGhee (Clarified Butter)\nSupplies\nPan\nStirrer Stick\nPlate\nBowl\nKitchen towel\nKnife\nMarble board (optional)\nAll set.

The idea here is just to not have the chocolate directly on the heat source but there are lots of ways to do this.\n\nSo onto the chocolate melting.\n\nStart with good, dark chocolate. Break it up into small pieces and place it in an empty bowl over the boiling water. The chocolate will melt and you can toss in your dried orange slices. I find I can do between 6-10 in a 'batch' before it becomes too cluttered to work in the bowl.\n\nIf I'm honest, this is always the part of the process that feels like it can go on forever. I now feel like it's a form of meditation but give yourself ~30 minutes to work through 2 oranges worth of orange peel.\n\nAfter experimenting with many kitchen utensils, I've landed on my favorite method which is two forks used in tandem. I fish out a single piece with one fork and volley it back and forth to let the excess chocolate drip back into the bowl before placing it onto the parchment paper.\n\nNote from other Instructablers: a great comment was made below about not overheating the chocolate at this stage as well as tempering the chocolate. Both are great refinements to this stage - thanks for making this Instructable even better:\n\"You might want to add warnings about not overheating the chocolate (ALWAYS under 120 deg F). My niece tried a chocolate candy (I wasn't around) andlet it get too hot: the result was grainy and ... not nice.

There are several ways to temper chocolate, but I would say the two easiest for home crafting is either using the double boiler/seeding method or the microwave method. I will be using the double boiler and seeding method (cause I like to pretend I'm fancy) but I will put a link to the microwave method for you here and it is just as easy. To get started with the method I'm using I'll need:\nThe glass bowl mentioned before\nA pot slightly smaller than the bowl so no steam will escape\nGood quality chocolate mentioned before\nGrab the pot and put about an inch or two of water into the bottom and bring to a simmer, while that is happening break up all the chocolate into smaller pieces if you happened to buy bars like I did, if you already have chips or wafers just leave them as is. Now place 1/3 of the total amount of chocolate to the side and that will be your \"seeding\" chocolate, the other 2/3 you can place into the glass bowl. Once the water is simmering then turn off the heat and place the glass bowl filled with chocolate on top of the pot and begin stirring. Not too much will happen at first and this is a slower process but good chocolate deserves the best treatment (like good food cooked low and slow). We are going to keep stirring until our chocolate melts completely and reaches 110-115 degrees Fahrenheit but NEVER over 120 degrees Fahrenheit according to the thermometer you are using.\nNext we will take the glass bowl off the pot and bring it over to the counter onto a clean dish towel (this just helps the bowl stay put while stirring as well as keeping the counter from getting wet). Keep stirring until the thermometer reads 96 or 97 degrees, then take the 1/3 reserved chocolate from before and add it to your melted chocolate then keep stirring until that melts and everything reaches a temperature of 85-86 degrees Fahrenheit.

Bring to a simmer for approximately 30-40 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes, check with a wooden spoon the consistency of the syrup by dipping the spoon into the solution and letting a couple drops fall onto a plate. If the syrup spreads for a second but holds its shape, it is ready. If it spreads out but does not hold its shape, it needs to be cooked longer. If the syrup solidifies and does not spread at all, it is overcooked. This could happen if the heat is too high and the water evaporated too quickly.

Every time you are not getting Phyllo sheets, you need to recover it with the towel or it will dry out and get crumbly.\n- Phyllo dough always goes down 2 sheets at a time. Those 2 sheets are always brushed on top with melted butter\n- When brushing with butter, have a light hand. It's fine if every inch isn't coated. You can use an extra tablespoon or 2 of butter if you run out - but too much more is going to make your baklava soggy. (but probably still delicious)\nTo assemble your baklava:\nBegin by brushing the bottom and sides of your dish with melted butter.\nPut 2 sheets of phyllo dough in your dish. Lightly brush these sheets with your melted butter.\nRepeat this 4 times, until you have 8 sheets of phyllo dough in your baking dish.\nNext, sprinkle some of your walnuts over the top.\nFollow this by 2 more sheets of phyllo dough, and brush the top with butter.\nNow, sprinkle with chocolate chips and bits of cherries.\n2 more phyllo sheets, butter, then walnuts.\n2 more phyllo sheets, butter, then chocolate and cherries.\nRepeat over and over!\nTo finish the top, repeat the 8 layers of dough, with butter between each two (like we did for the bottom)\nI like to set aside 8 sheets of phyllo dough for my top layers, so I don't have to keep counting while I'm assembling the baklava.\nHelpful hints:\n- Don't panic if your phyllo bunches up or tears. It's totally fine! You won't be able to tell in the end, it's nothing to stress about.\n- If your sides get too tall toward the end, you can just push them down into the baking dish when you're finished.\n- You don't have to have all the nuts, chocolate, or cherries on your layers perfect or even. Because there's going to be so many layers, you'll end up with enough ingredients in each bite. If you run out of one of the filling ingredients, that's fine too! You'll just have more of that ingredient in your bottom layers!\n- I had about 1/2 c. of chocolate chips left. I just melted them and drizzled them over the top.

Take your time and be careful - the top sheets of phyllo are going to want to stick to your fingers and the knife.\nThis is important for a couple of reasons. First, phyllo dough is crisp and stubborn once it's baked.
