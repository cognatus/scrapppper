Here's a trick I developed to prevent milk paint from splattering out of the mixing cup. Take a coffee filter and fold it up into quarters. Use scissors to cut a small hole right at the pointy tip.\nUnfold the coffee filter and cut a straight line up to the hole you just cut in the middle. The hole is necessary so that when the frother is on, the filter won't catch and get caught around the spinning spindle of the milk frother (trust me, I know this from experience).\nAfter the water and milk paint are added to the container, drape the filter over the top of the cup then insert the frother through the hole in the middle. Overlap the filter at the seam and now you're ready to turn on the frother without fear of splashing!

Instead of the usual ratio - 1:1, dilute it with more water to make it more like a stain (about 3 parts water to 1 part milk paint powder).\nSince we're making small batches, I use the tablespoon to measure the water and milk paint. I add the water to the cup first and then the milk paint (although some people swear by doing it the other way around).\nPut on the coffee filter as described in the previous step. Rest the frother on the bottom of the container and apply pressure. Turn it on and lift it up ever so slightly to mix. Work the powder into the water in this pouncing manner for a maximum of 20-30 seconds so it doesn\u2019t over-froth (if it does, there's a fix for that too!).\nRemove the filter and let it sit for a few minutes (go do something else). This will allow the water to absorb into the powder. Give it another quick mix with the frother - or you can simply use a wooden craft stick (which you should also use to periodically mix the paint because the minerals will settle as you paint).\nIf you find that the paint got too frothy, you can let it sit for a while so the bubbles disperse or skim them off and discard them. But who has time to wait when you're excited to get started? I skim the bubbles off.\nClean the Milk Frother\nSubmerge the frother in a cup of water and turn it on to rinse.

Some of these birds live to be over 70 years old, outliving their owners and some require a lot of attention, and all of them need owners to parrot proof their homes, because birds can get sick from things you have in the home like candles, aerosols, and cigarettes, just to name a few.\nHere is an article that could save you a lot of time and money", "title": "Why Teach Your Exotic Bird How to Read", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Why-Teach-Your-Exotic-Bird-How-to-Read/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Birds are very intelligent!

Every once in a while you can catch a few words with no problem. Annette carries yes and no cards with her in case Smirnoff needs them to answer her questions.\nParrots are very social creatures and vocal in their natural environment. They do not like to be left alone and will screech in distress. Smirnoff would screech anytime Annette left the room if he could not see her. His screech was so loud all of our neighbors commented that they could hear him. They laughed about it at the time but had this gone on for very long, I am sure there would have been complaints. Annette lives in the country and neighbors are not close enough to hear him. Smirnoff is her only bird that stresses when she is gone.\nWhen Annette was outside in the yard she would put Smirnoff in Buster's kitty cave and that made him happy because he could see her. Sometimes she put him in time-out if there was no reason for his screeching, but she only does this for a couple of minutes because he usually said \"Smirnoff is a good bird\" and stopped screeching.\nAnnette mentioned that Smirnoff had bitten her on a few occasions and she figured out that his biting issue was usually a balance problem because he had a broken wing from a previous injury before she got him. He uses his beak to grab onto her and that is when he accidentally bites her. Birds use their beaks as a tool for climbing, cracking nuts, and for defense. One night she decided to go downstairs and because of the poor lighting, it was difficult for Smirnoff to see and he bit her when he grabbed onto her. That is when she asked him if he was afraid of the stairs and he touched the yes card with his beak.Most birds have limited night vision.\nBirds also use their beaks for nest building which is a natural habit. You can't get mad at a parrot because he uses his beak to destroy something in the house, when it's his nature to do this. We had a supply of cardboard boxes and would give one to him to chew up and that kept him occupied and happy. Natural wood blocks are good as long as they are not treated or painted, best to double check and make sure the type of wood you are using is safe for birds.\nWhen she first got Smirnoff he chewed on his feathers a lot. The reason he did this, was because he developed the habit because toys and chews were not previously available for him.to chew on. Birds need chews to help them maintain their beaks. At first he was not interested in the things Annette gave him to play with, but as she worked with him, he began to engage with her and play with the toys, solving the chewing problem. Smirnoff spends his time out of the cage, except at night. He is ( only left alone for short periods of time,( another thing to consider before adopting a bird). She usually takes him everywhere she goes even Home Depot~\nThey have finished the bird room so the birds are cage free now. The room is large enough for them to fly. They are working on a large outdoor area for them to spend time outside.\nI am leaning towards most of the problems people have with birds are because the birds are depressed, bored, or stressed because they have nothing to do. These creatures are very active in their natural habitat and when you add the ability to fly for 7000 miles non stop, reference below.

An example will be built, but you do not have to stick to it, as it is fairly big and requires a lot of work. We will discuss that soon. However, I will provide generic design solutions with shape generators made via Tinkercad so you can easily adapt the system to your own needs: With your size, your plant, your construction and your whatever else may be in your mind!\nHi there!\nDo you have plants in your room? Most people have, even students in their dorms. While those emersed air-breathing greenish organic things are growing everywhere you get, you very rarely get to see submersed plants, aquatic plants. Plants, which grow under and optionally also over water. Most people have them in an aquarium. But... what about using aquarium plants as houseplants? With a pot staying somewhere in your room? And the idea was born... .\nIDEA: Take aquatic plants, put them in a transparent pipelike structure so they grow and place them anywhere indoor to have them being a houseplant. Sounds cool!\nPROBLEM: What's about the \"pipelike\" structure? Yeah. That will take a lot of work. It has to look good, it has to met the needs of the plant and, the most important thing, it has to be watertight. Turns out requirement 1 and 3 are to hardest to accomplish. This instructable will present a solution for constructing an individual pipe-structure, flowerpot, aquarium or whatever you want to call it. Let's call it aquapipot, because it sounds cool and it makes the instructable more comprehensive.\nSo this instructable is not strictly bound to a specific thing but to a generic solution you can easily adapt to your own liking. I think that has major advantages, but it requires a little more pre-work to be done by yourself before you can get the parts and start building: Make your plan.\nLET'S GET STARTED with the requirements and a presentation of the example plan!", "title": "Aquapipot: Waterplanter, Aquatic Flowerpot, Aquarium, Pipe Structure - Difficult to Describe, Just Look.", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Aquapipot-Waterplanter-Aquatic-Flowerpot-Aquarium-/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "PLANT: Which one do you prefer?\nIf you want to build your own aquapipot, you have to think the same way like when buying a pot for a \"normal\" plant: You need to fit the pot to meet the plant's needs. So go to your favorite search engine and look out for a cool waterplant!\nMy choice fell on Valisneria Gigantea (see image above). The plant can reach heights up to 2m and it grows straight upwards. It does not branch out over ground, so my aquapipot will be a long pipe at least 2m tall. However, the plant offshoots, so I need a larger diameter of the pipe. I choosed a pipe with 200mm outer diameter and 3mm wall thickness. We want the plant to have enough space to grow, because, you may have already guessed it seing the picture in the beginning, maintenance is not that easy (but there are solutions) :).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHN/S73G/JIOUDPF3/FHNS73GJIOUDPF3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Choose the Plant for Your Aquapipot"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "MATERIAL: Go with acrylic :)\nThe plants needs light and water. To provide both, I will use acrylic pipes and fittings so that light shines through. However, you can also use glass pipes or something else transparent. You could even choose a non-transparent pipe if you install an artifical lightsource.\nAcrylic has a significant advantages: It is widely available in different sizes and shapes (hemispheres, plates, rings, pipes, ...), it can be glued easily and with high strength, it can be thermoformed and it is a thermoplast of which filament is available to 3D-print fittings, flanges, joints and gaskets.\nTip: If you want to build a low-budget solution PET bottles can be considered instead of acrylic pipes. Just look out for a bottle with smooth walls.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3A/SEEC/JIOU11CU/F3ASEECJIOU11CU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Choose Your Material: Best Way to Go With Acrylic"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "CONSTRUCTION: Whatever the plant needs but make it watertight!\nTo prove that the design works, I pretty much maxed out the size for my 15 sqm room. Of course you can build anything you want - bigger or smaller. But seeing this example you get the idea and you have proof of concept:\nWith a pipe 2m long and put up vertically there are some major problems you have to cope with. All in all the water itself is the problem.\nYou first want to keep it in the pipe, so you have to ensure your construction is watertight. This is more important the higher the water-level you have in your aquapot as pressure rises accordingly. E.g. in this example, you have a pressure of about 0.2 bar at the bottom due to approx. 2m water depth. You may avoid this taking a plant which grows more horizontally so you can choose and put up your pipe accordingly (maybe even horizontally).Aquatic moss would be an example.\nSecond, you may want to have some kind of water circulation with a pipe that big. It would be easy to just hang a waterpump in there, but it would not look that good and still, circulation won't be optimal. That is why I choosed to adapt a very common design for a waterpump to fit my construction: The so called air lift pump. The idea is simple: Get a pipe in parallel and let air bubbles rise through it, creating a water stream upwards. Connect it to the big pipe with the plant at the top and the bottom and voil\u00e0, let the water circulate! Also, this looks really good :D but it needs more work. You may avoid this using pipes not that long or you just by placing the air bubbler in the main pipe.\nThird, the construction itself will get quite heavy in the example. However, you can just take a smaller plant and a smaller design. Makes everything easier :)\nDESIGN: To make the design look good in the end, you have to apply your personal design taste. I want to give the pipes an industrial look with flanges and screws and so on. To be honest, there is not very much of a choice as pipes with flanges just look \"industrial\". However, you could apply color or ornaments, e.g. to get a steampunk-design.\nMAKE YOUR SKETCH! Above you see the example sketch. A very simple one indeed. But you not only see the principle of an air lift pump, you can also make out which parts you need.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUH/TIFN/JIOUDQ5E/FUHTIFNJIOUDQ5E.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Choose Your Design and Cconstruction"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The next step is getting the parts. According to your plan, this will lead to a BOM with some acrylic pipes, rings, plates and maybe even hemispheres like in the example. To connect them with each other, you need fittings and flanges you can use with the parts. These are the parts needed for the example (of course you do not need that much filament and also not that much screws):\nMaterial:\n2x 200mm hemispheres\n1x 200mm 2m pipe\n1x 50mm 2m pipe\n1x 1kg acrylic filament (PMMA from Material4Print)\n1x 250g flexible filament (White FlexiSMART from FFFworld, shore hardness 88A)\n3D Printing:\n2x 200mm glue flange\n2x 50mm glue flange\n1x 100mm glue flange\n2x 50mm glue sideflange\n1x 100mm glue sideflange\n2x 50mm flanged curved pipe\n4x 50mm flange seal\n1x 100mm flange seal\n2x 200mm flange seal\nMounting and fixiation:\n200x M4 flanged lens head screw + M4 flanged nuts (non-toothed!)\n3x 200mm clamp for wall mount\nPlant and stuff:\n1x pack of Valisneria Gigantea\napprox. 4kg fine sand\naquarium air pump (Schego WS2)\n8mm silicone tubing and bubbler\nDepending on your construction there may even be fittings readily available for your pipe-diameters. However, the more individual approach is to 3D print your own fittings, pipes, flanges and seals. The usual workflow is to go into your preferred CAD editor and start designing. However, not everyone can use a CAD editor. And also because after my studies I want to have my future flat full of aquapipots, I went for a generic solution which makes the design process of different flanges and pipe-parts much easier. In fact, everyone can profit from it: Parametrized 3D models!\nTo be honest, until now with this instructable I never made any parametrized models. At least not intentionally as somehow every part modeled with boolean operations is parametric. Because of the planters challenge I took a look at Tinkercad a few days ago. To be honest, I once had done a few months before and I had closed the window a minute later because I thought it was a fairly simple online software which does not fit my needs. However, I was put right a few days ago, realizing you can write shape generators with javascript! And that is what makes this instructable generic.\nNow I provide a few links where you see the flanges, pipes and fittings I have designed, like in the pictures. All of them are made with shape generators so they are customizable. Be patient when using the shape generator as I did not optimize the code, nor did I took a lot of care on the parameter naming. I hope it is self-explaining to some point, if not, just ask me. Here are the links to each part:\nGlue flanges and seals (just make it flat to work as seal and make the bores a little smaller, see printed seals next step)\nPipe with one or two bored flanges\nAngled pipe with flanges\n(Angled) Side Flange for glueing in a hole in the side of a pipe\nWith those parts, you should be able to substantiate your plan. I would suggest to make a 3D model if the project is a bigger one. This way you really make sure all the diameters, thicknesses, flange widths and bores match with their counterparts. With this in mind, I think it is good to tell you some errors I made during the design process:\nUse straight numbers for the bore count. If you don't, you cannot rotate the flange in 90\u00b0 steps.\nMake sure you have the right tolerances. You can see it when editing one of the glue flanges: The inner one is designed to be glued to a pipe with 50mm outer diameter and 3mm wall thickness. Notice the thickness of pipe in the sketch is 3.2mm to make it fit perfectly after 3D printing. The collar's main intend is to provide guidance when glueing and to mask up errors on the cut of the pipe. It has nearly no structural use unless you inforce it with triangles. So better take a tolerance too big than too short here.\nDouble check wheather each part fits to its counterpart\nYou may want to refine the parts using Blender or another software. It allows not only to refine meshes but also to add sweeps via the subdivision surface modifier by selecting the appropriate edge.

Also check local dealers, especially when you want to build something really big. As acrylic is a widely used material, there are online shops only selling acrylic parts like pipes, hemispheres, plates and much more in different shapes and sizes. My experience was them having more favourable and versatile offers than Ebay or Amazon.\nThe seals can be 3D printed with flexible filament by scaling down the glue flanges in Z. You can also make a silicon mold or you can buy seals.\nAnother important thing to aquire are the nuts and screws. Choose screws and nuts with (flat!) flanges or use washers instead. You also may want to get stainless parts. They look better and they are water resistant. When you are using saline water, e.g. to grow mangroves or for a marine aquarium, you better use a high-grade stainless steel which can withstand saline water.

The filament can be named differently, e.g. acrylic filament, PMMA filament or even Plexiglas filament. Unfortunately it is not as common as PLA, ABS or PETG. However, it should be no problem getting acrylic filament, maybe even coloured if you want to give the aquapipe some colour features.\nI used PMMA filament from Material4Print (M4P). I used the standard PETG settings which came with the Prusa i3 MK3 but I bumped up the hotend temperature to 260\u00b0C and the heatbed temperature to 100\u00b0C. Prints came out really nice. Possible failures or annoying things you may stumble into:\nMake sure your first layer calibration is good. Too low or to high and it will not stick - yes, also when it is too low as the neighboured layers are lifted up.\nTo improve bed adhesion use a glue stick and use a brim.\nHave an hermetically sealed enclosure or print in a well ventilated area. Acrylic smells pretty bad, even more intense than ABS. I have the misfortune to live in a dorm room so... .Just avoid the printer during printing PMMA. Go outside, have a walk, drink some tea or better make an hourlasting teaparty, you know what I mean. And leave the window open.\nDry the filament. PMMA or acrylic absorbes up to 1.x% water. If your filament makes brizzling noises during printing, dry it. Stop the print. You do not want air bubbles in your part and you do not want it to become less strong. Above there are some microscopic pictures showing a piece of extruded filament with and without air bubbles - the first was wet, the latter dry.\nPrint the parts with a lot of perimeters and 100% infill. You want the parts to be strong. Especially bores are stronger with more perimeters. I used a bit more than 10 perimeters in the example prints, with a 0.4mm nozzle.\nIf you have a bigger nozzle, use it.\nPay attention on warping. Acrylic warps quite alot although it is not like nylon or similar difficult to print filaments. It is even better than with ABS. Just use supports (strong ones!) and, if there are overhangs more than about 30 degrees, the trick is to print very slow.\nPrint the angled pipes like shown in the picture above, with a massive support.

When you have a drill press use it as it not only improves precision but also makes it easier to ensure a slow feed motion so no cracks will occur. A milling machine would be even better if you have one. However, a power drill should also work. Just drill slow and with less pressure/slow feed(!).\nAlso drill the bores for the flange which are not 3D printed. In the example these are the two hemisphere flanges.

Acrylic is highly allergic to that.\nSo better increase saw speed and dedcrease feed motion. Also make sure to use the right saw blades, e.g. blades suitable for PVC. Blades for metal will be ok too.

Stay away from the usual adhesives you use for paper and wood. Also, do not rely on resin or other fancy adhesives. Use adhesive for acrylic :)\nGlueing the parts is more difficult than it seems. I would even say it is the most difficult step in this instructable: Too much glue and the bond seam looks bad, too little glue and it may be leaky and has decreased stability. In fact, better use to much glue than too little.\nThe collars on the flanges make glueing much easier as they hide the bond seam. But still it is a difficult job you may want to learn via practice on several examples before. If you need to wipe away glue leavings, DO NOT do it with your fingers nor do it with a towel or anything else which has no smooth surface! Use wrapping film or a scraper instead. This way, even when glue mets a visible surface, it will stay transparent and glossy so you will hardly notice it on the finished aquapipot.\nHowever, I would only wipe away glue deposits in case of an emergency, e.g. when a glue drop begins to flow over visible surfaces. Here are some pictures of the glued example aquapipot.\nThe latter two pictures are quite important: They show the alignment of the two glue flanges to the angled pipes of the air lift pump.

As said, I live in a dorm room and yes, there are possiblities. You don't need a few thousand dollar tempering oven. All you need is a wardrobe large enough to fit your parts in (I used an IKEA PAX) and a modified fan heater which allows reaching temperatures up to 80 \u00b0C. You also may want a PID to regulate the fan heater, but you can also do it manually.\nFirst clear your wardrobe so that it is empty providing enough space for your parts. Place your parts in it. The best way is to hang them up on a wire or so. It was very tight fit for the big pipe but it works, see the pictures.\nI used a PID first but then switched to manual control as the modified fan heater was switched on and off absolutely, which means the air convection stopped and the temperature difference between up and down inside the PAX became unacceptable.

This is my first \"Instructables\" and also the submission for the planters challenge.\nIn order to come up with the planter design, I tried to incorporate few very trending things in the DIY communities:\n1. 3D printer\n2. LEDs\n3. Magnets\n4. Craft\nAfter spending considerable amount of time brainstorming, I decided to this self-watering planter that can work as a desktop planter with LEDs illuminating it and also as a fridge magnet if you are too tired of the usual souvenir magnets that your friend/family/neighbor gave you of places you have probably never been to. And who wouldn't want to a put a nice planter on a fridge, right?\nAlongside, I also wanted to make it wirefree (when used as a desktop planter) with a fancy switching mechanism. Instead of turning an ON/OFF switch (who wants switches anyways!), I came up with a simple mechanism where if you connect the light and electronic case to the planter, the LEDs automatically turns on and if you detach it, the LEDs turn off. Now that's convenient!\nAnd let's all be honest: keeping plants are fun but watering is an added chore that anybody would want to put aside. For that reason, I also incorporated the self watering mechanism to keep the soil moist and hydrated for few days.\nNow, all these seem like the project will need loads of things and a long time to make. However, that is not the case. I have tried to keep this project as simple as possible to make and with things that you have lying around in your house (assuming you are a DIYer and have a 3D printer). If not, a single order from amazon or couple of trips to dollarstore and an electronic store will suffice.\nWith all these said, let's look at all the materials that are needed:\n1. 3D printer + filament spools (depend on your colour preference).\n2. 3D printed parts (planter, water reservoir plate, LED and electronics holder and cover).\n3. Epoxy\n4. Oil colours\n5. Hot glue gun\n6. Jute rope\n7. Superglue\n8. Wire (you can use the wires from CAT5 cable)\n9. Battery (9V battery)\n10. LED strip\n11. Magnets (x8 ceramic magnets 0.709\" x 0.197\" disc + x4 neodymium magnet 1/8\" x 1/16\" disc)\n12. Soldering iron\n13. Multimeter\n14.

Seeing as I want the planter to be modular I wanted each individual unit to be quite small and easy to print. The design considerations I debated over are as follows:\nThe basic shape came from a honeycomb pattern, as each individual hexagon can fit in with as many others as you like. Thus you can start the set one plant at a time and there is no need to have loads of them from the get go.\nI wanted the planters to be both usable on their own or as groups; either on a bench, table or suspended. Thus I put holes in the design such that they can be tied together as groups, suspended one under another or suspended as a group. These holes needed to be outside the edges of the pot so that it doesn't leak.\nThe planters need to be waterproof so that they don't leak onto the windowsill/table when you put them down or drip onto the floor when you hang them. This is relatively easy to do if your print settings are right but means you need to be careful not to over water your plants.\nSeedlings can dry out quickly if you forget to water them for a day or two and if you water too vigorously you can wash away the seeds before they sprout. So I designed a simple hydroponics system where you put water into a separate container, it travels along a string and waters from the base up into the soil.\nThe planters need to be easy to print and not require any support material such that it doesn't require much post print clean-up or waste any plastic. To do this when I designed the planter I made sure there weren't any big overhangs and the holes were more triangular than round so that there aren't bridging points that need supports.\nTo simplify the design I made it so you tie the planters together rather than have a rigid connection so the designs look simple and allow for a degree of error with the actual prints.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 3: Design Considerations"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "I built the model using Tinkercad. I have used Tinkercad for a while now as it was the simplest free software I found and lets me build simple models quite quickly. I am not an expert with the software but I can give you some of the tips and tricks I have picked up while using it.\nOne of the main things to keep in mind is that Tinkercad is a shape editor, so you build up your model from a series of simple shapes merged together. This can be challenging with very complex shapes unless you can imagine a creative way to put them together. For my model I wanted it to be based off a hexagon but the best way I could imaging putting it together was to build up an individual wall and then duplicate it to make the complete model.\nI played around for a while to get my first version of my model, which took quite a while as I was still trying to rough out the size of everything and how to put it together. I then modified it to get the second version which I was happy with and then I rebuilt it again from scratch to get the final version. This final version was the one I documented as it was the way I put the model together minus all the tweaks and changes made during the first couple of drafts.\nEnough rambling, onto the actual steps I followed. I will go over everything in the same order as my screenshots, not focusing on the dimension but rather the process (when I use a Tinkercad function I will underline it):\nStarting with a basic hexagon (the built in polygon function set to 6 sides), I scaled it up to the desired size\nI added a wedge and stretched it to match the hexagons width before setting the height. I used a wedge as I wanted the sides to be tapered outwards. I then hid (Ctrl +H) the hexagon so it wouldn't get in the way.\nI set the wedge to be a hole on its properties tab and moved the workplane to the slanted side of the wedge. Onto this side of the wedge I added a rectangle that will become the wall of my planter. I set the corner of my rectangle to match my wedge and set it to have a thin height and a width the same as the height of my wedge. This is quite simple to do either by stretching the corner of the shape or using the ruler tool, selecting the wedge to see its dimensions then selecting the block and typing in the same dimensions.\nI then returned the workplane to its default floor before adding in another wedge to reinforce the top corners of my hexagon. I rotated the shape to face upwards and set it to the same height as the wedge. I stretched the sides until they looked right and matched its corner to that of the wedge. Rather than making another one from scratch I just Ctrl + C (copy) and Ctrl +V (paste) another one which I placed on the other side. Seeing as the wedge is set to a hole when I group the shapes the bottom of it will be removed.\nAs the base for one of the walls is done it is time to duplicate them to make the hexagon. Simply select all the objects and press Ctrl + D (duplicate), this makes another set of objects in the exact same place and auto selects them (be careful not to make several duplicates by mistake). The duplicate I rotated by 180 degrees and moved it away to form the opposite sides wall. Now we have two walls.\nRather than making the other walls and struggling to get them to the right spot all you need to do is select both opposite walls and duplicate them again. This time once they are duplicated rotate them by 60 degrees. If you press Ctrl + D to duplicate them again Tinkercad will automatically make the duplicate and rotate it by another 60 degrees to make the remaining walls (it repeats the action you did with the last duplicate). You now have all the sides done.\nNow to put a floor onto the shape I unhid/showed all shapes by pressing Ctrl + Shift + H, I set the ruler to use the mid-point measurement (click on the circle of the ruler to switch between edge or mid-point) and selecting all the walls I could see the mid point then when I selected the hexagon I set it to match the walls.\nWe now have a planter that could be grouped with others, but I still wanted to add holes to hang it from and a spout to water it with.\nFirst I added some tall skinny cylinders to two opposite corners then just like sides I duplicated and rotated them to get all the corners. I left them tall so I could see that they lined up but these are actually the holes for the base hexagon. I turned them into holes and hid (Ctrl + H) them before grouping (Ctrl + G) all the wall shapes together. Now when the are unhid (Ctrl +Shift +H) they can be seen with the walls and floor.\nTime to add a spout. I placed the workplane onto one of the walls and placed a pyramid onto it. This pyramid I then cut in half by grouping it with a hole rectangle and stretched to the desired shape.\nTo make the spout hollow I duplicated the shape, made it into a hole and made it slightly smaller. When I grouped the hollow shape and spout I now had the spout walls done but no hole in the wall for it.\nI hid (Ctrl +H) the spout walls and placed a triangle hole at the desired height. I used a triangular hole as this does not need any form of support when 3D printed. I checked the hole relative to the spout before grouping (Ctrl +G) the walls and hole. The spout is now complete.\nAll that is left is to add the top holes. I shrunk the base holes down so they were out of the way. I then moved the workplane to an inside edge and added a pentagon hole to the surface. I made sure the holes centre matched the shapes centre, I then duplicated and rotated it so that holes went through all sides.\nYou now just need to group everything together and you have a Modular Seedling Planter.\nMy steps are easiest to follow if you follow along in the pictures.

This plastic is quite hard to get your printer settings right, but produces great prints which are strong, durable, and flexible. PETG also has the great property of being food safe and the one I'm using is UV stable so it should be fine in the sun. As PETG has a high melting point you get a strong bond between layers.\nYou also need to think about your print settings such that the walls and base are solid, so that the planter doesn't leak. Also if your retraction settings are right you won't need any clean up afterwards as the models are designed to be printed without any support material.\nAll you do now is take your model and import it into your desired slicer program and slice the model. I use Repetier-Host and Slic3r.\nThese models are quite small so they don't use much plastic but as they have a large amount of surface area and I print surfaces quite slowly each container took about 3 hrs to print. I made a time-lapse of a print so you can watch one of the planters grow. This is my first time making one of these time lapses but they do look quite cool as they turn 3 hours into 50 seconds.\nIf you plan on having a full set of planters I would recommend also printing the water container. This allows you to use a basic hydroponics system to water your seeds and keep them happy.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FH0/8GVI/JIAJOQMP/FH08GVIJIAJOQMP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLK/0Y0A/JIAJOQO1/FLK0Y0AJIAJOQO1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEA/W0DG/JIAJOQN6/FEAW0DGJIAJOQN6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWU/QZIW/JIKK0Z81/FWUQZIWJIKK0Z81.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Printing the Model"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Time for some gardening.\nThe first thing to do is check that your planter is watertight. If your planter leaks you need to be careful what surface you leave it on or where you hang it. A simple fix for leaky planter is to give it a coat of clear spray paint or take a little glue and full the hole up.\nNow if you are going to be using the watering system you need to take a piece of cotton string and push it down through the spout. The string needs to be long enough that it can go from the base of your planter to the top and down to the bottom again, I make the string slightly too long as you can always cut it shorter later. This string will be the tongue that drinks from the water container.\nNext, I put a little square of newspaper in to act as a sleeve for the planter. The idea being that this makes it is easier to take the plants out when they are no longer seedlings. You don't have to put the newspaper in as the planters are tapered the plant should come out relatively easily.\nTake some soil and full your planter 3/4 full. I used the compressed soil that needed to be re-hydrated first. Sprinkle some seeds onto the soil and cover with more soil until the planter is almost full.\nGive the planter a quick watering and your seed is well on its way to growing up big and strong.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F70/W7FV/JIKK10F9/F70W7FVJIKK10F9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0X/2ZK4/JIKK10G5/F0X2ZK4JIKK10G5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNP/LOQV/JIKK10H4/FNPLOQVJIKK10H4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FST/0BTB/JIOU2OHS/FST0BTBJIOU2OHS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX1/SD59/JIOU2OK4/FX1SD59JIOU2OK4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8D/WKO7/JIKK10HZ/F8DWKO7JIKK10HZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9C/X7IO/JIKK10JO/F9CX7IOJIKK10JO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRA/IS9O/JIKK10KM/FRAIS9OJIKK10KM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F54/YJXV/JIKK10N9/F54YJXVJIKK10N9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5Q/SBAX/JIKK10P2/F5QSBAXJIKK10P2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0Q/68O3/JIKK10Q0/F0Q68O3JIKK10Q0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAT/7SE5/JIKK10UK/FAT7SE5JIKK10UK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Planting You Seeds"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "The planters are designed to be modular parts of groups of six.

See the photos as it is kinda hard to explain. A small wire hook makes the threading a whole lot easier.\nOnce all the planters are threaded pull the string tight carefully and tie the two ends together. If you don't want to hang your planters all you need to do is add to the water pot and your are done.\nTo hang the planters what you do is thread a loop from the base holes of two adjacent planters through the two holes at the top and tie it off. Make sure to leave a long length of extra string as it will be used to suspend the planter. Repeat this threading step for each spot between the planter so that you will have all the planters tied to each other and six long strings.\nAs the planters are tied together you should notice that they will be held quite rigidly in place. Take the six long strings and hold them above the planters centre. Decide how tall the hanging point needs to be and tie all the loops together at that height.

When you have small seedlings it is easy to forget to water them for a day and to come home and see them roasted by the sun. Also when watering right on top of tiny seeds you run the risk of washing them away. Hence make a gentle self watering system.\nThe watering system is made up of a small water container that fits in the middle of the ring of planters. The cotton strings that were placed into the planters go into this container and when they get wet the water flows along them and into the base of the planter. All you need to do is full the container once every day or two, depending on the weather.\nTo get the system working; start by printing the water spout file and making sure that it too doesn't leak. Next take the group of planters and carefully move the cotton tongues out the way. Slot the water container into place and put each string into the slot of the water container.

Overly high RPM can cause engine noise as well as loss of Fuel Efficiency, whereas overly low RPM can cause engine lugging and loss of engine power. The gear ratios need to be very carefully designed considering the vehicle weight, engine torque and power curves, intended drivability and performance parameters and of course intended fuel economy.\nThis part is very simple.

Be cautious since with rotary tools it is possible plastic to melt from heat.\nCut frames backplate 0,5cm smaller than planters top\nGlue backplate to planter (i used small screws to hold it since i was having trouble keeping the backplate to desired place)\nCut the reeds using a saw to few cm larger than planter height.

On the long end i preferred to leave some wood outside the \"box\".\nSince this box is not stable enough to continue i added a \"cross\" for support and four small sticks on the sides so my hut floor to be placed.\nMeasure 2 sticks a bit larger than with the existing ones on short edge of your created box and mark them with a pencil.\nPlace them on the short sides\nMeasure 1 stick that will fit between the short sides sticks you just glued and cut it.. if it is a bit bigger use a sanding paper until the size is correct.\nFor the front side, we need to leave space for a door. Cut a small stick and glue it. Leave a space that it looks normal for a door and place a stick to the rest.\nNext the long sticks must go to the long edge and continue with the same way.. short edge-long edge -sort egde\nWhen you create the first 2-3 rows of your walls measure the inside of your hut and cut flat sticks for the flooring. It is better to do it early so it is easier to put them to place. I used sanding paper again in order to make small adjustments.\nWhen i reached the fifth row i decided it was a good height to have windows. As with the door, cut smaller sticks and place them to create your windows (this was the most time consuming part since you need lots of small sticks)\nWhen you reach desired height of windows start placing full sticks.\nRoof\nNext part was the roof.\nMeasure the short side of your hut and cut a stick longer than that so your roof ends outside of your walls (on my hut size it was around 2 cm bigger)\nCut another stick smaller by 4 stick tops than the previous one. You can measure it like the photo below.\nI started with 2 stick tops smaller but i end up with a very high roof as you can see in photos.. so for most cases .. 4 sticks will be fine.\nCut again a smaller stick (by 4) than the previous one until you end up with a few mm stick (for the top)\nNow you should have a set of sticks that can form a triangle. Cut another set with the same dimensions.those two will be the sides of our roof.\nStart with the larger stick and center the next one and glue it (on flat surface). Continue gluing the rest of the sticks and do the same with the other set.\nUntil the two triangles set, we must cut our beams. Each beam must have the same size as the long edge of our hut. Cut as many sticks as the \"steps\" of each triangle.\nPut the two sets vertically (this is a bit tricky to put them vertically and stay there) and glue the first beam on the lower step of the triangles. Now glue the second on the exact opposite direction.\nGlue the next stick to the higher step and the next one to the exact opposite.\nI find it much easier using small boxes to keep the triangles in place until the glue of the first 4-6 sticks set and roof start keeping its shape.\nContinue by gluing the rest of the sticks on each step.\nMeasure and cut the edges of flat sticks so the end of the flat stick touches on beam and the beam below is roughly at the middle of flat part. I preferred to keep the rounded edges of the flat sticks, but you can also cut them if you like it). Test fit them before you start gluing them.\nGlue the first row and when glue sets continue with the second one. At the top there we have two options, cut the flat pieces with angle so the fit or just but a beam (as i did)\nFinally if you dont want to glue permanent the roof to your hut, you can create \"stops\" by adding beams on the bottom of your roof so it does not fall. measure your beams with your hut perimeter of your top side of your hut.\nBase of hut\nI did not wanted my hut to be at the soil directly so i created a base.\nI align on a flat surface flat sticks and measure it so they are bigger than my hut few mm from the sides of the hut, and few cm on the front so i can create a balcony.\nI glued horizontal flat sticks to keep them in place. when glue was set, using sand paper i sanded the edges to be roughly level. I glued 4 more flat sticks around my base so it has some height from the ground.\nPut it all to together\nwhen all parts are completed put them together without gluing them so you can see the fit.

This is where the water will be held, where the pump will be, and where the fountain will drain into. It has a slot in the back for the pump's power cord. The top part is a rectangle that I cut the top off at an angle. This gives the slope the water will need to run down. I added a cylindrical area to the top where the fountain will be. The water will then flow down the track and over the edge. I used a voronoi shape generator to create a \"rock\" effect for the water to trickle down. The top is shorter (in length) than the bottom, so there will be room for the water to fall into the reservoir.

Well, if you have ever tried to find a perfect sphere it\u2019s not easy! I bought ball after ball and cut them open. Nope, not smooth enough. Basket balls have wierd seam lines inside. Other balls shrink to a limp skin. Plastic orbs are next to impossible to find\u2026 Soooo, I had to do what I usually do; make one.\nMy \u2018Go-To\u2019 method of making a mold always seems to save me.\nWhat you need to make the Giant Geode Planter Mold\nOne box of corn starch\nOne tube of 100% Silicone Caulking\nOld bowl\nGloves and good ventilation (super smelly stuff!)\nCaulking gun, knife to cut it open\nA smooth well inflated ball (cheap kids play-ball)\nHave your \u2018master\u2019 ball ready by sitting on a bowl for stability. Squeeze the entire tube into the bottom of the bowl that is well filled with the corn starch. The intention is to keep it suspended in the starch so that it does not start to stick on the sides. Keep it in one mass, tossing and working in more starch so to get less and less sticky. Try to keep a layer of starch between it and your fingers as well.\nAfter it absorbs more and more starch it will start to become moldable as it won\u2019t stick to the fingers as much. This is so much like making a dough (I guess my years working at a bakery helped!).\nRoll in your hands to make a ball of even consistency.\nFlatten the \u2018dough\u2019 on a flat surface that has a dusting of corn starch to about 1/4\u2033 thick.\nThe mix starts to set pretty quickly so immediately place it over your form ball and smooth it out. Do not worry about the edges or excess. I was aiming to have a good 1/2 of the ball or bit more covered. It will usually set with in 30 minutes I find.

It has to have some character, I\u2019ve always marvelled at the way that lava rock is made, cooled lava from a real volcano. It is available as the internal rock for BBQ\u2019s and also as a landscape type mulch. I used both types, but the bagged lava rock was larger and more colourful.\nWhich Concrete Mix to use:\nI am always trying to get so much done (life of a blogger & maker) so I am happiest if I can use one of my quickset concrete mixes. I used the Quikrete Fastset Allcrete on this project but the Rapidset Cementall will also work here (it ends up lighter colour) Both these mixes can work at various consistencies. I did try a few variations and the results were all great.\nIf you would rather not see the any of the stones in the final form you can mix a very fluid mix and let it run between the rocks that line the mold. If you want to see more of the rocks you can use it more as a thicker mortar and just have it between the rocks.\nYou should experiment\u2026 I did realize that it is strong and holds the rocks together even if there are some empty voids.\nThe Method:\nThis is not a perfection type of orb, it has a lot of character and will be quite unique. There is somewhat of an element of magic here as to how it turns out; but that is what makes it so refreshingly unique.\nThe ingenious thing about a sphere is that you can work in partial portions since IS all the same curve!

Trust me on this. :D\nAnything they can get to will be touched, dragged, pulled, chewed, humped, spit on, and maybe even peed on if you aren't paying attention. And some of those things are sure to be dangerous to the puppy!\nSo instead of chasing your pup around all day or realizing there's a sudden silence and you don't see the puppy around and then panicking - puppy proof in advance! It's good for both for your sanity and the safety of the puppy.\nPuppy proofing can also help with house training when combined with crating when you're not home and containing your puppy when you are home!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FR3/TW6P/JIETZT8S/FR3TW6PJIETZT8S.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Why You Should Puppy Proof Your Home"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "These areas will include the living room, dining room, and any hallways, as these areas are generally larger and hard to be blocked off completely with the use of baby gates and pens.\nHere are some general hazards to look out for:\nCORDS: Hide cords behind furniture, or tack them to the wall with cable clips. Secure excess hanging cord with zip ties.\nCHARGERS: Chargers are especially dangerous because they can be broken into smaller pieces. Keep them on surfaces that are out of reach and zip tie the excess cable.\nHOUSEPLANTS: Many plants are toxic to plants and dogs. (Some may cause upset stomach, some cause severe swelling, and some can be fatal. Check here for more information.) Hang plants or put them on counters or the tops of shelves.\nELECTRICAL OUTLETS: Invest in outlet covers if your puppy seems too interested! You can also buy outlet covers that cover the cords that are plugged in - just in case you puppy decides pulling cords out of the wall i is their new favorite game.\nRIPPED OR TORN FLOORING: Little pieces of string from rugs and carpets can become a fun game while you're not watching. (The corner of a crappy carpet in our hallway is one of our only puppy causalities.) Vinyl or wooden flooring with exposed damage can become a chew toy.\nSMALL OBJECTS: If you're a fan of knickknacks or have open storage on low shelves, move those items up and out of the puppy's reach. Anything tiny enough to go in the mouth will be in the mouth.\nTALL OBJECTS: Anything wobbly and tall should be secured to the walls. If an item can't be secured to the walls, try leaning it into a corner or weighting it so it can't be knocked over.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0Q/CLR4/JIETZULV/F0QCLR4JIETZULV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Puppy Proofing General Living Areas"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "A bathroom contains quite a bit for such a tiny room!

Alternatively, set them on the toilet tank.\nRUGS AND TOWELS: These are quite easy to tear up, even for a young puppy. Keep an eye on your puppy anytime they're around them.\nLITTERBOXES: If you have cats, chances are you've got a litterbox in your bathroom somewhere. I recommend getting a top-entry litterbox if you don't have one already! Litter can cause significant and dangerous blockages in a puppy's intestinal tract, and eating cat feces can be dangerous as well.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ4/RBRE/JIETZT4N/FZ4RBREJIETZT4N.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Puppy Proofing Your Bathroom"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "You may choose to simply keep bedrooms closed during house training or until the puppy has learned not to chew on everything. But since Charlie's crate is in our bedroom and he spends time in there with us at night, we decided to puppy proof it.\nBedrooms aren't the most dangerous places, but it's important to be mindful about keeping cords and chargers away and organized. You'll also want to keep closets and drawers shut to keep the puppy from rooting around and finding trouble. I also keep my bedroom plants out of his reach.\nHere are some other things to look out for:\nLAUNDRY BASKETS: Eating laundry can lead to blockages and vet visits, so it's important to move the laundry somewhere safe or teach the puppy immediately that the laundry basket is a no-go.\nSHOES: Shoes are especially tempting for puppies - they're like big toys! Keep shoes on a shoe rack or in a closet to make them less accessible.\nCLOTHING: Make sure any clothing is either put away or in the laundry basket. A puppy is sure to love your smell and will seek out stray socks, underwear, and anything else left within reach.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJM/SX1P/JIETZSX9/FJMSX1PJIETZSX9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Puppy Proofing Bedrooms"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The kitchen has so many tempting things.

As for recycling bins, I recommend keeping them up out of reach or even moving them outside of a back door. You never want to encourage digging in the trash or recycling.\nFLOORS: I try to keep the floors in the kitchen swept often, as you don't want to create a scavenger pup that roams the kitchen at every chance looking for scraps. You may be cooking with ingredients puppy can't digest, so it's important they aren't eating random things off the floor!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2C/EQTK/JIETZSTF/F2CEQTKJIETZSTF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Puppy Proofing the Kitchen"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Making Your Yard Safe\nIf you're lucky enough to have a fenced in yard, have a walk around and pick up anything you don't want in the puppy's mouth.

I never know what trash may blow into the yard from neighbors' trashcans or what previous tenants have left out there. I may live in the middle of nowhere, but I find so many strange things in my yard I don't want my dogs getting ahold of. (Though let's be honest, mostly beer cans and golf balls.)\n\nMaking Your Garage Safe\nTo be honest, we tend to keep Charlie out of the garage entirely. We have more of a warehouse than a garage and there are so many dangerous things in there: power tools, paint, glass, pvc, heavy hand tools, scrap wood, auto fluids, etc.\n\nBut if you know your pup has a chance of being in there, I recommend buying some cheap metal or plastic shelves to keep dangerous liquids out of reach. You'll also want to either secure tools and materials scraps to the walls using racks or keep an eye on the pup at all times.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWD/JC64/JIETZSPS/FWDJC64JIETZSPS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Puppy Proofing Your Yard and Garage"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "It's my firm belief that a puppy should either be crated, contained, or within your eye line on a leash at all times! (With the minority of that time spent crated if possible - Charlie mostly sleeps in his at night or when we leave the house.)\nIt's not a puppy's fault for chewing and getting into things: they're just being curious! It's your job to keep them safe via crating or containing, or by being nearby while they're leashed to tell them no and teach them that's not ok.\nCRATING\nAs stated above, Charlie really only spends time in his crate while we sleep at night or if we're gone during the day. We crate him because it greatly speeds up house training and keeps him and our house safe when we're not able to watch him.\n\nCONTAINING\nYou can buy puppy \"play pens\" that will allow you to keep the puppy close and give them room to run around a bit. We got one for Charlie early on so I could work. I would put his bed, food, water and some toys inside and he'd keep himself busy for a bit. This was especially great because I could set it up on our tiled kitchen floor to avoid cleaning up accidents on carpet.\nYou can also buy a couple baby gates and install those. We use one to block off the kitchen and living room from the rest of the house.\n\nLEASHING\nCharlie is often on a leash, both inside and outside. When Charlie was very young and tended to pee every 15 minutes, I kept him on an eight foot leash attached to my belt loop via a carabiner. This allowed me to move around the house and do what I needed to do while watching him. It's easy to tell if he's squatting or getting into something this way!\n\nOutside, we keep a 30 foot leash on Charlie in most cases. This gives him the freedom to run, but won't let him get too far away. This is especially important if you have an unfenced yard and when the puppy is very young and hasn't learned to come to you yet.\n\nI also employed the 30 foot leash in teaching Charlie to recall (or come to me) consistently. When he didn't listen, I'd tug at the leach while saying \"Charlie, come!\" and reward him with an enthusiastic \"Yes!\" we he turned to come to me. And of course I gave him a treat every time. :D", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FEL/TEX8/JIETZV1I/FELTEX8JIETZV1I.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: How to Keep Puppy Safe When You Are and Aren't at Home"}], "channel": "Pets"}, {"category": "Home", "description": "Lassi is a popular traditional curd-based drink widely used in India during the summer.

The Challenge. Big windows provide wonderful light. Problem is that at night they allow anyone passing by to look into the house. Even if you don't need them for privacy you are losing a lot of light to what becomes a 'dark void' once the sun sets. So you need screening... blinds, curtains, shades\nTraditional shades. They require daily attention and always have a cluttered look.\nPrivacy Screens. A clean, modern solution. Anyone can install with the most basic household tools.\nAs a General Contractor... in san francisco we were always asked to install privacy screens for offices and conference rooms. After passing on the fee of $400+ per window (yes, sf was pricey even 10 years ago) I decided to jump in and start applying film.

No need to buy a custom tool.\nOptional Materials (shown in photo):\nSqueegee - I bought this little guy 10 years ago and only used it for installing film. It was important to my clients that the installation was dust free... honestly, not necessary if you use newspaper to clean the window first. Probably should actually bring it into the shower for cleaning the glass... (here's a mini squeegee at $13)\nCutting Surface - always handy for crafts\nRuler - just need a way to transfer approximate dimensions\nApplication Tool Kit - this $10 application kit is worth a look but not worth buying... shown here.

I never found it necessary but if you're doing a few and don't mind the expense ($15+) you may find it worth it.\nIf you want to buy in bulk you won't find on amazon.

It can depend on the mould shape, the size, how much detail there is and how thick you personally want it to be.

It's going to depend on your oven how long it's going to take. General recommendations are 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C/Gas Mark 6. It's going to depend on how your oven behaves. With my oven (gas) I have it on as hot as possible as it tends to run cooler than it should, and then check every 10 minutes to see what progress has been made. It usually takes between 10 to 20 minutes for them to melt. Once you have a non-lumpy, shiny surface, you should be good to remove the mould from the oven. If you find you haven't put enough beads in and can see the bottom of the mould in places, you can drop a few more in now then leave it in the oven for longer.\nWhen they're done, take them out. If you're putting a hole in at this stage, see the next step. Otherwise, leave them to harden for about 10 minutes, then you can pop them out of the mould. Be careful, because the mould can still be hot at this point, so handle carefully or wait until it's cooled properly (especially if kids are involved).\nBecause this is a quick and dirty home DIY project using cheap craft bits you may have to hand, you're not going to get perfection - expect some bubbles here and there.

The thing to remember here is that the rapid spinning of the drill bit against an object causes friction and so generates heat. As these are plastic, it will cause the stuff getting drilled out to melt and then harden on the drill bit. There's probably some way to do this without causing that, but I don't have much to do with drills. Instead, I recommend that you use some cheap as chips drill bits from a discount store that you don't mind messing up.

If I hadn't had the material on hand, I would have made the steps 12-inches wide (instead of sixteen), and I think this could be made from a single 24- by 48-inch piece of 3/4-inch plywood.\nTools and Materials:\nOne-half sheet of 3/4-inch plywood (I used Baltic birch, which is pricey, but any plywood would do with the right finish).\nJigsaw\nRotary saw\nSquare -- I also used a speed square, but you can get by with a carpenter's square.\nMarking pens\nUtility knife\nPocket hole jig\nAbout 50 1 1/4- inch stainless steel pocket hole screws (if you're using hardwood, like Baltic birch, get the fine thread screws).\nOrbital sander and sandpaper (various grits).\nVarious clamps\nOutdoor urethane sealer and brushes.\n2-Foot length of carpet runner (cut in quarters to cover the four steps).\nHeavy duty stapler and mallet\nContact cement\n2-Foot long piece of \"Dual Lock\" fastener material (It works like velcro, but instead of hooks and loops it just has only one side. Two pieces of this material will lock to each other. Velcro would probably work, but I had this so I'm using it.)\nNote: I put this project together using a pocket hole jig. I'm not shilling for the manufacturer, I just think they are a quick and easy way to knock a project together. Because I also plan on using the steps myself, I decided to add cleats under each step, which sort of makes the pocket hole jig superfluous. I do think these make really strong joints, and the cleats under the steps may not have been necessary, I just didn't want to take a chance. The upshot is that you don't really need to use a pocket hole jig at all, you can just screw on the cleats and screw the steps to the cleats.", "title": "Dog Steps", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Dog-Steps-1/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Cut two, 6-inch wide by 48-inch long pieces for the sides, and four 7 1/2-inch by 16-inch steps. Also, cut a couple of 4-inch by 16-inch braces, and three sets of 1-inch by 6 1/2-inch \"cleats\" to add support under the steps. If you started with a good, square 16-inch wide strip of plywood, you can cut all the steps and brace pieces from that strip and all will fit flush between the side pieces. It's not important that steps and braces be any particular length, but they must all be the same length. I cut the steps from various pieces leftover from another project, and it was really hard to get perfectly square cuts on the short pieces using a circular saw. Tiny variations in squareness and length made it impossible to get the final frame perfectly square. If I decide I can't live with the skewness, I may just add a few more strips of carpet where the steps rest on the tailgate.\nIn retrospect, I wish I had just used a fresh piece of wood. I don't like using the heavy circular saw, but that's what I have so I take my time and try to make the setups, as square as possible, clamping a jig next to the line to get a straight cut. Just be sure you're cutting on the right side of the line for your measurements. Also, to keep the wood from splintering, don't set the depth of the cut too deep. The jig I'm using in the pictures is one I made after watching the guys on \"This Old House\" make one. I'm sure there are instructables here describing how to make a jig like this for your circular saw.\nOnce you have the parts cut, lay out where your steps will be attached. I made each step 8-inches high, including the 3/4-inch board for the step. One of the pictures shows how I used a carpenter's square with a speed square to measure up 8-inches from the back of each step to the front of the next step. Lay out the four steps, drawing lines for the top and bottom of each tread. Trim the ends of the side pieces to make a notch where the steps will rest on the tailgate.\nI made the top part, where the steps lean against the tailgate, 1 3/4-inches wide to allow for the step, plus the 1-inch cleat. I think this will be plenty of material to support the weight of the dog or a person (okay, I'll admit that I'm also planning to use these steps to get in and out of the pickup). You can round the ends or make straight cuts, as suits you. Remember, though, if you trim any wood from the lower corner, where the steps meet the ground, you will be changing the height and angle of your steps. My tailgate is 33-inches off the ground; I measured 33-inches outward, from a spot directly below the edge of the tailgate to make a 45-degree angle. It happens that this was pretty close to 48-inches (with the added thickness for the top step). If your tailgate is at a different height, you will need to change the length or angle of the steps.\nA good check at this point is to park on level ground and lean a cut-out side piece against the tailgate. Use a level to find out the angle your steps need to be at, relative to the side piece, to be level. Draw a line. Make that your angle for all the steps.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTV/M6HA/JIAJWLAU/FTVM6HAJIAJWLAU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX4/FWI9/JIAJWLAX/FX4FWI9JIAJWLAX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX8/JOSZ/JIAJWL72/FX8JOSZJIAJWL72.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMA/N75Q/JIAJWL6T/FMAN75QJIAJWL6T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9U/GRPS/JIAJWLAW/F9UGRPSJIAJWLAW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5N/N5RR/JIAJWL6P/F5NN5RRJIAJWL6P.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Mark and Cut the Plywood"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I bought a pocket hole jig a while back, and it seems like every project provides an opportunity to use this simple setup.

The pocket hole jig makes a strong joint, but I don't trust it to support my weight on these steps. The cleats add sufficient support to make me feel secure.\nI drilled three pocket holes on the underside of each end of each step. Similarly, the brace pieces, that will be attached inside the lower edge of the side pieces, get a couple of holes at each end.

Most of the step is going to be covered with carpet, but get the edges where the carpet doesn't cover.\nI sanded everything with 80-grit paper, then went over the side pieces with 40-grit, and something finer that I don't remember. They came out nice and smooth. I didn't sand the step pieces very much, as they will be covered with carpet.\nWhen you're done sanding, wipe the parts down with a cloth. I put some mineral spirits on my cloth because that's what an old carpenter told me to do.\nI put one coat of outdoor urethane on each side, being careful to get all the edges.

In this way it created a comfortable fit at the top and bottom of where the pole inserted into the post. Therefore if I really needed to, the whole structure could be lifted off the 4 poles. No pole to post fixing was required - the structure weight is enough to keep it all stable.

I've actually finished something before the birthday arrives (usually its days/weeks/years...later).\nMy wife's happy - the roses will have something to grow up and the arbour gives structure to the garden.\nOn the whole I think the project went well and I plan to build a \u2018narrower\u2019 one as well at some stage - all part of my wife's design. I like the different colours of the oiled woods as they're different hardwoods and how this contrasts with the painted structure - it will soften up once greenery is enveloping it. Still uncertain about the ground fixing /pole method but its very sturdy so time will tell. Working with recycled wood is time consuming but if you put time into the prep then the end result is better, and at least the wood isn\u2019t going into landfill. Generally my philosophy is if you make a mistake or have an issue you have 3 choices - start again, cover it up or make a feature out of it. Usually the last 2 work. If you're buying softwoods that are exterior grade and pretty much the sizes you need then build time would be halved and the cost would still be lower than a mass produced one. The steel spike post fixing method would work fine - just develop a \u2018skirting\u2019 to cover it up.\nJust to let you know even the hardwood offcuts I can\u2019t use gets passed to someone else who will use them in his projects.

I expect if you're jumping into the project you have a few laying around... also great to stop into your local Habitat Restore.\nI used an old cabinet door for this most recent version. I used a waterproof paint to protect the door and the entire hutch. The paint is use for surfaces exposed to standing water.

When I first started, I was opening the freezer door what felt like every 10 minutes. Since i've timed it out, luckily, you don't have to do that! Woot!\nLeave the bowl of oil in the freezer for 60 minutes.\nRemove the bowl from the freezer (At this point, it will have the beginnings of a white film on the top)\nUsing your hand mixer, at high speed, mix the oils very well. 3-4 minutes. At the end of this first mixing, the oils will begin to look opaque, but still liquid.\nPut the bowl back in the freezer for 15 Minutes.\nRemove Bowl from freezer and mix well. It will be a brighter color, and will be harder on top, but blended, will look like garlic butter sauce.\nAdd in your aroma oils of choice! For a batch this size, I use a full 10 ml. bottle of essential oils. Pour in the oil and mix for another minute. I decided to use a premixed blend from Lotus Touch. Purchased here.

I've used Tupperware, canning jars, recycled containers of all kinds for my personal use butter. For the 'gift' versions, I do like to be consistent and professional. I purchase 4oz containers here. Please note, at Bulk Apothecary, Lids are purchased separate from the containers. Be sure to pick up both.\nUsing your spatula, put product into the bottom edge of the jar first, then fill in the middle. I tap the container on the counter to release any air bubbles that have been trapped. Keeping the jar clean, I wipe the edge clear of any spills and put on the lid.\n*Once packaged, you can store these in the fridge for 6-8 months.\nSince I live in Texas, right now, it's so wonderful to take a jar of this butter and apply right out of the fridge. It's cooling to the touch, and the texture is so silky. There's nothing better. *I do have to warn the people I give this to to keep below 75\u00ba F.--They get soft in my house, but don't turn to liquid-- As it's made of oil, it does melt in the summer sun. When transporting, I do use cooler bags to keep them solid.*\nOnce you have put your Butter in a suitable container, then ENJOY! You are finished and you will LOVE the way this feels.

So I tried to make my own, mainly made from cardboard and mortar, keeping the cost low while having an aesthetic result, and allowing for an easy replacement of the cardboard.\nThe good thing is that my cat likes it so much that she forgot about my sofa!\nThe size, shapes and finishes shown in this instructable are examples. The size can vary depending your needs (although I would not recommend to make it smaller than 60cm), the foot and cardboard pieces shapes can be anything you want, and the white finish I choose can replaced by any concrete style or color you prefer. You can even use wood instead of mortar for the foot and top, so be creative!

They will also choose a material on which they can dig their claws, and leave marks. Like a sofa.\nOn the other hand, some says cats scratch as a part of their scheme of world destruction.

I used 4kg of mortar, which is enough for my 3.5kg cat; if yours is heavier, you might want to use more.\nYour can get a lot of information in this concrete class; it gives some hints to give a custom finish to the molded parts, in case you do not like the white aspect of this DIY. We will use mortar instead of concrete, because it is easier to obtain a smooth surface using mortar (concrete contains gravels).\nYou will need a big bowl of about 24 cm side length (or diameter) as a mold (its size and shape may vary depending your taste and supplies). As you are going to pierce a hole in it (for the threaded rod), the best choice is a cheap plastic basin. I found a square one with rounded edges, which gave a nice shape to my scratching post foot.\nThe foot must contain a captive nut on which the threaded rod will be screwed on. This threaded rod is the backbone of the post, and gives its sturdiness to the cardboard tower. So once you have found the proper basin, you will have to drill a 8mm hole in its center.\nPouring the mortar in the basin with the whole rod inserted is not going to be convenient, so you will have to cut a small part of the rod (about 4cm long) as temporary guide.\nIt is better to lube this rod to help extracting it once the mortar is set (I did not lubricate it, but was nevertheless able to extract it). Screw a first nut at one of its extremity, then another one 1 cm farther. Insert this rod into the hole, so that the nuts are inside the basin, then fix the rod by adding a washer and a third nut on the other side. Make sure there is enough space to add a fourth nut on top of this last one, as these two nuts will be necessary to extract this temporary guide. It is also important for the guide to stay straight, so ensure you have some supports on which to place the basin so that the guide is not pushed away.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMU/YLD2/JI4UIF1P/FMUYLD2JI4UIF1P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK9/XZRW/JI4UIFNU/FK9XZRWJI4UIFNU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH8/1PD7/JI4UIF3H/FH81PD7JI4UIF3H.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: First Step : Preparing the Mold for the Foot"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "It is now time to mix the concrete with water. You could do this directly in the basin (like I did), just take care to not disturb the guide; using another dedicated bucket may be easier. Before manipulating mortar, keep in mind that the powder is very thin and alkaline, so it is best to protect yourself from inhaling it or covering your hands with it. Use rubber gloves, dust mask and eye protections for your safety.\nPour the water slowly, step by step, and mix thoroughly before adding more water. Again, the concrete class gives a good visual reference of what a good concrete should look like.\nOnce satisfied with the look, you will have to remove the bubbles that got trapped in the mix. This is done by vibrating the basin, the best way being the use of a sanding machine : remove the sanding paper, place the machine against the basin and move it on all sides. Do not forget the corners, they are sturdier than the walls, so as a result the bubbles are more difficult to remove.\nIf you do not have a sanding machine, you can tap on the basin using anything somewhat heavy, like a small hammer, a screwdriver handle, etc...\nYou should see bubbles popping on the top of the mortar. Keep in mind that, if you choose the same white look as my post, the last bubbles holes will be filled with wall putty, so do not worry!\nYou can now let it set. It is important to cover the basin with some plastic wrap, so that the mortar keeps its humidity, and to refrain the need to unmold the foot before about one week : mortar must set for a long time in moist conditions to be strong.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTC/4BXA/JI4UIHBF/FTC4BXAJI4UIHBF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Second Step : Pouring the Mortar for the Foot"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "I initially thought to use some wood to cover the post, but I actually tried something else to get the same style as for the foot. So I molded a kind of 'broken brick' with mortar; here is how to do the same.\nYou will need a square box about 10cm wider than the cardboard pieces, and some paper.\nThe following instructions are hard to explain, so dot hesitate to refer at the picture! Crumple the paper and put it in the box so that there is a space in the center, to act as the mold for the mortar. The paper folds will give the 'broken' look to the mortar brick. Once satisfied with the look, use some glue to fix the paper, and cover it by a plastic wrap to make it waterproof. Make sure the plastic wrap follows the folds.\nAs you did for the foot, add a piece of threaded rod in the center of the box.\nThen prepare some more mortar, and pour it into the mold. Use a small stick to ensure the mortar goes everywhere in the folds, but take care to not piercing the plastic layer. Remove the bubbles like we you did for the foot. Again, wrap the mold with plastic to contain the moisture, and let it set for one day only, because we are going to work on it while it is still not to hard.\nThe next day, unmold the brick, and extract the threaded rod. Use the drill to enlarge the hole, so that the brick can slide along the rod. Do this gently to avoid breaking the mortar. There is little chance the brick looks right at this step. The mortar not being fully set, it is still easy to grate and file it to trim it, and enhance its 'broken brick' look.\nOnce done, wrap it again and let it set for one week.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F97/P61O/JI4UKFA6/F97P61OJI4UKFA6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Third Step : Molding the Top of the Post"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Now that you have to wait for the mortar to set, lets gather cardboard.

It is up to your taste (and time actually), and I would be happy to see your creations! Some advice : use a sharp knife to get nice cuts, and prepare a pattern to quickly cut the cardboard. Having to measure and draw each shape would be a waste of time.\nOnce having a 50cm tall stack, you will have to drill a hole in the center of the cardboard pieces for the threaded rod.

Of course, you can leave the foot as is, if you prefer! If you choose to apply putty, do it step by step (do not try to fill the bubbles in one time), and sand it after each layer. It is important to use a sanding block if you want to get a clean finish.\nYou now have to extract the guide from the foot: screw one nut on the rod, and lock it in place using a second nut. These nuts should allow you to unscrew the guide from the foot. I had to gently tap mine with a hammer, but again I did not lube it. Once done, you can screw the final threaded rod, cut at 60cm long.\nI treated the top 'broken brick' as the foot : wall putty and sanding, to give the brick a smooth white finish.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2N/BOUQ/JIAJM5QW/F2NBOUQJIAJM5QW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD3/XPPK/JI4UIF4V/FD3XPPKJI4UIF4V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFU/TA05/JI4UKFA2/FFUTA05JI4UKFA2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Fifth Step : Finishing the Foot and Top"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "You now should have a foot with a threaded rod, lots of cardboard pieces and a top brick.

So I chose to twist the cardboard tower, to hide my mistakes. Luckily, I actually prefer the tower this way... Here is again your choice, straight or twisted tower! When satisfied with the result, screw the top nut a little more, so that the cardboard do not rotate to easily.\nThere is still one thing to settle : the top nut is not pretty. I personally have access to a 3D printer, so I choose to print a low poly cat, designed by xavab29, slightly modified to contain a nut. With sanding and white paint, it completes the tower.

There are two problems to solve : the first one is to to get your cat to like the post, the second one is to get your cat to stop scratching the previous scratching area.\nIn order to maximise the chances your cat uses the post, you will have to place it near the place he likes to be. Furthermore, the post must not be hidden; remember the cat is scratching to mark its territory, so the post must be seen by anyone passing by! As noted in the introduction, you should not have used materials with strong smell, as it could deter the cat from using the post. Let him take some time to get accustomed to this new thing in its living space, and do not force him to use it. It could be useful to show him the post and pet him near it. Try not to grab his pawn in order to mimic a scratching, because this will likely get him stressed, thus make him look at the post with suspicion. I read somewhere that thyme is liked by cats and tends to excite them, so I added some between the cardboards. My cat used the scratching post pretty quickly, but I can not be sure the reason was the thyme!\nThe second problem is to disaccustom your cat from his previous scratching area. Luckily, once the cat starts scratching the post, there are chances he will stop scratching nearby objects. There are some solutions if your cat continues :\nApply some perfume on the scratching area, preferably vanilla or lavander, to cover the pheromones it left before. Do not use a too strong perfume (like citrus), as it seems cats could urinate on it to cover the smell! Of course, cat repellents work as well, but do not put to much of it!\nCover the area with something that the cat will dislike; a plastic cover, a space blanket or some\ndouble adhesive tape if the area is localized, for example.\nNever ever punish your cat, he will not understand.

I hold the plant and pot with one hand and push down on the bottom of the pot with the other hand.\n\nIf you've done this successfully, the plant should come out of the pot easily! If the plant doesn't budge, you may have a rootbound plant that needs a little more massaging on the sides and bottom of the pot before it comes out.\nP.S. If it's a very large or rootbound plant, don't be afraid to cut it out of its pot, especially if it's in a thin plastic nursery pot.

I'll shake away a little excess soil or sometimes slightly loosen a root ball with my hands if the plant was rootbound, but otherwise I don't worry about them. Their roots will spread easily into new soil.\nThere are really only two times I mess with the roots of foliage plants:\nIf the plant is sick, I'll often remove as much soil as possible from the roots to check for signs of root rot and other problems.\nIf I'm dividing the plant into smaller sections, I also tend to remove as much soil as I can. This allows me to either untangle the roots of the individual sections, or find the right place to cut the root system for division.\nTo remove excess soil from plant roots, I highly recommend soaking the roots and soil in a bowl of room temperature water. (Water that is too hot or cold can hurt the plant, so be careful!) Swish the plant around lightly in the water to help the soil fall away and use your fingers to \"fluff\" the roots in the water to separate them.\n\n(Make sure not to pour the soil-y water down the drain or you'll have a clog!

I always keep a bag each of all-purpose potting soil and cactus soil on hand to use for transplanting. I'll either use one of them or mix them together depending on what I think the plant will like.\nThe pot choice is important too! To learn more about choosing the right pot type and size, read my instructable over choosing the right pot for your plant. :)\nFor example: today I'm transplanting a new aloe I purchased a couple weeks ago. (I like to give plants a little time to get used to my house before putting them through transplanting. Too much change at once can be rough on them!) I've used a four inch terra cotta pot (one inch bigger than the pot it was in), put in plastic mesh to cover the drainage hole, and filled the pot with a cactus soil mix.\n\nWhen transplanting, here are a few tips to avoid problems later:\nFill the bottom of the pot with new soil and nestle the plant into it, adding soil around the edges of the roots and pressing down lightly. Then add soil on top around the plant. Soil should be pressed into the pot so that the plant stands upright and strong.\nDon't fill a pot too full of soil! This can cause a big mess when watering. I normally stop filling no more than 1/4 inch from the top edge of the pot for small pots and 1/2 inch for large pots. The dry soil will settle slightly after it's watered the first time, and you can decide to add more soil after that.\nNever bury a plant too deeply. Burying leaves or new stem growth deeply in soil can sometimes cause rotting. This is especially important with succulents - I always try to keep them slightly above the soil.\nWater thoroughly after transplanting until water runs out the bottom of the pot. If you're transplanting a formerly rootbound plant, check back on it the next day. Sometimes the soil in and around the rootball will dry out before the soil around it, so you'll have to water right where the plant's roots are if it gets droopy.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFH/CD7O/JIAJNAAJ/FFHCD7OJIAJNAAJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Choosing the Right Pot and Soil and Transplanting the Plant"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "It's pretty normal to make a major mess while transplanting, so I always find myself doing a little cleaning up after.\nMy favorite tool for this is a small paintbrush!

They all need to be the same size but they may not be the same dimensions as the ones I have used. Unlike the 3D printed version of the planter where the module unit was a cube (all sides equal length) the three sides of my tetra briks are all different lengths so the pattern they create when laid out is not symetrical. So what I did with the pattern was to tilt the briks in such a way so that they are directly above each other. This way the weight ditribution would still be vertical. Thats all very well but it means the briks on the floor will never be in a straight line. We need to cut them to size. So with some drawing skills in TINKERCAD heres a way you can calculate the truncated base. If you would prefer to skip all this technical precision in the following 2 steps be my guest. You could always just start joining the tetra briks together and then just cut them using the edge of a table as a guide for example.

And then there were truncated spurs in geography class. How cool was that? \"Out of my way!!! Glacier coming through!\"\nAnyway, we need to find out the measurements of the tetra briks as they get cut off (.....truncated) so as to be flush with the floor. And remember these tetra briks at the base will be upside down and filled with polyurethane foam so that they won't collapse under the weight.\nStart by dragging a box out from the right onto the drawing surface and give it the same dimensions as your tetra briks. Remember when you open up the tetra brik on one end it will be slightly bigger than when its closed. We want the measurements when its open, what its going to be for the planter.\nFor demonstration purposes lets say its 10 cms. wide, 24 cms. high and 6 cms. deep. But you are going to have to work off the measurements of YOUR tetra briks.\nDuplicate the brik just once and move it half the width to the right, the full depth to the back and raise it half of its height. In my case that will be 5cms, 6cms and 12cms respectfully.Then select both bricks and duplicate\nNow move these duplicated briks as before but this tme the distance to displace is one full width, double the depth and one full height of the brik (my case: 10 cms,12 cms and 24 cms). You should have 4 bricks lined up in a funny diagonal stepping stairs.\nPHEW!.... WELL DONE..... YOUR DOING GREAT! (I'm talking to myself by the way)\nDuplicate these 4 briks and move them: one full width to the left, half the depth to the front and lift it half its height. Now you should have 8 briks that interlock nicely in a sort of Minecraft/MC Escher mode. We're just going to have to do one more duplication of all the briks and we'll have enough to calculate the truncated base.\nSo, go ahead and duplicate and now move the 8 duplicated briks two and a half widths to the right, one and a half depths to the back. It will look like the thirds picture here. Then drop it down by half its height (fourth pic). Last of all move the brik thats the furthest to the left into the gap you see between the third and fourth row: two full widths to the right, one full depth to the back and drop it down one full height.

Well, they are just a bunch of cubes after all. But now, in 3 different views or planes if you prefer we are going to turn all the briks together.\nClick on the rotating tool and turn all the briks together. By clicking and holding it down drag the curser outside the protactor wheel and you can freely choose the rotating angle. What angle you need will depend on the proportions of your tetra briks but what we want to get is that the corners of the briks of the same color are lined up. Take your time :) when its looking like you've got it where you want it (second pic) switch to LEFT view and do the same.\nBut this time all the corners will be lining up. Third pic here shows the job already done. I could of lined it up vertically but while I was rotating I brought them all down to being horizontal so that it fits better on a computer screen.\nThen change the view back to the TOP and for the final time rotate all the briks so that the corners are aligned. Fourth pic shows the job done. Now we can truncate the bottom briks\nBring out a box hole make it big enough to cover all five briks. Give it plenty of width, depth and height. Line it up with our base briks so they will all be cut in a good position. Too far up and the bottom red briks will get truncated across their top face, too far down and the yellow briks will be cut across their bottom faces. Duplicate the box hole four times and combine each brik with one of the now 5 box holes. And they are truncated! Get rid of all the other briks we don't need them. We still need to measure the lengths of the edges on the truncated bricks.\nUnfortunately, we have to go back the way we came. Back through the 3 different views and straighten out the briks again :( Then finally on the works plane we can place the ruler on the points we need and it gives us the measurements.

Its a lot easier to work in the real world with the actual tetra briks. Having said that you still need to be careful that you line them up correctly. But don't worry too much, your materials are free so if you go wrong at least you haven't wasted any hard earned cash.\nStart lining theTetra Briks up and figuring out where they will be getting glued. Mark out the lines and number them so that you don't get confused. Put the same number on the two faces that will be stuck together and you won't go wrong. Like it often happens with patterns its hard getting started but once you are on the right track its just a question of repeating the steps. I made a simple guide with a piece of paper to mark the areas for gluing. It measures half the height by half the width + half the dept. Fold it to divide the paper into the spaces you need for marking. The only other thing you need to be careful about is the positioning of the cubes at the base and remember they are upside down too.\nI use contact glue a lot. I thought it would be perfect here. You apply it to both surfaces for gluing, let it dry 20 minutes or so and then just press them together firmly and they are stuck. You have a lot of control, no slipping and sliding. But you need to be careful when sticking because it can't be unstuck too easily. So make sure you line it up well. You only get one chance. Do them in small batches. Glue the first few together, then go back and figure out the next few you're going to glue, mark them , number them, apply the glue and wait for it to dry again and stick them. And start another batch.

Use the stapler to tack the center of each side into position. Make sure you get the material tight. Work your way from the center toward the corners, keeping the material tight. Cut slits for the hooks and for the notches that go around the seat hinges. Work slowly, holding the stapler with one hand and whacking it with a mallet in the other hand. If your aim is exceptional, you don't need the mallet, but I found this worked fine. At the corners, make a few slits and staple each strip down tight before trimming off the excess. You can go around the edges later and flatten any staples that didn't go in all the way with a hammer.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTQ/Y0IU/JI4TTVJM/FTQY0IUJI4TTVJM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD9/LF79/JI4TTW1H/FD9LF79JI4TTW1H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6S/QYYC/JI4TTVI9/F6SQYYCJI4TTVI9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5X/82YV/JI4TTVYX/F5X82YVJI4TTVYX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHW/MRI7/JI4TTW2U/FHWMRI7JI4TTW2U.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Cut the Pad Material and Staple the Cover Material"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "That's it, you're done.

Then I turned the bottle while pushing it against the tool until I get a scratch all around the bottle.\nNext step is in the kitchen. You need alcohol, wool, water and ice. The principle is to have a crack developping in the glass from the scratch, due to thermal stress induced by quick temperature change. I wrapped a wool thread soaked in alcohol around the bottle, with a small knot. then I let the wool burn while turnng the bottle, and plunged the bottle in the cold water. Normally you hear and see a crack in the thickness of the bottle. You may need to repeat it until the bottle separates in two.Success is not 100% but around 85%. Something which can lead to failure (meaning not a straight cut) is if the knot abd the wool is too long, and therefore creates a hot area wider, this can lead to have the crack going out of the scratch in this area.\nAt the end of this step, you have some tops and bottoms of bottles.

I had some pieces of chalk board left over from previous projects so I just used one of those. You can either find a chalkboard from a hobby store or even use some of the chalkboard paint available from home improvement stores. If you decide to go that direction, make sure you follow the steps on the can and let the paint cure enough so you don't scratch it while handling it.\nSeeing as how there is no set size to this project, you need to get the basis of your measurements for the pallet wood from your chalkboard material itself.\nWhen cutting the boards, you want to take into account how you will be putting the chalkboard in it. I ran a groove along the sides of my boards to recess the chalkboard inside of it. Depending on your tool set ups, you can also just mount the chalkboard to the back of your pallet wood.\nIn either case, you want to be sure when you cut the pallet wood, you don't short yourself. You can always cut it again if its too long!\nI decided to run 2 vertical boards, with my two horizontal boards in between. For the vertical boards, I found the measurement of the chalkboard and then added the width of both top and bottom horizontal boards.\nFor the horizontal boards I measured the top of my chalkboard.\nI marked the distances out on my boards, deciding which piece I wanted there and then headed over to the saw.\nBe sure to have proper PPE (personal protective equipment) when cutting on the saw such as safety glasses and ear plugs. If you are not comfortable or have not been properly trained on the saw, I suggest finding someone who is that is willing to help you.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRW/TRLH/JI0JK3ND/FRWTRLHJI0JK3ND.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE0/WTMF/JI0JK3NE/FE0WTMFJI0JK3NE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Cut to Length"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Now that your boards are cut down and easier to handle, it is a lot easier to see the shape of your frame coming together.\nIf you put your piece of chalkboard on the frame, you will see that the frame is a bit too big for it. This is where I make my adjustments for how I will be holding the chalkboard.\nSince I will be putting a groove in my boards, I will want to shrink them about 1/2\" . This will allow me to put a 1/4\" groove all the way around on the inside so I can recess the chalkboard into the pallet wood.\nIf you are just going to mount your chalkboard to the back of your frame, you may want to cut your boards a little smaller to give you more \"meat\" to secure your chalkboard to.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGW/BA6J/JI0JK3NK/FGWBA6JJI0JK3NK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Size and Fit for the Chalkboard"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "If you have decided to cut the groove in your board, I find it helpful to mark the side that is to receive the groove.\nLay your frame out again and mark left, right, top and bottom. I also like to put an \"x\" on the board to be sure I am cutting the correct side.\nThen it is time to set up the saw. For this I measured the thickness of my chalkboard and used a stacked dado blade set. I made the set up just a bit thicker than that of my chalkboard so I would not have a hard time getting the chalkboard in to the pallet wood frame. I also set the blade height at around 1/4\" .\nIf you do not have a stacked dado blade set, you can use your single saw blade, just be sure you do not take out too much material. A little loose will be okay, but if the opening is too big the chalkboard may not be sturdy enough and rattle when writing on it.\nI try to take a piece of the same wood (that isn't part of my project) to do my test cut on.

I have used resin in the past, but mostly for making blanks with pens that I make. That resin needs pressure to cure to avoid bubbles and I knew that my boards would not fit so I looked for another option.\nI'm typically try to avoid resin from hobby stores as I do not know how long they have been sitting on the shelf and I didn't want to ruin my project with a bad product.\nThat's when I had found Royal Palm Resin. (available at www.royalpalmresin.com ).This is a 2 part epoxy resin which comes in 2 variations. The original and the thin. What drew me to this brand is that the thin version can be used without a pressure vessel to have it cure bubble free. There are also different sizes of each kind, so if you only have a small project you don't need to be stuck buying a gallon if you don't want it (though after using Royal Palm Resin I am going to start finding reasons to use it more). I had contacted the owner of the company on his facebook page and he was super quick and helpful with answering any questions I had (that's also a bonus to me - I usually have lots of questions and what better way to get the answers than from the person most directly associated with the product!)\nAnother bonus of this resin is that there is virtually NO odor at all. You could mix and pour this in your kitchen if you needed to ( I don't suggest this as it can be a bit messy but you get the point!)\nWhen I got my resin it included detailed instructions on how to mix and use it properly which was great.\nI followed them easy enough and got to mixing (make sure to wear some disposable gloves!)\nI made way more than I had needed but I would rather have that had happen than to not have enough. Luckily I anticipated this and had one of my pen blank molds ready to use in case!\nMake sure to properly mix the resin, getting rid of the \"streaks\" that you can see when they first get poured. When the streaks are gone, and looks perfectly clear, it is properly mixed.\nFor my project I wanted the resin to have a color, so I used a bit of a copper mica powder. These are available at craft stores or other online suppliers.\nOnce that was mixed in, I used to heat gun as suggested to warm the resin (making it more fluid and easier to pour, along with aiding in getting rid of some bubbles)\nOnce the proper consistency was reached it was time to pour!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTC/AQ0A/JI0JK3QM/FTCAQ0AJI0JK3QM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGV/ZBPQ/JI0JK3QQ/FGVZBPQJI0JK3QQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAK/67BA/JI0JK3RJ/FAK67BAJI0JK3RJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKF/CFVS/JI0JK3RM/FKFCFVSJI0JK3RM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2P/RE06/JI0JK3SD/F2PRE06JI0JK3SD.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Mixing the Resin"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "Start filling your voids with the resin.\nAs you can see I'm not exactly the neatest which is why i put the painters tape down!\nThis is also when I had my major fail moment.

Coincidentally, the owner of Royal Palm Resin had contacted me to see how I was doing with my project! Talk about customer service! After some discussion with me, he said that there would be no problems adding another pour of his resin on top of what I had already done, it just needed to be clean of any debris or dirt.\nRenewed in the ability of being able to fix the mess I had created, I went back to my project after 48 hours (allowing for a proper cure). I looked at the backside of the frame and saw that most of my holes had been covered with the cured resin. I took a hot glue gun and filled a few of the pinholes that were left and then made another batch of resin.\nThis time was a success!

Occasionally I would wipe the surface down with denatured alcohol to help remove excess dust from sanding.\nFor the base of the message board, I wanted to keep the rustic look going, so i just used my belt sander to wear down a groove on the board for a piece of chalk.

Succulents and cacti like to be watered like your typical houseplant: deeply and until runoff is achieved.\nThe main difference here is that succulents and cacti like to go much longer in between waterings. A good way to think about this is to consider how they live in their natural environments. Succulents and cacti thrive in rocky, sandy, and dry areas with very little rainfall, so they're used to getting one big drink every once in a while.\nWhile I may water a pothos once a week, a succulent in a comparable size pot may only be watered every 2-3 weeks. However, I also have many tiny succulents in little pots on my windowsills. If the temperature is high and the sun is intense, I can sometimes even water them more than once a week.\nIn winter, you'll want to water even less often. Many cacti and succulents go dormant during the winter due to colder temperatures and shorter days. Even though they're inside, I water mine less.\nIn general good watering for succulents and cacti come down to one major rule: never, ever water until the soil is completely dry.

The inner workings had become badly corroded over the years and there were signs of battery acid leakage.\nThe other main ingredients for this light are an old Ikea 12v wall spot light and a heavy cast desktop microphone stand.

Luckily the paint flaked off really easily as I really didn\u2019t want to scrape it off and risk marking the metal which would mean more cleaning and polishing at a later stage. I rinsed the paint stripper and finished the base with a Scotchbrite pad.\n\nI also stripped out the innards from the bike light which was the battery holder, the bulb and backplate and the switch mechanism. I\u2019d considered re-using the switch but decided it would be too hard as well as a little less practical than a switch part way down the flex, which has the benefit of not having to touch/move the light in order to turn it on and off. I did glue the old switch button back to light casing though.\n\nNext, I freed the MR16 fitting from the Ikea spot light.

I just needed to reduce the diameter at the open end using a bench grinder and a file. It was made of aluminium so this was a fairly quick process.\nMy biggest quandary was deciding how I was going to join the lamp to the stand. I considered a number of options including sliding a metal bar into the mic holder and attaching the lamp to the metal bar. I thought that this would make the lamp too high in the stand as well as look cumbersome and overly complicated. As I had a spare mic stand I thought it was worth seeing if I could manipulate the holder with heat to make it fit the diameter of the lamp. Success, this was a fairly slow process as I didn\u2019t want to risk breaking it or losing the desired shape. You can see how much I was able to manipulate it by comparing it to the spare one I have.\nI felt it needed a bit more to the design of the way the holder attached to the light as well as be more robust, after all this is intended to be a working desk light. I often find that I make use of old bike accessories and components in builds like this (as I did in the petrol tank speaker I made a few years ago), I manage to find this semi-circular fitment that I believe was once part of a chain ring bash guard. The shape was just about the same as the lamp body. I cut this in half and attached a half to each side of the now widened mic holder. I used hex bolts and nylock nuts to attach it to the lamp body. I also added the small pointy ended set screws to the clamp just to add to the industrial look of the lamp.\nI found a suitable (if a little big) rubber grommet that the cable could pass through.

Its not eating.\nAs noted in step 7 the toys kept getting caught on the bottom of the unit and on the polycarbonate sheet that was added to correct the problem. So I would say that even though the concept was neat and the 'monster' looked cute - it did not work well... really, not at all. :-(\nSome lessons learned:\n1. It appears that the sponges need to be longer or more flexible so that if on first contact the toy does not go in the 'sponge' or new flap thingie will flip over it and not jam it into the bottom of the unit. Presently the sponges will pin the toy against the bottom plate or polycarbonate sheet and stop the tongue from spinning.\n2. The drive train needs to be more robust, or at least fine tuned so that is runs smoothly. 3D printed gears work, but may hang occasionally - sometimes here too. They run well, but every so often they hang. That may have to do with how well the wheels are running true on the axial. The wheel mounting is OK, but could be better. If I thought that the 'monster' was going to get excessive use I would probably explore real bearings.\n3. I had fun designing and printing the 'sponge holders'. I got more experience with Fusion 360 and 3D printing in general. They turned out well and did exactly what I intended.\n4. PVC sheet material is nice to work with. I found it at Home Depot for $15 for a 2' x 4' sheet of 1/4\" thick. It allows use of woodworking tools and it glues fast with PVC cement and does not need to be painted. I'll have to use it in some future projects.\n5. Nonslip drawer liners work well on 3D printed wheels. This combination worked surprisingly well. The wheels did not slip on hard floors or carpet. There were easy to put together too.\nSo the concept is nice but probably needs some additional experimentation and redesign to get it functioning correctly. I still had fun making this instructable and learned a few things!

Turn the handle inside out and sew an 1/8\" topstitch around the entire piece. This is the process used on the blue striped binder.\nHowever, for the cherry binder, I loved the fabrics so much and didn't want to waste it, so I bound the tiny strips! The outcome was just darling. To do this, cut two (2) 14\" sections from the ~1.5\" leftover strip. Lay your quilted 14\" strip right side up. Take a 2\" binding strip and fold in half long ways.

The largest ball will be for the base, the main part of the pot. Then there will be a ball, probably about half the size: this will form the arms.

A couple of ways I found to avoid these problems: If it feels as though the clay is getting too warm, place it in the freezer for a few minutes before continuing work. I used this trick a lot to get through this part. Also, if the clay seems too thin, you can either add more of the color, or ball it up and try again. I added more clay at least once, and started over again no less than four times!\nSo to start the body, I took the largest ball, and flattened it out into a circle.\nNext, bringing up the sides--the hardest part in my opinion.\nFirst, I took the edges of the circle a little ways apart, and then smooshed them together. This I repeated over and over again, all the way around, until I had some semblance of a pot.\nThen, to make the sides taller, I placed thumb and forefinger on the inside and outside of the pot, and gently rubbed them together, continuously pulling up.\nI repeated the above steps over and over, until I ended up with a tiny, finished pot that fit my little air plant as hair. I did make the edges at the top close in a few millimeters, and the body have curved edges, but this was to exaggerate the chubby little monster body.\nIn order to smooth out the fingerprints and the nicks, gently and quickly brush the pad of your finger against the surface of the clay until it has the smooth, finished look.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3H/049Q/JHKU1R5G/F3H049QJHKU1R5G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD8/QTGM/JHKU1R5E/FD8QTGMJHKU1R5E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP6/AS2T/JHKU1RO3/FP6AS2TJHKU1RO3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSE/LBII/JHKU1R63/FSELBIIJHKU1R63.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSS/AJD9/JHKU1RNV/FSSAJD9JHKU1RNV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9U/MKLM/JHKU1RNE/F9UMKLMJHKU1RNE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCV/D9VJ/JHKU1RM7/FCVD9VJJHKU1RM7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO5/ATJF/JHKU1RLS/FO5ATJFJHKU1RLS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJD/2DIU/JHKU1RLH/FJD2DIUJHKU1RLH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVP/RH51/JHKU1RLG/FVPRH51JHKU1RLG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Making the Body"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "My little guy really started to come alive here!\nOk, so remember the three balls of clay from the beginning?

I curved it slightly, so it resembles a kidney bean with half flattened. I repeated above for the other arm.\nThis next part is very important! If the arms are not joined well, they will fall off (and probably break) while cooking or air drying.\nTo join the arms to the monster, I first picked which side of him I wanted to be his face. I loosely pressed the flat part of both arms to opposite sides of his head, to make sure I liked how he looked before permanently attaching them. Next, firmly supporting my monster from inside his head, I smoothed and blended the flat part of his arms until they were seamed with his head, leaving the more rounded part unblended--while still attached.

Phew!\nThen, I rolled each ball until they were about the size and shape as a tic-tac, which turned out perfectly for my little monster.\nAttaching the feet was a lot easier than the arms, though. I firmly pressed the two little tic-tac balls of clay, horizontally, onto the monster. This gave his little feet a rounded shape, like a chubby little baby's feet.\nTo further attach the feet, I blended some of the 'heel' into the bottom of the monster pot, where the blending would not be seen.\nIf you like him just like this, without a face or toe pads, skip to step 8.

Then, roll it out into a very thin string/rope, a 'snake' as we call them in my house. ;) It will be about as thin as a toothpick, maybe smaller (depending on how you roll it).\nUsing a toothpick, cut off a miniature little section of the clay.

Roll it into a tiny ball, and flatten it against the table for a miniature toe pad. This you can leave on the table until all parts are completed. Make two more of these pads for his other toes.\nThen, for the larger foot pad, cut off a section of clay (still from the same 'snake'). For the proper proportions, make this length between two and three times as long as the ones for the toes, again flattening it after making a ball.\nFinally, to attach these pads to his feet, press the three smaller and one bigger firmly onto the foot, in the classic arrangement--the big one in the middle, the three smaller arrayed near the top of the big pad.

Otherwise, skip to the next step. Either way, I'm sure, will be absolutely adorable!\nUnfortunately, I don't have very many pictures of this step. You use a lot of the same techniques as from the last step, so it will be very simple. The most important part of making 2D clay objects, especially from balls of clay, is to remember that the area will increase dramatically as it is being flattened onto the monster.\nFor the eyes: Using the same length of clay from before, cut about half a centimeter of clay and roll it into a ball. Flatten it out--this is one eye. Repeat the process for the other eye. If my instructions leave eyes that are too big or too small for your monster, it is as simple as adding or removing clay, and re-rolling the eye balls (hee-hee!) (...sorry) and re-flattening them.\nFor the mouth: Cut a section from the clay length--but don't roll it up into a ball! Instead, roll it around until the ends are flat, not pointed, and it is as long and thin as you want.\nFor the tooth: Optional, but I think it just makes him look cuter ;) I cut a tiny section of white clay, rolled it out into a 'snake' with pointed ends. I cut off one of these pointed ends, and when I flattened it on the table, it turned into a crooked little triangle, perfect for a snaggle tooth on a (baby) monster.\nAttaching: In order to avoid obvious seams, before putting all of the face on the monster, I put the tooth on the back of the mouth. Then, I pressed the eyes onto the monster. They seem really far apart at first, until you add the mouth. The exact structure is above in the picture, but I positioned the mouth almost between the eyes--hence why they were so far apart.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ6/0BMS/JHKU1RH6/FZ60BMSJHKU1RH6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMH/QLK9/JHKU1RG4/FMHQLK9JHKU1RG4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F81/QSR3/JHKU1RCZ/F81QSR3JHKU1RCZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8A/NY25/JHKU1RDN/F8ANY25JHKU1RDN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Making the Face"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Here's where the real difference between bake and air-dry clay comes in.

With the particular type of baking clay I used, it took less than 15 minutes.\nThis step though, is really easy. All that you have to do is follow the instructions on the package of clay. For me, it said to bake the clay at 275' for 15 minutes per 1/4 in of clay.

This instructable, as usual, was born from researching something completely off topic. I think this happens to most of us when we fire up our google membership cards, one link leads to another; and the next thing you know we find ourselves watching drone reviews or kitten video's at 3 in the morning. But I digress, this idea was born from looking up the ratio for making a natural herbicide from salt, vinegar and dish soap. It had a link talking about edibles harvested from your backyard, (and no, not those kind of edibles...) This bounced me around till I found a site talking about dandelion syrup and all things dandelion.\nTurns out, dandelions have numerous benefits, they can be turned into salads, made into wine, heck the heads can be dipped in panko and fried up with some marinara - Yum! There are numerous health benefits as well, ranging from calcium substitutes to liver treatments, but the most important are those that affect the heart. After a long cold winter, dandelions are some of the first flowers to break up the greys left over from winter and the first to melt you frozen heart. (Yes, I have watched Frozen too many times with my little one...)\nSome dandelion fun facts? each flower head is actually hundreds of little flowers called florets. And dandelions are one of the most vital early spring nectar sources for a wide host of pollinators, aka the bees; so pretty important. Did you know, dandelions used to be referred to as the first flowers of love. After all, how many parents have received a bouquet of dandelions from a child looking up at them with delight. How many flower crowns have been made, how many have been given in a impromptu give of love, I'd say quite a few.\nOne thing I found was how many sites say you can't keep dandelions in a vase, they wilt up too fast. Really though, just like any delicate flower they just need the right care at harvest. Dandelions need to be cleanly cut rather then pulled as this action crushes the stem, impeding uptake of water. Additionally they need to be placed in water ASAP! Also, once picked, the stem begins to lose strength. That's why placing them in a test tube works so well, the head rests on the rim of the tube. Now there are many test tube type vases out there, but I wanted something that with a little juxtaposition; test tubes combined with raw wood allow this vase to meld with most decor. From ultra modern to vintage it just works. The Yellow of the dandelion pairs perfectly with the glass and blonde wood, though it works well with other flowers as well.

If you\u2019re a fan of keeping things clean, creative reuse, or both, I hope this Instructable helps you out! These methods are my go-to tricks for removing labels and price stickers and clearing up residue they often leave. I frequently use them on glassware like jars from groceries, but they certainly extend to many other situations \u2013 for example, the first time I used mayonnaise to remove residue was on a bow saw. That trick is my favorite and has worked for me just the same on electronics\u2019 plastic housing as it worked on glass jars, as we\u2019ll soon see. Read on to hear more of how mayonnaise has worked for me. I\u2019ll also include a little science for tho se of you who\u2019d like to know more about how things work.\nSince I most frequently use this on glass jars and bottles, I\u2019ll start with a summary of ideas. Here\u2019s a brief summary of the tricks so you know what\u2019s to come after that:\nMayonnaise (and possibly other emulsions)\nSoaking\nHeat\nSolvents\nAbrasion (i.e. scrubbing)\nFinally, I\u2019ll present two case studies that I\u2019ve done since the inception of writing\nThe real power of these isn\u2019t in the individual methods, but how they can be combined for maximum efficacy, so there will certainly be connections and overlap between these steps!", "title": "The Complete Guide to Label Removal", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Complete-Guide-to-Label-Removal/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Label/sticker removal from new purchases is both the first and foremost application and the most straightforward. After all, when you buy something new and shiny, wouldn\u2019t you rather it be new and shiny everywhere, not new and shiny except for that spot where the label used to be?\nThe other main application I\u2019ve found is in repurposing containers once you\u2019ve emptied them of their original contents, and that\u2019s not just one idea but a whole spectrum of them for which Instructables is the perfect place to explore. Since I like a good solid glass jar, I often save the ones I like for holding things I\u2019ve prepared like hot sauce or salad dressing, or bulk buys that could use a handier container than the large plastic bags I first bought them in.\nFeeling more creative or artistic? Try a glass bottle cutter Instructable, make your own frosted glass, grow a plant, make blue-filtering glasses, build an automatic pet feeder\u2026 the possibilities are nigh endless!", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Why Would These Tricks Help You?"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Mayonnaise has practically been a silver bullet for me \u2013 it almost always does the trick with one or sometimes two applications and little extra effort. The idea is simple \u2013 get as much of the label off as you can, spread a thin layer of mayonnaise across it, wait a while, and then rub the residue off and wash off any mayonnaise that may still be left.\nThe first step is just to get off what you can before putting the mayonnaise to the task. This is because just as with any other method it takes more work to remove a thick layer than a thin one, and the outer layer of paper labels is typically something you can tear most of the way off by hand before bringing in the bigger guns. If the subject of your cleaning can be immersed in water, that\u2019s a good way to loosen up paper labels; if not, try heat from a hair dryer. We\u2019ll return to both of those after more on this method.\nOnce you\u2019ve got most of the label itself off and are down to the residue, spread a layer of mayonnaise over the residue. Then, just wait! I don\u2019t actually know how long you need to wait \u2013 I typically apply it and then either have to leave, need to go to sleep, or just forget about it, so a few hours is definitely enough. It changes from opaque to translucent after a while, and I figure by the time it\u2019s made such a phase transition, it\u2019s probably ready to be scrubbed off.\nFor the removal, I just use a paper towel and scrub. I\u2019m not sure whether or not scrubbing with the part of the paper towel that has the mayonnaise on it matters, but that\u2019s what I usually do since it\u2019s the part that I was already scrubbing with anyway. Usually just one go is enough for me, but if at some point you notice that no more residue is being removed after several good scrubs, simply apply a little more mayonnaise and repeat the process.\nI haven\u2019t tried other emulsions yet since (1) mayonnaise has worked so well for me so far and (2) it\u2019s cheaper and less likely to be eaten by me than the other candidates I have on hand, but I\u2019d like to experiment with others \u2013 possibly in a future Instructable! I\u2019m not actually sure what it is about mayonnaise that works so well, but experimentation could help me zero in on it. The oil and the vinegar are candidates for an explanation; mayonnaise is a convenient vessel simply because it\u2019s a gel not a liquid and hence won\u2019t run off. It could also have something to do with emulsification, which in a nutshell is the mixing of polar molecules like water or vinegar and nonpolar molecules like the triglycerides of culinary oils to mix. This can be done, for example, with amphiphilic (Greek for \u201cboth-loving\u201d) molecules that have both a polar end and a nonpolar end, which is what the lecithin does in mayonnaise. (It\u2019s in egg yolks or alternatively is commonly extracted from soy.) These amphiphilic molecules form bubbles with either polar outside and nonpolar inside or vice versa, et viola, an emulsion. As anyone who uses natural peanut butter without any additives knows, if not refrigerated some peanut oil can separate from the rest of the butter. Peanut butter is another example of an emulsion. Whether it\u2019s the emulsifier, the vinegar, or the oil that disrupts adhesion is something I\u2019m not yet able to say.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2K/5MNH/JHAU2571/F2K5MNHJHAU2571.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Mayonnaise (and Possibly Certain Other Condiments Like It)"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Simply being soaked in water is enough to weaken or loosen some adhesives and labels. Even if a soak doesn\u2019t do the trick alone, it can be a good way to break down the fibers of paper-based labels, making them easy to remove in preparation for mayonnaise application. Any temperature of water helps, but if you use hot water (and it either soaks in quickly enough or stays hot long enough) you can get double the bang for your buck because heat is the next in our list of plans of attack.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPA/03D8/JHATZS5U/FPA03D8JHATZS5U.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Soaking"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Most things destabilize under enough heat \u2013 solids melt into liquids as the chemical bonds holding them together are broken, fuels burn as their molecular bonds are broken and oxygen reacts with the freed atoms, and so on. It\u2019s similar for us, but our label adhesive bonds are generally much weaker and can be overcome with much less heat such as from a hair dryer. That said, even these temperatures can still be too hot to be in comfortable direct or prolonged contact with, so be careful! It can be hard to peel off labels simultaneously with heating them for this reason, so aim carefully or try using some sort of tong or hand covering. So far I\u2019ve been able to get by with just careful aiming and hand placement.\nBe sure to peel quickly before your subject cools back down, or you\u2019ll most likely be back where you started as the adhesive reattaches itself. Adhesives often work through weak interactions known as van der Waals interactions which tend to be reformed as easily as they\u2019re broken because all the interactions involved are relatively weak. By contrast, stronger chemical bonds typically require breakdown and rearrangement of molecules or parts of molecules, which requires more energy in either direction the reaction is taken \u2013 as an example, gasoline doesn\u2019t spontaneously burst into flame but requires a spark or flame to get started, even though the overall reaction gives us a net energy output that we use to drive our vehicles. Breaking carbon dioxide and water apart to form the hydrocarbons that make up gasoline is of course an even more uphill challenge, of course.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWR/MW6Z/JHAU1HA8/FWRMW6ZJHAU1HA8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FME/V466/JHATZT3W/FMEV466JHATZT3W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZL/6X4O/JHATZTD3/FZL6X4OJHATZTD3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Heat"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Though it was mentioned earlier separately under the heading \u201cSoaking\u201d, water is in fact a solvent too \u2013 it\u2019s just a very mild and weak one. Typically, for me, using solvents means using acetone, which is easy to find in paint thinners and nail polish removers. This is something I don\u2019t like to use unless I have to, though, because I don\u2019t want to breathe the fumes and always wear my respirator when I do. (That\u2019s more than is generally necessary, but I really like to be on the safe side.) Sometimes, alcohol can succeed as a middle ground choice, stronger than water but weaker than acetone. In any case, solvents are best used in conjunction with scrubbing, with a simple paper tower at first or with something more abrasive if that doesn\u2019t cut it. What we really want is simply to weaken it so it can be scrubbed away without much trouble; after all, it would take a very powerful solvent, a long time, or both to dissolve the adhesive completely.\nAs the name suggests, solvents work by dissolving things, in our case glues and adhesives. To describe it briefly, the interactions between molecules of the solvent and molecules of the solute (which is the thing we\u2019re trying to dissolve, in this case residue) are stronger than the interactions solute molecules have with one another, making it easier for the solute molecules to dissolve into the solvent than to stay with the rest of the solute. Often this means that solvents are composed of either very polar or very nonpolar molecules, depending on whether you\u2019re trying to dissolve something that is polar or nonpolar, respectively. Acetone is very much in the polar category, as are alcohol and water.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FI8/1OM0/JHATZTMA/FI81OM0JHATZTMA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Solvents"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Finally, we come to abrasion, which really just means any sort of scrubbing. What you use here depends on what you\u2019re working on, as you don\u2019t want to scrub so hard that you damage the actual thing you\u2019re trying to clean! Towels, as I\u2019ve cited before, are the always-safe choice if you don\u2019t need to get into serious scrubbing. If you do, however, you can try kitchen scouring pads, melamine foam (which you may know as magic erasers), or steel wool. The choice is an important one \u2013 one of my rules or maxims is BFAW: Brute Force Always Works\u2026 but not always the way you want it to! That caveat of course points to the fact that if you\u2019re too harsh you risk damaging that which you mean to clean.\nThe only two times I can think of mayonnaise not doing the trick were times that I resorted to abrasion with great success. The first time, I used a combination of mopping with acetone and scrubbing with steel wool to clean outstandingly tough glue off of a glass jar. Steel wool is serious business; glass is the only thing I\u2019ve worked with tough enough to stand up to steel wool without collateral damage. The other time was on my coffee table when part of a magazine somehow became affixed to it. A melamine foam eraser made relatively quick work of it but wore away the finish where I scrubbed.

In colder and drier climates, chances are that you will need to help your house plants out with a little added humidity.

In my experience, no matter how much care and turning and rinsing you provide a humidifier filter, it WILL mold on you and and smell is enough to make me never buy a filtered humidifier in the long run. Plus, recurring filter costs drive up the price.\nMake Sure the Humidifier is the Right Size. Humidifiers are typically categorized by the size of the room they'll be used in, so be sure to double check! It would be useless to buy a desk humidifier and assume it would work in a 300 square foot room.\nEnsure the Humidifier Can Be Easily Cleaned. Shop around for a humidifier without a ton of extra pieces with little nooks and crannies. The trickiest part of cleaning a humidifier can be removing all the scale buildup from the water, so try to go easy on yourself!\nCheck the Noise and Light. If the humidifier will be in a common area or a bedroom, you'll probably want to be able to sit and relax without a constant PPPPPPPPPSSSSSSSSSSSSEEHEHHH sound going on. ;) Many humidifiers also include lights that can not be turned off, but you can also use some black tape to cover it!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5F/C2ER/JHATOORV/F5FC2ERJHATOORV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Obvious Answer: Buy a Humidifier"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Another favorite way to increase humidity in a small area is to create a pebble tray.\nA pebble tray is just what it sounds like: a shallow tray lined with pebbles that a plant pot can set on.

Water is poured over the pebbles until it reaches JUST below the bottom of the pot.\n\nYou don't want the pot in the water, but right on top of it. Placing the pot directly into the water can cause the plant to accept too much water and get sick.\nThe only downside to pebbles trays: you will need to clean them, and often.

Our Isa Browns and California White varieties (like most) are extremely hardy birds. Throughout the winter I would take their temperature by touching their feet. I figured that a cold foot was a sign that the birds were in bad shape.\nThe easiest way to heat the coop is with a light bulb. The birds will sleep fine. The bulb wattage also let's you easily adjust the amount of heat for different coops/temps. I found I heated only when temps dropped below 15deg F or -10deg C\nCoop Design - We built an A-Frame coop and insulated it for winter. See more on Coop Design from one of my first instructables. I built this first A-Frame coop while living in New Orleans. I found it easy to modify mainly with plastic sheathing. No rigid insulation except at the top of the coop. I used a series of hanging plastic strips 3\" thick at the door. Similar principle to the way commercial freezes us heavy hanging plastic.\nHeating - The photo shows my homemade heater... obviously a DIYer. I took an exterior light fixture and added a coffee tin. The tin provided a place to hide electrically connections from the birds. It also served to radiate heat. Typically I used a 40 watt bulb. When temps dropped below zero F or -16 C I switched to a 70 watt. As discussed under the laying section. I found it easy to keep the light on a timer designed for Christmas lights. I just bungee'd it in place along the fence.\nEasier still... you could always opt for buying on a chicken heater and adding a thermostat.

We found it easier to supplement the ladies with scraps from the house.\nSome may find this objectionable but we fed our ladies meat... all kinds of meat. We don't want to give the meat scraps in the coop and during the summer flies will quickly descend on anything left out. They will eat everything from skin (pure fat) to the bone marrow (protein and minerals) to bone itself (calcium).\nAn easier option is to buy any of the treats popular online... see here. Most common on forums are the meal worms.\n2. Diversion- It's important to keep the ladies active. If they are simply sitting around in the coop waiting for the end of winter they will start bullying. There is a natural pecking order but the lower birds tend to get more abuse when the top hens are bored (maybe you've seen this before...) It played out for me most when the chickens were eating. See the design I used for my auto feeder. A piece of PVC is so easy.\n3. Exercise suffered a bit but we made sure to let the ladies out each day. We rigged up a pulley to the door of the coop.

For that, I apply double sided tape on one side so that my workpiece can be easily hold down to the bed so that I can machine onto it. Then I marked the centre location so I may know the zero coordinates. Once the workpiece has been Mount on to the CNC I first start machining that text. For the text I choose engraving V bit. I choose those engraving bits because they have capability to do the detail work. The flat depth has been kept is 4 mm. For the font, I choose alien fonts to match the complete build with my theme. Once the text has been machined I move on to the next step in which I am profiling the base of the stand. The design I choose is similar to the Alienware CPU cases. In the middle of the base, I slightly change the design and made two boundaries in which resin has been filled. The plan was that when light lightens up that portion starts glowing. Since it is a CNC project that's why there is not a ton of work to do in the main part of the build. Once the basic shape of the base has been cut out I cut same design on a piece of acrylic which I sandwiched in between those two wooden pieces. In top two layers I cut 2 inch diameter hole so that I can fix the neck into my base. Then I move on to the cutting of headpieces for the stand. The shape is quite similar to the Alienware logo. Once I cut down all the pieces for my stand I start machining onto the back side of the pieces in which I am going to install the LED. For that I made a jig so that I can hold my job and then machine backside of those portion where I am going to install the LED strip so that they will not create any problem during the installation. I insert my pieces into the jig and to make them rigid during the machining process glued up them with hot glue. I also make sure not to machine too much wide area because I have to drill holes for joining all parts together to make a solid stand. I also machine an area equal to the dimension of my controller beneath the previous machined area for the led strip so that I can also embed this inside my stand to make the build cleaner.", "step_imgs": ["https://www.instructables.com/files/deriv/F1Z/U4Q2/JH0TQK8Y/F1ZU4Q2JH0TQK8Y.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC0/S9PZ/JH0TQK8S/FC0S9PZJH0TQK8S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4T/UD6Y/JH0TQK8V/F4TUD6YJH0TQK8V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWV/NOIA/JH0TQK8W/FWVNOIAJH0TQK8W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSD/3LP7/JH0TQKAL/FSD3LP7JH0TQKAL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY0/LVMZ/JH0TQK9Y/FY0LVMZJH0TQK9Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHP/SV3Y/JH0TQKAK/FHPSV3YJH0TQKAK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0E/L3J0/JH0TQKEA/F0EL3J0JH0TQKEA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDS/L6R8/JH0TQKEZ/FDSL6R8JH0TQKEZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMF/QWA3/JH0TQKUS/FMFQWA3JH0TQKUS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD9/187J/JH0TQKU0/FD9187JJH0TQKU0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHJ/J0G3/JH0TQKV0/FHJJ0G3JH0TQKV0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAC/UNJM/JH0TQKUT/FACUNJMJH0TQKUT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRB/BYFG/JH0TQKUU/FRBBYFGJH0TQKUU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Machining the Stand."}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Once all the parts have been cut down I cut the tabs and remove excess material.

Since I am using a hole saw that's why the parts are not going to separate from each other that's why to separate them apart I use my CNC and Jigsaw so that I can install the neck into the stand. For the neck, I am using 2 inch diameter acrylic rod. Since the rod is too long that's why I need to trim it down and for that, I used my mitre saw with a lot of water to ease the cutting process and cut down the rod up to 3 inches long. Then I mark the centre onto the rod and centre punch and drill 10 mm diameter hole so that I can feed the wire. Since I am using extrude acrylic for my project that's why I use plenty of water to keep the material cool during the cutting and drilling process. It's good to use Cast acrylic for these kinds of work. Since the middle hole is used for fastening the neck that's why I made two tapered holes meeting the main hole so that I can feed the wire from the base to the headpieces.\nFor the connection of head and neck piece I use 10 mm diameter thread rod piece. I clean the acrylic pieces and make them flat so that neck will lie on to it completely flush. Then I feed the wire through the holes.

The only major size requirement is that they should be at least as high as your tire, i.e. if you place them on the ground next to your bike's wheel the top should be where the spokes are. I recommend you read through this Instructable before you chose your pieces because there are some more things that need to match size-wise, like the length of the pipes compared to the wood.\none long piece of wood - to bring the business end closer to you. Can be as long as you want, although I recommend somewhere between 30 cm to 50 cm or 12\" to 20\".\naluminium pipe - this will hold the tire in place. I originally used steel rods from old printer cartridges, but the aluminium works just as well, is easier to get and a lot easier to machine. The length you need it equal to the width of your bike tire plus twice the width of the wood pieces you are using for this holder. A little more cannot hurt, since you can always trim it later.\nplastic pipe - This pipe needs to be roughly as long as the aluminium piece, and wide enough that said rod can move through it without interference while leaving room for a piece of string. Err on the side of a little more room!\neyelets (different sizes, read on) - You need two eyelets that the plastic pipe fits into, one eyelet that the rod fits into comfortably (you can use three larger ones, or widen two smaller ones like I did). Then you also need three more for the string to fit through. Large ones will do the trick, but smaller ones are recommended.\nstring - some sturdy string or twine that will move the rod back and forth. It will see some friction so make sure to use something smooth, but it does not need to be too heavy since there will be little load on it.\n2 handholds - Something to weigh the ends of the string down and make them easy to grab. I used corks in the first design and large washers in the second one.\nscrews - to screw things together. Make sure they are long enough to use on the t-portion, where they need to go through one slat into another.\nThe Tools I used\nsaws (optional) - just in case you do not have scrap pieces of the required size.

A lot of this project is comprised of happy accidents and educated guesses, so do not be afraid of experimenting. I used a vice to open up the eyelets I had. The way I did it was putting the top end in the vice and use pliers to bend it open. Then I inserted the pipe and used the same pliers to bend the end back into a roundish shape.\nNow, the two pipe-fitted eyelets need to go on the T-shape, one at the end of the \"leg\" and one centered at the \"top\" relative to the letter. On the actual holder that is more like far left and far right on the T. You probably should pre-drill those holes with a smaller bit.

I recommend using a countersink bit for the outside of the holes and on the ends, and some sandpapers for any outward edges.

I would recommend the second one since it is a lot easier, but who am I to spare you whatever thinking went into the first one? I made a knot at the center of the string, a simple overhand knot, and then another, and a couple more, until I had a knot larger than the through-hole in the aluminum rod.\nLooking back, the second method is actually the more intuitive one.

The important thing is that the rod should behave just as it would when you want it to hold your bike.\nNow, keeping your gaze firmly focused on the single piece of wood, let the rod slide out. Not too slowly, but not tearing-at-the-rope fast either. Make a mental note of where the rod lands relative to the wood. Actually, on top of the mental note mark the center point of the rod as it slides out on the piece.\nImportant: depending on how much play the aluminum pipe has in the plastic, it will sag a bit after performing its sliding action. Which is why you need to make sure that the eyelet is placed where the rod lands at first, not where it ends up as it comes to rest.

A pet or favorite animal is a great choice but don't limit yourself, there are lots of other subjects that will work just as well. That said, a distinct outline and a decent amount of color variance will produce the best results.\nWith your image in hand you'll want to start by removing the background. Special apps, like Background Eraser, and high end software will make quick work of this but getting stuck in with the erase tool in Paint is also a viable option. When the background is gone you can begin dividing up your subject.\nStart by tracing the outline with straight lines. Next, if your subject has distinct color sections trace those, otherwise use the vertices of the outline as starting points and begin drawing triangles. Be conscious of your mesh size as too small of triangles will cause your piece count to soars, along with your workload. On the other hand, go too big and you lose too much fidelity, making it harder to interpret the final image. You can see in the animation below how my initial mesh (green) was very tight and I ended up redoing it to it's final, 109 piece, size (yellow).\nNow that you have a mesh it's time to choose your colors. While I could have gone with a couple more shades of grey to get an even closer match I instead decided to really push the image's high contrast, one of the reasons I chose our dog as a subject in the first place, by only using three main colors. How much time you want to spend mixing paint and how you want to paint (by-hand, spray, etc) should all be considered when choosing colors. The picking itself can be done manually with the software's color wheel or by using a built-in or plug-in \"Average Color\" tool for each segment.\nFinally you need to print your template. You will need at least two copies, one for cutting and one for assembly/reference, but unless you have a large format printer or a small image you will probably need more.

I suggest finding a way to listen to a podcast or put a show you've been meaning to binge on in the background because sanding all of the pieces is this projects most time consuming yet monotonous task. You'll need to clean up the front face and all three edges first and then round off the top edges and all three corners to give the pieces a more polished, even look.\nWhen the sanding is done you'll want to clean the pieces of any leftover dust before moving on to priming/painting. If you're using spray paints chances are you'll run into this little paradox: The force of the spray is enough to blow smaller pieces around but once the paint dries, even a little, it can stick to the base and when you go to remove them it can peel and damage your finish. I tired painting on an old silicon mat for a few of the smaller pieces but only had limited success. My best advice is to just be patient, spary small pieces from a distance, using more passes to get full coverage. Also if you prime and paint each batch successively the dried primer will typically hold the pieces in place a little better than friction alone while you paint. Just be gentle when removing pieces or the afore mentioned peeling could ruin your day.\nOne extra step I had to take was spraying the acrylic painted nose and eye pieces with a semi-gloss polyurethane coating I happened to have around.

The plywood I got was sanded on one side but I still gave it a quick once-over with the sanding block, especially to clean up the fresh cut edges.\nWith the board cleaned of any sanding dust, I finished it with a single coat of stain and a couple coats of polyurethane.

It also should go without saying that the color and depth of stain and finish, or even just using them at all, are options best decided for your individual project and subject.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSL/RI3T/JGNWUXM8/FSLRI3TJGNWUXM8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO7/4Q8A/JGNWUXNH/FO74Q8AJGNWUXNH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUQ/TAB7/JGNWUXR6/FUQTAB7JGNWUXR6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGO/ZG3R/JGNWUXUY/FGOZG3RJGNWUXUY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Background"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Disclaimer: This is an overly complicated way to build a frame like this, especially without a table saw, so feel free to use your favorite/easier method or just skip the frame entirely.\nThe idea is to use a circular, or table if you have it, saw with the blade set to a ~1/4\" depth to cut a blind slot in the frame pieces that the background board will sit in.\nStart by cutting out four furring strips to rough lengths. You'll then need to do some math to relate where you want the slot to run in the strips and the distance between your saws guide and the blade. Don't forget about the kerf (the width the blade cuts, essentially) or you'll end up cutting too wide. Once you know where you're cutting you'll need a way to hold everything in place while you cut. I cut a few sets of offset blocks (see the second picture above) that gave me cuts at the extremes of the slot and twice in between.\nAt this point I used a screw driver and wood chisel to break, cut, and scrape out the tabs left by the saw. Don't worry if it's a little wider than the background board or if the \"floor\" of the slot isn't perfectly flat. As long as it's relatively close it should all come together in the end.\nOnce the slot is cut it's a simpler job to cut miters in both ends. (Watch your directions!) If everything matches up then it's off to paint/stain/finish. My initial plan was to just to prime and then paint the frame the same grey from the mosaic but after I started sanding the first coat I really liked the distressed look it was giving me so I just rolled with it.\nFinally I fit checked the pieces in the different positions to see what combination was the most square and had the smallest gaps in the miters. With the positions decided I used wood glue in the slot and on the mitered faces to stick everything together. Later I did come through and add a pin nail to each joint with a nail gun but that was just for piece of mind.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVC/UQ38/JGNWUXWB/FVCUQ38JGNWUXWB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJG/KML9/JGNWUXZZ/FJGKML9JGNWUXZZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F09/7EWU/JGNWUY17/F097EWUJGNWUY17.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT3/26T4/JGNWUY19/FT326T4JGNWUY19.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ1/7I8P/JGNWUY1F/FQ17I8PJGNWUY1F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNJ/LT0R/JGNWUY1G/FNJLT0RJGNWUY1G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLE/EOVT/JGNWUY1J/FLEEOVTJGNWUY1J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWJ/D3L9/JGNWUY1K/FWJD3L9JGNWUY1K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE5/4ZG3/JGNWUY1M/FE54ZG3JGNWUY1M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNG/WVPC/JGNWUY2W/FNGWVPCJGNWUY2W.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Frame"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "We've had the tedium, now it's time for the stress.\nBecause of the very narrow gap between my pieces and deadline pressure (i.e. finishing the night before the big day) I didn't attempt to come up with a clever way to transfer the pieces to the frame so I was placing them by sight. Knowing I couldn't backtrack if things didn't come together in the end was more than a little nerve-wracking.\nInstead I just assembled everything on the template, next to the frame, and then moved several pieces over at a time, without glue, and got them in position. Working from the unglued piece that was most constrained, I applied a thin glue layer then pressed it into place and tweaked it's position until it looked right compared to the pieces around it.\nIn the end you may have to do a little jockeying, as I did with the small pieces around the eye, to get everything to fit. Once everything does fit though and the glue is dried all that's left to do is choose a place of honor, or a gift wrap.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQR/DD3U/JGNWUY2Y/FQRDD3UJGNWUY2Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJD/GD65/JGNWUY30/FJDGD65JGNWUY30.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP3/17V4/JGNWUY31/FP317V4JGNWUY31.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F41/BLNY/JGNWUY32/F41BLNYJGNWUY32.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Mosaic-ing"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Congrats and thank you for slogging through my head-scratchingly verbose guide.

Word is there could be treats for any who do. ;D\nIf somehow you just haven't had enough of my dull prose then continue on for my final thoughts and some stuff I'd do differently next time, otherwise, thank you again for reading.\nPost-mortem\nI know some of my methods probably caused minor strokes among the more professional and skilled woodworkers out there. That said I'm quite proud of the results and think anyone with even a little experience with their tools (this was my first real attempt at using the scroll saw) and a moderate level of equipment (e.g. I do have a scroll saw but not a table saw) should be able to produce pieces of similar quality.\nI'm very happy with how the limited, high-contrast color palate works. Especially how it really makes the blue of the eye pop. I think the finish on the background and the frame sort of wrap the whole package up and give it a nice clean, \"elevated\" look. On the other hand I wish I had gone with slightly larger mosaic pieces throughout and had a wider gap between pieces. Also if you're up close you can see the texture/finish difference between the eyes and nose pieces and everything else.\nLessons\nWhen I was gluing pieces and made it up through the neck I started working up the back of the head and down towards the mouth at the same time. Working in two directions at once is a mistake. This is the reason I had to spend twenty minutes jockeying the last set of pieces around the eye into place. Luckily I was able to make it work but it's not perfect, even though I'm probably the only one that can tell. It could have been a small disaster though, requiring prying most, if not all, the prior pieces off.\nDoing this again I'd probably lightly sand the area where the pieces are glued. It hasn't been a problem yet but it's possible the glue isn't bound well with the polyurethane and pieces might need reattached later.\nA belt sander is the one tool I didn't have that I would seriously recommend. Sanding 109 pieces by hand was exceedingly tedious, rough on the hands and wrists, and wore through the finger on my glove.\nThanks to user spystealth1 for reminding me: This would be an absolutely perfect project for those lucky folks with easy access to a laser cutter. It certainly would be easier but might lose some of that hand worked charm from the imperfect cuts, if that's a consideration to you. You could probably get some of that back by hand sanding the edges though.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLW/WIS7/JH0TNQOJ/FLWWIS7JH0TNQOJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX2/2H3V/JGNWUY35/FX22H3VJGNWUY35.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Thoughts & Lessons Learned"}], "channel": "Decorating"}, {"category": "Home", "description": "This is a DIY squishy putty that will help you clean hard-to-reach nooks and crannies just by rolling it around in them.

Containers without a drainage hole can lead to water collecting in the bottom and causing root rot. (Root rot is often fatal for plants and nearly impossible to reverse.)\nCeramic and terra cotta containers can be drilled using a masonry drill bit, and plastic containers can be drilled using almost any sharp drill bit. There are loads of guides online for doing this, so I highly suggest looking up how to drill into the material your container is made of.\nUsing a cheap plastic pot inside of a decorative container is another clever way to get drainage without drilling into the container.

Pots that are too big can cause a plant to sit in water for too long or cause nutrient burn from the large amount of nutrients the soil ends up holding. A pot that's too small can cause a plant to become rootbound, leaving very little soil available to hold on to water.\nDon't make a drastic jump in sizes\nIf you have a plant in a four inch pot, it's best to move up to the next size - a six inch pot! Don't go crazy and double the pot size, as it will take a long time for the plant to fill the pot and increase your chances of over watering it.\nChoose deeper pots for plants with large roots, and shallower ones for plants with small roots\nLarge houseplants with a ton of foliage tend to develop deeper, larger root systems and can handle being put in a pot as tall as it is wide. Succulents and cacti do well in shallower pots.\nIf all else fails, check the roots\nIf you're really unsure about which direction to go, gently remove the plant from its current pot and check the roots. Are they filling out the pot? If so, go up a size. If you see an equal amount of soil and roots, chances are the plant is fine in the current pot size. If you see loads of soil and very little roots, you may want to go down a size if the plant or its roots look unhealthy.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FK8/G2XM/JGWJ9UHY/FK8G2XMJGWJ9UHY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Choosing the Right Size Pot for Your Plant"}], "channel": "Gardening"}, {"category": "Home", "description": "So, I've just started college and 1 week in I've realized something.

Things such as chandelier, clothing rack, and makeup desk have come up while we brainstormed. However, in consideration of the time and materials limits, we have finally decided on making a simple makeup desk.\nThis makeup desk is a size of a tray table; it can be placed either on the floor, or on your bed. The desk itself comes with a mirror, jewelry storage, and LED lightings. It is nicely designed as well as environmental friendly.\n________________________________________________________________________________\nThings You Need:\nAll materials are up cycled as required, we got most of the wood from UC Davis Woodshop, and the rest are just recycled stuff from our household.\n1.

But this is what I've came up with.\nIn the bicycle service workshop I bought a couple of used tires (one was punctured and the other one was torn in large area) It costed me almost nothing. I cut them into ~90cm long strips (one tire gives 4 of them, and it's ok if they're somewhat shorter). Then I glued them into rings using natural rubber based glue (follow the instructions on the package).\nAlso I cut a bunch of wooden blocks (I have rounded the corners so that they don't puncture the rubber), and made a simple jig out of scrap piece of particle board (drill 4 holes in the corners of ~32cm rectangle, and use nails as pins (or something suitable)).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8C/XXI8/JGNWTTYS/F8CXXI8JGNWTTYS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9Q/L43D/JGNWTTYV/F9QL43DJGNWTTYV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FML/T2I5/JGNWTTZR/FMLT2I5JGNWTTZR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXJ/AYYC/JGNWTTZV/FXJAYYCJGNWTTZV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGJ/0FUA/JGNWTU0G/FGJ0FUAJGNWTU0G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEF/LQHV/JGNWTTXM/FEFLQHVJGNWTTXM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4:"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Here's my set up for the gluing process. And here's the sequence of opperations:\n- Insert pins into jig;\n- pull the rubber ring onto pins;\n- place the bottom piece of the pannel box inside the ring;\n- take the wall piece and apply glue onto grooves (mne glue is latex based, but PVA based glue will also do the job (or do your own research));\n- assamble the details around the bottom piece (on the last picture two neigbouring walls are shown from underneath; the recess for the bottom is creayed);\n- insert wooden blocks between the rubber band and the walls of the pannel;\n- remove pins (nails) one by one;\n- adjust all the details to put them into place and close the gap;\n- put the pannel onto plane surface for the glue to dry.\nHere I want to say a few words about the design. There's a lot of ways to make a box like this, but I choose this one because it works perfectly with the way I'm gluing the details. Since the grooves provide self regestering structure I can use only a rubber band to clamp all pieces, because I know thet everything will be square anyway. and won't slide away under preassure. The wooden blocks serve to transfer the dirrection of the force applyed to the sides of the construction instead of it's corners. You can leave the pannels clamped with bands for a couple of hours untill the glue sets up, and then use the bands to clamp the next bunch.\nThe other advantage of this design is that every detail has the same dimmentions (for each dimmention-type pannel) and can be processed in the same way, which reduces the ammount of opperations. But again, this is my reasoning, and if you feel that something different will work better for you - go your own way.\nGlue all the pannels.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0O/RXBM/JGSGNXGS/F0ORXBMJGSGNXGS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSU/3MZH/JGSGNXGT/FSU3MZHJGSGNXGT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSF/3QFP/JGNWTUAR/FSF3QFPJGNWTUAR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL9/NMMV/JGNWTUAY/FL9NMMVJGNWTUAY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1W/SSNS/JGNWTUB4/F1WSSNSJGNWTUB4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP9/TRUK/JGNWTUBT/FP9TRUKJGNWTUBT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH7/630A/JGNWTUCH/FH7630AJGNWTUCH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQP/GSAE/JGNWTUDT/FQPGSAEJGNWTUDT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTY/YLKX/JGNWTUEH/FTYYLKXJGNWTUEH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIV/J064/JGNWTUAE/FIVJ064JGNWTUAE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6D/O4AW/JGSGO3GD/F6DO4AWJGSGO3GD.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5:"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "After gluing I've been left with these recesses on the corners of the pannel boxes.

For exterior use, my suggestion would be to use cedar lumber; this is common for exterior planter boxes and it's OK to have direct contact with soil. Of course, any protection wouldn't hurt.

Fortunately, I found an old Zenith console for free on Craigslist that would've been thrown out otherwise, and the craziest part about it is that the TV console predates me by 4 years. It is pretty cool, though, to know that I'm giving new life to tech older than me..\nAnyways, here's all you'll need to disassemble an old TV and reassemble it as a fish tank:\nTOOLS\nDisassembly:\nFlat head an Phillips head screw driver assortment\nSocket assortment\nWooden hammer (for light prying and glue loosening)\nHammer and/or hand sledge (or forceful prying and convincing old glue to come loose)\nFurniture cart (makes moving the TV around a lot easier)\nFlat xacto knife\nReassembly:\nScrew drivers\nPocket hole jig\nHose (for filling the tank.

You may need to find a smaller or larger tank depending on the size of the console you are able to get (and adjust the size of your supports), but the most important thing is that the width and height of the tank you choose are equal to or greater than the width and height of the CRT in your console.

This will require a variety of screwdrivers and socket wrenches, so see the pictures for various scenarios you will likely encounter. The main goal of this step is to allow the tank to sit as close to the front wall of the console as possible.\nOnce all the electronics and supports are removed, you can use an xacto knife or other sharp knife to cut away any of the plastic CRT trim that hangs back past the front wall of the console.\nAs for the top panel of the console, free up enough of the supports to remove the lid for easy access to the fish tank once it is in place and full of water. For the Zenith console, this just consist of removing some screws and prying loose some glue like the pictures for this step.\n**Note**\nAn important thing for aesthetics is to hang on to the black cover for the TV's IR receiver and remember to add it back to the TV console before the end of the project.

I went for a Jumanji-themed tank! I got some various jungle-y aquarium decorations for my tank online, as well as an in-tank filter since a normal filter would not fit on the back of the tank with the TV console top on. I also got some RGB LEDs to help light up the tank.\nFor the tank theme, choose something TV-related you like, and pick some tank decorations to go with the theme. To add to the 'TV realism' of the tank, you can print out a large format scene from a TV show or move and add it to the back wall of the tank. You can use Microsoft Paint to help with resizing and printing across multiple pages (see the pictures and annotations for more info), and the advantage of using basic printer paper for your picture is that you can add a backlight to help it pop. If you go this route, take extra care to trim the pictures as close to the edge as possible and use packing tape to connect the sheets while avoiding dark patches in the picture when the light is on. Also, to help keep the image visible, you can put up thick plastic to block out any unwanted light. Electrical tape works well for holding the plastic in place and blocking out light.\nFor the LED strip, attach it to the top panel of the console towards the back, and if there is an IR controller for it, you can put that where the TV's original IR receiver was. I have my LED receiver attached to the back of the top panel, and it works great.\nWhen it comes to filling the tank, start with the gravel and then use whatever means you have to add water to it. This may consist of using buckets or pans to transport water to the tank, or if you are lucky like me, you can just run a garden hose inside to fill the tank quickly. Make sure the tank is positioned where you want it before you start filling it since the water will make it hard to move. Also, add your tank decorations once the tank is about half full. Once the tank is full, add some water conditioner to prep it for your fish.\nAs for the fish, choose whatever fish you like! I went with a couple of neon tetras, a couple of zebrafish, a red wag platy, a black molly, and a plecostomus.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDX/VHVD/JGCJBTVL/FDXVHVDJGCJBTVL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLX/UFV9/JGCJBTVK/FLXUFV9JGCJBTVK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ5/XPJX/JGCJBTVJ/FQ5XPJXJGCJBTVJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FID/1SQE/JGCJBUYZ/FID1SQEJGCJBUYZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0Q/70L7/JGCJBTV4/F0Q70L7JGCJBTV4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1K/HDQG/JGCJBTVH/F1KHDQGJGCJBTVH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN0/G4SE/JGCJBTV5/FN0G4SEJGCJBTV5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3W/NM1O/JGCJBTV1/F3WNM1OJGCJBTV1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMT/V1IF/JGCJBTV2/FMTV1IFJGCJBTV2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBK/JZF3/JGCJBTV6/FBKJZF3JGCJBTV6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGX/1EWK/JGCJBTV7/FGX1EWKJGCJBTV7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRD/V8R0/JGCJBTV8/FRDV8R0JGCJBTV8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRJ/82NH/JGCJBTVM/FRJ82NHJGCJBTVM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFB/WGXQ/JGCJBTVA/FFBWGXQJGCJBTVA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDK/NS1S/JGCJBTVB/FDKNS1SJGCJBTVB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4O/PH02/JGCJBTVC/F4OPH02JGCJBTVC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDZ/9LQV/JGCJBTVI/FDZ9LQVJGCJBTVI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH7/MN3V/JGCJBTVD/FH7MN3VJGCJBTVD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQC/ARR8/JGCJBTV9/FQCARR8JGCJBTV9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6O/AS6X/JGCJBTVE/F6OAS6XJGCJBTVE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Fish and Decorations"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Now that you have an awesome fish tank TV, make sure you take some time to watch your fish swimming around!\nIf you enjoyed this project as much as me and my cat, Catsper, have any ideas or suggestions or want to share pics of your own fish tank TVs, leave a comment below or message me!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F83/0UBF/JGCJBTVW/F830UBFJGCJBTVW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8E/EOCM/JGCJBTVN/F8EEOCMJGCJBTVN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDW/NJCB/JGCJBTVV/FDWNJCBJGCJBTVV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5A/ORDV/JGCJBTVZ/F5AORDVJGCJBTVZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP9/8GND/JGCJBTVX/FP98GNDJGCJBTVX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS2/AJ1C/JGCJBTVO/FS2AJ1CJGCJBTVO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC1/6KPY/JGCJBTVR/FC16KPYJGCJBTVR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLH/B2Q9/JGCJBTVP/FLHB2Q9JGCJBTVP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGB/250R/JGCJBTVQ/FGB250RJGCJBTVQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Enjoy!"}], "channel": "Pets"}, {"category": "Home", "description": "Several months ago I got this nice photophore you can see above.

I live in a relatively small apartment so I do not have a lot of furniture, and it is full of basic stuff already (3D printer, PLA spools, soldering iron, Arduino boards, jumper wires...).\nSo I thought about a shelf that would fit into my apartment to hold this photophore.

It is a square with edges of 11.5 cm (just enough to be printed with my MP Select Mini!). There is also a border, in case the object placed on the plate slides.

But when the egg is placed on a ferromagnetic surface the magnet is attracted by the surface, connecting the battery to the LED, and it closes the loop: the current flows and the LED lights up.

Therefore if you rotate the egg of 180\u00b0, you can switch the LED ON or OFF.\nBelow are 2 different methods to make this nightlight:\nWith basic stuff (steps 1 to 4).\nWith 3D printed parts to hold the battery, magnet and LED (steps 5 to 7).", "title": "How to Make a Magnetic Nightlight Egg", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Magnetic-Nightlight-Egg/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "You will need:\nTape.

I will say that if you have a gate at the top of a set of stairs, you may not want the gate to swing towards the steps, especially with kids. If the gate would swing open over the steps and it was a baby, it would be bad. Think through all of this and give yourself a bit of a plan to know how to make your cuts.\nAfter you have the overall size of the gate established, you can cut all your boards.

Using TinkerCad's online design tool and using basic shapes I designed a bracket that would attach to the top of the Tri-Pod and allow for the existing Spotlight attachment point to be re-used.\n\nTinkerCad is based on basic shapes like boxes, cylinders and also text along with the ability to make an shape a \"hole\". The design was pretty basic but I wanted to add some flair by adding my last name to it and to also create cap to cover the bolt holding it to the Tri-Pod. Because I wanted to print this in Bronze (using the Shapeways.com printing service) I had to keep it as small as possible to keep the costs down. I had a $100 Gift certificate from a Christmas gift so I wanted to keep the cost in that range.\n\nTinkerCad has built in measurements so I could make the light attachment area the exact 1/2 Inch that was required. The exploded image view shows how the basic shapes come together to product the object. Because this is such a one of a kind piece it have not included the STL files or the exact instructions as they is only a very slim possibility someone else would require a part exactly this size and shape.\n\nOnce the object is complete is TinkerCad I exported it as an STL document to be imported into ShapeWays which is an amazing service to print objects in material from plastic to ceramic & from bronze to gold.

This time I'm here with a wonderful piece of art. If you're looking for something that is related to the cosmos, it cannot be complete without Stephen Hawking in it. Almost everyone of you have heard of the news that our beloved Professor Stephen Hawking had passed away a less than a month ago. Really sorry for the saddening sentence at the beginning of the instructable.\nSo it happened that I was remembering him after seeing a series narrated by him on TV and was shocked by his genius capabilities. If you want to watch it too, please mention it in the comments and I'll provide the YouTube link.\nNews apart, let's get to the topic. I actually wanted to make a piece of art as a tribute to Prof. Hawking. I'm a self taught artist and making art is a passion to me, not my profession. I was actually bored of those black and white portraits (which I drew :-p) and wanted to make something different. So ready to roll? Let's begin!!\nTo make this art you'll need,\nWatercolor papers\nWatercolors/poster colours\nPencil and eraser\nWeights (I used magnets)\nPaint brushes\nSponge\nCorrection pen (optional)\nScissors", "title": "Cosmos Wall Art - a Tribute to Stephen Hawking", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Cosmos-Wall-Art-a-Tribute-to-Stephen-Hawking/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Here, as you can see, I'm busy with the basic outlines. Trust me, it takes a lot of patience to get it right. So, the easy way is to download the PDF from the link below and take a printout of it. Paste it on a chart paper with evenly spread glue. Then you may cut along the edges with a pair of scissors.\nDownload the stencil here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ydABOiRHGNVxQgA0cV9RTIUc0RflPj66/view?usp=drivesdk\nNow if you're like me and want to make sure that the art is completely of your own, you can directly draw the image from your PC/smartphone rather than taking a printout. It's better to use some sort of hard sheet like a chart paper. Frankly, you don't need to be an artist to make art. Its as easy as baking a cake and as fun as playing with kids!\nFine, so we were drawing. Make sure to draw continuous lines so that it is easy to cut it out.

I wanted the rope to be pretty tight once it went through the drilled holes so I made sure it was as snug fit with some test holes before drilling the actual boards. I would recommend doing this. I think my rope and drill bit size was \u00bc\u201d. I measured in 1\u201d from the side of the board and \u00bd\u201d from the end of the boards at each corner.\nWhen I drilled the hole I made sure to put another piece of board under and clamp them together so I wouldn\u2019t get tear out from drilling. This is a great trick especially when you are drilling larger holes.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIH/DQ8V/JFMT8QYI/FIHDQ8VJFMT8QYI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOQ/J592/JFMT8QYJ/FOQJ592JFMT8QYJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP2/CJQ8/JFMT8QYK/FP2CJQ8JFMT8QYK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMC/7IB0/JFMT8QYM/FMC7IB0JFMT8QYM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFM/WYFG/JFMT8QYP/FFMWYFGJFMT8QYP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Make the Boards"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The next thing I had to do was cut out the holes for the pots to fit in. I used 4\u201d clay pots that I picked up from my local home center. I had to make sure the pots would not fall through the hole I cut, so the first thing I did was measure my pot and determine my hole size. It was exactly 4\u201d in diameter. I marked where my holes needed to be and then drew a circle where I would cut each hole out. To make a perfect circle without a compass, I tied a piece of string to a pencil and the other side to a wood screw 2\u201d apart.\nThen I drill the screw part way in on the center mark of where I wanted a hole to be. Then, keeping my pencil straight, I went around the screw in a circle. This worked great for creating a perfect circle. If I were to do this again, I would just purchase a hole saw and use that, but I didn\u2019t have one for this project so used a jigsaw. I made a large pilot hole inside the drawn circle to have a place to start with the jigsaw, and then I cut out each circle. Cut slow and let the blade do the cutting. I went very fast at first and had to redo a few mistakes. It does work great though.\nI sanded the inside of the holes until I got rid of most of the jigsaw cut marks and then with the random orbital sander, I sanded the boards up to 220 grit sandpaper.

As I've gotten more into canning and preserving food, I noticed just how much sugar I was using. In addition to being a sweetener, sugar is useful for dehydrating fruits and is itself a preservative.\nThere is some research and information online about using liquid sweeteners such as honey in preserving, but most recipes call for granular sugar. Syrups such as maple syrup or sorghum are typically not used, as they impart a strong flavor on whatever is being preserved.\nI looked around online for a few years trying to find good information on creating sugar from beets at home, and didn't come up with much. A few blogs that posted about this process were sorely lacking on specific information and pictures. Nevertheless, their information was a great starting point into the process.\nHowever, I figured the best way to learn was to take the plunge and just do it myself.\nI tried two batches of beet sugar- the first was a failure, and is not included here. The second was relatively successful, and I think is a good starting point to anyone who wants to try to do this themselves.

They are a separate species grown specifically for their high sugar content- they average approximately 15% sucrose by weight. Traditionally they are used for animal fodder, which leads some people to think they are not fit for human consumption.\nThe beet greens are edible and supposedly similar to swiss chard; I did not try this myself, however. The beets themselves were like taking a bite out of any other raw beet.\nI purchased the seeds online from Pine Tree Seeds; with some research they should be easy to find, though they are not common. I planted the beets in 3 rows in a patch approximately 18\" by 5 feet, in sandy clay soil. I watered them regularly throughout summer and waited until after the first hard frost in November to harvest them. Waiting until after a hard frost is supposed to convert a lot of starches in the roots and leaves into sugar. The beets were dug with a regular spading fork, and in total weighed around 30 pounds.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5W/PV7P/JBWK2GHP/F5WPV7PJBWK2GHP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: A Little Bit About Sugar Beets"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "After searching online for how to make beet sugar, I found a number of similarities between techniques. The basic method is as follows, with a few modifications of my own. It is largely complied from other sources:\nWash, peel, and remove bad parts of beets. I chose to remove the green skinned parts of the beets, as they seemed to be much darker and softer on the inside (see picture).\nShred or dice beets, then cover with water in a large pot.\nBring to a boil, then simmer until beets are tender. This was between 1 and 2 hours for me.\nDrain the liquid from the beets. Collect the beet pulp in a strainer lined with cheese cloth or similar material.\nPress liquid from the beet pulp and combine with the rest of the sugar water.\nReduce sugar water until it turns amber brown and has a consistency like honey.\nAllow to crystalize.\nThe industrial method for creating beet sugar is much more complex than this. I would also like to mention that the method above will create something very much like raw sugar or brown sugar. That is, it creates sugar that has not had its molasses separated out. I was unable to find good information on how to do this without a large industrial centrifuge. As a result, it will not taste anything like regular white sugar.\nA large part of industrial beet sugar production involves removing minerals and impurities from the sugar water. In an effort to reduce the amount going in to my test batches, I chose to skin the beets and remove any parts of the beet that were brown on the interior.

I decided to shred the beets using a cheese grater instead of slicing them. A food processor could also make this go quickly. I thought it would allow for a higher surface area of beet for creating the sugar water.\nI filled a stock pot with shredded beet and topped with water, then brought to a boil. I simmered the beet slivers until they were very soft and falling apart, stirring regularly.\nI strained the sugar water out of the pot, then squeezed the beet pulp in a cloth to get more liquid out. This took a while, as the beet pulp clogged the cloth and left some liquid behind. A press of some sort would probably be more efficient, but I was using equipment I already had on hand in my kitchen.\nThe resulting sugar solution can be seen in the glass in the last picture.

Two of the pans I seeded with a sprinkle of regular white sugar; the other two I left alone.

This pan was one which had added sugar. You can see the hard crust of sugar which has formed across the top of the entire pan. The fourth picture shows a pan without added sugar, and the difference is striking.

Notice the crystal structure forming all over. Some pockets had molasses mixed in with the sugar, while others (as on the right) seemed to be much more pure sugar.\nTo process the sugar down, I broke small pieces about the size of a fingertip out of the trays. Because the trays were aluminum, I could just flex the bottom and it broke up well on its own.\nAt first I tried pounding the sugar apart by putting it in a plastic bag and hitting it with a meat tenderizer. This left me with a small amount of finely powdered sugar, a lot of large pieces, and a ripped-up plastic bag.\nI settled on using a clean pepper mill (the kind you find full of whole peppercorns in the grocery store) and this seems to work pretty well. It's time-consuming, however; a flour or grain mill might also work if you have one of those. The pepper mill gave me a well-ground sugar about the size of regular sugar crystals.\nFrom the 5 pounds of beets I started with, I wound up with just under 1 pound of sugar, which is right in that 15-20% sucrose range you can expect from sugar beets.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZO/ULIM/JFIIQMH8/FZOULIMJFIIQMH8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYB/9U3H/JFIIQMHI/FYB9U3HJFIIQMHI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEP/1L0P/JFIIWSC7/FEP1L0PJFIIWSC7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTP/XEQ4/JFIIWSC9/FTPXEQ4JFIIWSC9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYS/GUFD/JFIIQMHV/FYSGUFDJFIIQMHV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Processing the Sugar"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "So there you have it, how to make your own sugar at home using sugar beets.

Not for my wife a few desultory plastic containers; she has dozens of mason jars in four different sizes that fill many shelves in a normal cabinet and generate a sorting problem when you're trying to locate a herb or a spice you haven't used for a while. Here's my modular solution. Because I've designed it for jars of 4, 8, 16 and 32 oz, you could redo it using any one (or more) of the sizes that best suited your needs.", "title": "Cabinet Spice Rack", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Cabinet-Spice-Rack-1/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The main idea of a spice cabinet is to present everything so you can see all your options at once, or at least easily access them. I settled on making arcs of jars with all jars of the same size on the same layer. I have access to a laser cutter, so fabricating the shelves would be straightforward. I planned to use the holes drilled inside the IKEA cabinets for shelf support in exactly the same way as they're used for regular shelves.\nI used Fusion 360 to design the shelves. I measured the size of the cabinet (it's nominally 18\" wide, 15\" deep and 40\" high) and drew a rectangle, then measured each jar and calculated how wide the shelf needed to be (giving some space around each jar). That defined a distance for the sides at the front and the middle at the back. The easiest way to produce a smooth arc was with the ellipse tool, and I drew three: one to define the front edge, another to define the midpoint of the circle that would hold the jar, and a third for the back of the shelf. I then drew a circle large enough to hold the base of the jar on each side. I measured the length of the remaining arc and calculated how many jars I could fit in, then divided the distance evenly by that number. It worked out that I could fit 9 small or medium (4 or 8 oz) jars, 7 large (16 oz) jars, and 5 very large (1 quart) jars. Aesthetically this was nice because there was always a central jar at the back.\nAll four shelves are attached to this step as .dxf files for cutting. Note there are two shapes for each shelf: one is to be cut out of 1/4\" (6 mm) plywood for the base of the shelf, and the other out of 1/8\" (3 mm) plywood for the rings.\nNote: we have 4 different sized jars for historical reasons, and the larger ones are for herbs that we grow in our garden. I suggest if you're making this yourself, pick the most practical size for you (I recommend the 8 oz \"medium\" sized jar) and stock all your spices in those (double-up when you need to). If you have a router and want to save money on laser-cutting, just laser cut one of the horseshoe-shaped holey parts and use it as a template - you could do something quite cool then and rout out each spice shelf out of 3/16\" plywood and cut the holes to a fixed depth.

Although eggs, in general, were a traditional symbol of fertility and rebirth,[2] in Christianity, for the celebration of Eastertide, Easter eggs symbolize the empty tomb of Jesus, from which Jesus resurrected.[3][4][5] In addition, one ancient tradition was the staining of Easter eggs with the colour red \"in memory of the blood of Christ, shed as at that time of his crucifixion.\"[3][6] This custom of the Easter egg can be traced to early Christians of Mesopotamia, and from there it spread into Russia and Siberia through the Orthodox Churches, and later into Europe through the Catholic and Protestant Churches.[6][7][8][9] This Christian use of eggs may have been influenced by practices in \"pre-dynastic period in Egypt, as well as amid the early cultures of Mesopotamia and Crete\".[10] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg)\nI like this one, too:\nEaster Egg Coloring (with rice)", "title": "How to Color Easter Eggs", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Color-Easter-Eggs/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Food color\nVinegar\nMeasuring cup\nSpoon\nHard boiled eggs\nA few glasses or cups", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBC/JFYX/JFCT5SXB/FBCJFYXJFCT5SXB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMI/C16X/JFCT5SXC/FMIC16XJFCT5SXC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY2/7WOL/JFCT5SXD/FY27WOLJFCT5SXD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM6/1P39/JFCT5SXE/FM61P39JFCT5SXE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU2/FYHV/JFCT5SY5/FU2FYHVJFCT5SY5.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: You Need:"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Fill the food color into your glasses....one color per glass.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FV0/V8C5/JFCT5SXF/FV0V8C5JFCT5SXF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDU/7DX8/JFCT5SXH/FDU7DX8JFCT5SXH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9F/7PMV/JFCT5SXK/F9F7PMVJFCT5SXK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4E/O2BQ/JFCT5SXQ/F4EO2BQJFCT5SXQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM2/CIXY/JFCT5SXO/FM2CIXYJFCT5SXO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJE/QMB1/JFCT5SXX/FJEQMB1JFCT5SXX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTI/YCK2/JFCT5SXY/FTIYCK2JFCT5SXY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8I/OJ5X/JFCT5SXZ/F8IOJ5XJFCT5SXZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQE/DJ5G/JFCT5SY0/FQEDJ5GJFCT5SY0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Start"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Now:\nWe need water!

An average living Christmas tree takes approximately 10 years of growing before it is ready to be cut and sold. In this growing period, thousands of gallons of water, chemicals, and labor are employed to maintain it. Obviously an artificial Christmas tree is the eco-friendly choice, right? Well, not really. The average family uses an artificial tree for 5 or 6 years before tossing it and getting another. The trees themselves are generally made from metals such as steel and aluminum and polyvinyl chloride, which is interwoven into the steel limbs. This makes them exceedingly difficult to recycle, and as a result hundreds of thousands of faux trees each year are hauled to the curb and sent to landfill, where they don't degrade. What if there were a way to recycle those trees, if even for just a few more years, and to have one of the best holiday decorations in the neighborhood that can't be purchased at any store?\nThis instructable will show you a very quick and easy way to make an awesome, GIANT wreath for your yard, the side of your house, or even your shipping container (if you've got one of those). There aren't many extra materials needed, the tools are relatively straightforward and easy to come by, and almost anybody can make one of these. The best part is that if you set aside an entire day to do this, you'll have more than enough time afterward to marvel at your handiwork.

All of these things are dangerous if you don't pay attention to what you are doing. ALWAYS wear protection. Eyeballs don't grow back, burns don't feel great, and falling off a ladder can cause serious bodily harm and even death. Do this with supervision, even if one of your friends is just watching you do your thing. Have them hold the ladder, if nothing else. When welding AWLAYS wear eye protection, always wear something that fully covers your arms and legs, closed toed shoes, and leather gloves. When using a grinder, use a face shield. They throw sparks and minuscule pieces of cut off wheel and metal- right at your face and eyes. Lastly, if you are unsure of how to operate something, ask somebody who does. It never hurts to ask, and you can never learn too much.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: DISCLAIMER"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The materials list for this project is very short and very easy to obtain. It doesn't cost much and if you search around your garage, shop, or basement you may find everything you need to make this for free.\nThe most important item in this project is an old, used artificial tree. They're a lot easier to come by than you think. Search craigslist around the holidays, especially just after. Ask your friends and their families, your family members. Chances are if you tell them what you plan to do, they may be more willing to part with that old tree and get a new one, or start buying fresh cut trees. If you plan to do this for the following year, keep an eye out on curbs just after the beginning of January when most people take their holiday decorations down. Our tree came from my mother-in-law; it was missing a couple branches and starting to look a little scraggly.\nOne thing to note- keep a small magnet with you. Chances are the limbs will be made of inexpensive steel twisted around the PVC green needles. Ferrous metal (a magnet will attract to it) is very simple to weld strongly. Not that you can't weld other metals, but mild steel is by far the easiest. Essentially, an artificial tree is a large post full of glorified pipe cleaners, and it's the pipe cleaner branches that get welded to a frame.\nBILL OF MATERIALS:\nArtificial tree. See above notes on this if you skipped straight to the list\nRebar. You'll need two 6' or 5' sections, depending on how large or dense you want the wreath. These are the most expensive materials you will need for this project, and they can be readily found in the concrete and cement section of any hardware store. You may also need a 1' section, cut in half (You only need this if you are welding support brackets to something made of metal, like a shipping container)\nA very large \"S\" hook. Make sure you don't get stainless, otherwise welding it to the rebar will be a problem. Stainless is also more expensive. Simple galvanized will do- you will be grinding the zinc coating away later anyway.\nBelieve it or not, that's all you need in materials. The tools required for this project are just as simple and straightforward.\nTOOLS:\nWelder. You can use any welder. Most hobbyists have/are comfortable with/use a wire feed MIG welder. I prefer to use an inexpensive \"lunchbox\" inverter stick welder from harbor freight- and I love it, especially for the ease of use, nearly nonexistent maintenance, cheap operating costs and portability. If you don't have a welder, ask around. Chances are that somebody you know will have one and be happy to help out or lend it to you.\nAngle grinder and metal cut off wheels. Again, I have an inexpensive HF grinder. It cost less than $20 over 2 years ago, and has been through the wringer. Run over in the dark with a truck, left outside in a flash rainstorm, and dropped off a shipping container a few times and still runs like its new. I buy the cut off discs there too by the 5 and 10 pack. I consider them consumables. You'll probably need a few of them for this project.\nWelding and safety equipment. I set this aside from the welder because there's enough to list on it's own. You will need a box or two of electrodes. 5lb should be plenty. I like 6011, 6013, and 7018 electrodes. 6011 are very forgiving and can be found most anywhere. You will also need a face shield, the half-helmet with a nearly black lens in it or an auto darkening helmet if you're lucky enough to have access to one. Thick leather long cuff gloves, overalls and long sleeve shirts are always helpful. Also a clear plastic face shield for grinding should be used.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDC/BEEI/JF34N29Y/FDCBEEIJF34N29Y.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Materials and Tools"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "This step is just as awkward as it looks. I'm sure a jig could be built, or a simple clamp-and-pole, but this worked just fine, too. Rebar is pretty easy to bend, especially in longer lengths like this. Wearing gloves is a good idea in this step, the rebar isn't terribly comfortable on bare hands. Make two half-circles, one from each piece of rebar- that way when you put the two together you have one giant circle. you want the ends to overlap slightly by a few inches on either side. Don't worry if the circle isn't perfectly round, you can adjust the circle further when its welded in a circle and it will all be covered anyway.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKF/P122/JF34N2CG/FKFP122JF34N2CG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFN/RT67/JF34N2ER/FFNRT67JF34N2ER.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTM/4RNR/JF34N2DA/FTM4RNRJF34N2DA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBM/S3Q6/JF34N2C3/FBMS3Q6JF34N2C3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8U/8C9U/JF34N2CR/F8U8C9UJF34N2CR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJD/3DBF/JF34N2DN/FJD3DBFJF34N2DN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEA/M0FC/JF34N2E1/FEAM0FCJF34N2E1.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Bend the Rebar Frame"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "This is where a lot of people feel this project is beyond their skill level. In reality, this is an excellent project to start out welding on. There aren't any major structural welds needed and it requires a lot of quick, short welds rather than long continuous beads. This will help you get a feel for striking an arc and stopping without sticking. With a simple welder like the one I use, getting a feel for proper arc length comes very fast. Not to mention that the welds are all covered by overlapping the branches by the end, and won't be visible whether they're pretty or ugly.\nOn a flat, nonflammable surface, set your two pieces of rebar down and adjust them so that they form the best circle while still overlapping slightly. I have a large level gravel space at the end of our drive, next to the house. It's outside and far from things that could catch fire. If you have a garage, turn on a fan directing air away from yourself to help carry fumes away and know where the fire extinguisher is, just in case. If the garage belongs to your parents, your friends, your spouse or somebody you want to let you use it again, I suggest not doing this directly on the garage floor. Put a piece of aluminum under the spot you are working on. Old or cheap cookie sheets work well in keeping burn marks off the concrete.\nMake sure the metal is clean and free of any paint or greases where you will be welding. Lay the circle out and tack each side in place with a couple spot welds. Then, starting with one side, run a bead across the length of touching overlap. Once cool, do the other side.

If your tree has branches that are separate from the metal \"trunk\" this is as easy as laying the metal end of the branches so that they rest on the rebar hoop. If not, you will need to cut the branches off their hinges one by one with an angle grinder. doing so isn't difficult, but it is a little time consuming.\nA good way to lay out the wreath is to start with half, or even a third of the branches and space them evenly along the diameter of the hoop, then go back and fill in the gaps with the remainder. keep in mind that once welded into place, the branches can be splayed out some to make it seem more full. Once everything is laid out nicely, go inside for 5 minutes and get a drink, do some jumping jacks, stare at the ceiling, or whatever clears your mind. Then, go back outside and look at the layout with fresh eyes and see if you still like the way everything is set up.

My limbs were bent 90 degrees at the very end where they slid into the tree and I laid them down so that the short length as well as the branch side were touching the rebar, to provide a stronger mount. When you finally come back around to the branch you started on, lift your visor and check to make sure you haven't tangled or wound yourself up in any wires. Take another break, because the rest of the welding is going to take a little while. It will be the longest part of this entire project. Starting from the same point, begin to fully weld each branch to the rebar frame. I like to make the welds as quickly as possible to prevent the plastic/PVC of the \"tree\" from igniting or generating fumes. It needs more than a tack weld, but you don't have to go overboard with the beads, either. You only need to support the weight of a single branch on each weld, and the branches don't weigh very much individually. Each branch is going to be bent and shaped in the following step to cover the point where the weld is, so if you are very new to welding, or are in a hurry, don't worry how the welds look. After the welds are all done, go back and tap each one with a chisel or slag hammer.

I did not have any magnets with me, so I used a speed square to line up the pieces of rebar, hanging over the edge by about 4 or 5 inches and tack welded the pieces in place. Once tacked down, I ran a solid bead down either side of the rebar posts and when cooled chipped the slag away.

lamp that can hold small silhouettes of symbols and archetypal images that people feel connected to and like to have present in their personal space.\nSince nature is important to me my silhouette

It might have worked in a pinch with a small rack, if you were working under the constraint of only being able to drill vertical holes.\nI decided that I would try to go for the premium arrangement and drill through heavier wood on an angle. To see how it would work I drilled an assortment of hole sizes at a few different angles and tried the bottles out in the wood.\nWith the few sample holes I was able to guesstimate the amount of space required between the holes for clearance both for a bottle and a hand to fit in to pull it out, and noticed that the angle of the hole had to be greater than the angle the wood was tilted so that the bottles sat with the majority of the weight downwards, with enough counterbalancing upwards to hold them in place.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQC/HNZD/JESSW1ZC/FQCHNZDJESSW1ZC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEL/W6KX/JESSW1ZF/FELW6KXJESSW1ZF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Testing the Holes"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Once I knew the formula for determining the hole spacing and angle I could decide what the rack capacity would be.

Notice two bits of cleverness in the jig design:\nThe front part is angled at the same angle as the hole, so that I could drill the jig holes vertically and keep them in line (not to mention keep the hole depth minimal so that my hole saws worked properly). If I had a Forstner bit and a drill press I wouldn't have to go through that effort, but I had a hole saw and a hand drill so this was good.\nThe rails were fit tight to the slat, so that vertical alignment was guaranteed.\nHowever, as you can see by the test that the bottles didn't quite line up horizontally, due to small discrepancies in where I positioned it over each piece of wood.\nTo cure that I decided to make a larger jig.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2M/HM1D/JESSW216/F2MHM1DJESSW216.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBC/JNM0/JESSW2HD/FBCJNM0JESSW2HD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOH/OAHP/JESSWBYJ/FOHOAHPJESSWBYJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAK/RVEY/JESSW1VZ/FAKRVEYJESSW1VZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Jig Test"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "To guarantee horizontal alignment I decided to make a jig that fit over all four slats at the same time.

Unlike it though I couldn't use a simple angle tool to judge the hole angle as all four had to be identical. To manage that I enlisted the aid of a small drill guide I had. It wasn't sturdy enough to handle all of the drilling, as a drill press might be, but it was good enough to get 4 holes at a consistent angle.\nThe pilot holes were something I thought to be particularly clever. The only thing the jig didn't yet provide was a way to evenly space the rows. In a previous Instructable I solved this by creating a two-level overlap so I used that general approach here as well. By creating a small pilot hole that exited exactly 4 1/2\" away from the main hole it would provide the location for the next row to be drilled, as well as the pilot to ensure those holes started correctly aligned.

I then proceed with the Instructable, without any further explicit mathematical analysis. Though by no means a mathematician myself (more of a tinkerer), in this Instructable, we will revisit some of that underlying math as best as I can express it, and extrapolate from those findings a strategy for discovering how to fold and form more dipyramids, this time with bases of any regular polygonal shape \u2013 pentagon, hexagon, octagon, etc., collectively referred to as \u2018Regular Dipyramids\u2019.\nOne of the webpages I referenced, http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SquarePyramid.html, draws attention to a mathematical formula describing a special case Square Pyramid, where (h) height, is equal to (a) length of side divided by 2, or h=a/2. I proceeded to highlight that formula, recognizing that it describes the particular model that we were learning to make, or I should say, one half of it, as we are always creating the doubled form, dipyramid. As a dipyramid, that formula reduces to the simple expression: h=a, for the height of a dipyramid is twice the height of its single form. In this Instructable we will delve deeper into the significance of that formula, and see how it relates to A series paper. Then, as noted above, we will proceed by looking at all regular pyramids, http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SquarePyramid.html, , or in our case, regular dipyramids, that conform to the same formula: h=a. Finally, we will discover how all such regular dipyramids can (theoretically) be modeled from a rectangular sheet, with a fold pattern similar to the square based example of our initial studies.\n* https://www.instructables.com/id/UnFolding-the-Mys...\nSee also: https://www.instructables.com/id/Mysteries-of-the-...", "title": "Dipyramids (Un)Masked", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Dipyramids-UnMasked/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Unlike my two previous Instructables, this one does require some simple mathematical calculations, as well as some measuring, marking, and trimming of our A4 sheets.

The lateral sides (e) are equal to the length of the hypotenuse, 90.94mm. The crease/joint line down the middle of the face gives us (s) the slant height, equal to the long leg of our right triangle, 74.25mm. Knowing a=105mm, we can find the perimeter (P), which is four times that, or 420mm.

Looking inside a half formed model (see photo) we can see that (h) height is equal to the short leg of our right triangle, 52.50, and that (R) circumradius is equal to the long leg, 74.25mm (one half of the diagonal through the square base).

Height of the pyramid will be a/2, or 42mm, which we will assume to be the short dimension of our new small right triangle of the new fold pattern. This leap comes from the notion that the sheet width will always be one half the perimeter, 420/2=210, and that the short leg of the small triangle will always be 210/n (number of sides) which gives us the 42mm. In other words, for a pentagon, the sheet will be folded into five equal lengths of 42mm along this dimension.\nTo find the long length of that triangle, we must find (R), the circumradius of a regular pentagon whose sides are 84mm, per our internal look from the previous step. To do this we will need the central angle of an octagon, 360/5=72\u2070. If we then show the inradius (r) bisecting that angle and a side, we can use that right triangle to find (R). We know right away two of its angles, 36\u2070 and 90\u2070, so the third must be 54\u2070. We also know from above, that the short leg is 42mm. Now, taking advantage of the triangle calculator:\nhttp://www.calculator.net/triangle-calculator.html\nWe can plug in three of those terms and find that r=57.81mm and R=71.46mm.\nWe now can fill in the following:\nn=5\na=84mm\ne=lateral edge (see below)\nh=42mm\ns=71.46mm\nR=71.46mm\nr=57.81mm\nP=420mm\n\u03b1=72\u2070\nSheet size:\n(n) x (h)=short length of sheet=5 x 42=210mm\n(R) x 4=long length of sheet=285.84mm\nArray: 4 by 5\nIt is not necessary to calculate (e) in order for us proceed, as it will always be the diagonal through our rectangle defined by h and R, but should one wish, it can be solved with the Pythagorean Theorem, a right triangle with legs 42 and 71.46mm gives us a hypotenuse equal to 82.89mm. In fact, it turns out that as soon as (n), (h) and (R) are known, as long as (P) is given, the sheet can easily be measured, marked, trimmed, scored, folded and formed.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 6: The Pentagonal Diyramid \u2013 When (h) = (a)"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "I\u2019ve jumped a little ahead of myself, with regard to how to find the length of our sheet, and why it is always equal to 4 times R, thus creased in four equal divisions of that length. Again, an examination of our unfolded model of the square based dipyramid, brings us to this conclusion. We can see that along the long length, the top faces (red dots) are all contained in the two quarters of the sheet on either side of center, and that the bottom (yellow) are in the outside quarters. We know that each rectangle of the total array (16) is equal to one half the total number of faces of a square based dipyramid. Therefore, it is logical to assume that the pentagon pattern will require an array of twenty, twice the number of its 10 faces. We already know that we are dividing the short length by 5, therefore the long length must get divided by 4. We will see that top and bottom faces are distributed similarly, as well.\nSo we proceed by calculating the overall length of sheet: (R)x4=285.84 which for our purposes we will call 286. We can subtract that from 297 (the A4 dimension) to determine we must trim 11mm off the long dimension of our standard sheet.\nThe sheet then gets folded in four equal parts along the long dimension, using our standard techniques shown in (Un)Folding the Mysteries.\nDividing in fifths along the short dimension requires measuring and marking, before creasing.\nScoring and creasing the diagonals is more or less straight forward, using our standard technique. However, it is important to take note that for the pentagon (and all odd sided bases), the diagonal does not go corner to corner through the center of the sheet.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLN/AY18/JE4KM67N/FLNAY18JE4KM67N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3N/VWJN/JE4KSOHL/F3NVWJNJE4KSOHL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOQ/YVX3/JE4KSOHQ/FOQYVX3JE4KSOHQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9T/02DN/JE4KSOHR/F9T02DNJE4KSOHR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ7/VJVO/JE4KSOHY/FQ7VJVOJE4KSOHY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Prepping the Sheet"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Technique is the same, see (Un)Folding the Mysteries for details.\nThe Pentagonal Dipyramid is complete!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUP/FTFQ/JE4KSQJE/FUPFTFQJE4KSQJE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWB/HI27/JE4KSQJN/FWBHI27JE4KSQJN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFT/DRMW/JE4KSQKM/FFTDRMWJE4KSQKM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Folding, Forming and Applying the Tape"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "It turns out that for all regular dipyramids, when h=a, then s=R.

Closed terrariums should not be placed in direct sunlight, as this intensity of heat can \"cook\" your plants and kill them. Closed terrariums should also be opened periodically (at least once a month for 10-20 minutes) to allow fresh air to populate the environment.\nOpen terrariums do not have a water cycle like closed terrariums, meaning they must be watered more frequently. The amount of watering necessary depends on the plant used and the layers contained within the terrarium, as some of them hold and dispel water at different rates.\n\nWhat type of container should I use?\nThe decision on the type of container to use should be made as a result of the type of plant you wish to house, the type of terrarium you want (open or closed), and your overall aesthetic desired for the terrarium. If you want a closed terrarium, be sure to get a container with a lid. Glass or plastic is fine, just so long as the container is free of chemicals or unknown liquids, as these can kill the plants or attract bugs.\n\nWhat type of plant do I use?\nBoth open and closed terrariums can house a variety of plants. However, closed terrariums are more popular for use with moisture-loving plants like ferns, ivy, and mosses, and are ideal for the user who wants to care for the plants minimally. Open terrariums are typically favored for normal house plants, succulents, and cacti. Succulents and cacti require very little maintenance, so these are popular for those who want an open terrarium with little maintenance.

The design accounted for a ~.5mm sliding tolerance which seems pretty standard on most printers. Ideally, they should have a transition fit around the copper pipe and a snug fit on the wood platforms. You could probably also devise some cheaper ways to fasten these (i.e. drilling 1/2\u201d holes in the platforms and finding a way to restrict wobble).\nI\u2019m also considering upgrading the brackets so that they can support pipe from the bottom and top both to allow for a more modular design where 1\u2019 sections of pipe can be stacked using the brackets. I think the only downside here would be less wobble support, but the structure seems so solid after bolting the pipe to the brackets that I hardly think this will be a problem.

The solution I used was to tape a wrench (long, heavy object) to one side of the pipe as shown in the image below. That way, the pipe would naturally roll so that the same side was always face down and I would always drill on the top side. In a future iteration, I may make the hole in the bracket into a slot instead to allow some twist-tolerance.

If it\u2019s really difficult, you may opt to instead take out the brackets, screw the screw into the pipe alone, and allow the brackets to rest atop the screws.

To do this just measure your width of the beard that comes from sides down from the hair ( refer the image for clarity). Mark the width on your square. Now use your rounder to draw an arc that connects the two points of the width you marked. The more precise your width and square measurements will be, more fine the arc will come out.
