I had built several recumbents and wanted to build a recumbent tandem, so I decided to build a sociable trike (side-by-sides are actually called \u201csociables\u201d).\nI had some design criteria when I started. It needed to be less than 48\u201d wide at its widest point so I could ride on wide sidewalks and bike trails in addition to the road. Because we pedal at different cadences, I wanted both sides to have independent gears and be completely independent of each other (i.e. either side could pedal, or not, and change gears without affecting the other rider). I thought it would be nice if either side could \u2018captain,\u2019 and ideally, the captain change could be made \u2018on the fly\u2019. The design had to be comfortable for long rides, stable in all conditions, and rideable with only one rider when needed. I also had thoughts of adding a tiny gas motor, or electrical drive at a later date. I wanted he design to be light and cool looking, not like a \u201cold folks ride\u201d. I wanted suspension on at least the front axle to save our backs on rough roads. It needed to be aerodynamic, but still high enough to be seen by cars and easy to get in/on. I think we accomplished all of the goals. The bike is fast and fun. It draws a crowd everywhere it goes. It is comfortable tooling along with walkers and flying down hills. It is adjustable for a wide range of rider sizes. The suspension on the front wheels makes the ride smooth and easy. Each rider has control of his own front and intermediate gears and can select his range from 21 ratios. The final drive is selected from the center handlebar and controls an additional 36 ratios. Of course, there are many duplicate or near duplicate ratios, but in theory, there are 756 ratios for each rider! This allows a wide ratio with gears low enough to climb the side of a mountain, if needed, or tall enough that your muscles are the only limit to the top speed! The comfortable riding position lets you see all the sights without straining you neck and the cockpit layout give you options of cup holders, phone mounts, or a place for your wife\u2019s book! If this sounds like a project you would like, let me know. I have developed simple ways to guarantee that the front end geometry is correct and very easy to build.

Here's how I avoid them.", "title": "How to Camp for FREE!", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Camp-for-FREE/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "It costs about $12-$20 per night for a rustic campsite at most state parks and private campgrounds around the U.S. For that you won't get an electric hook up, but you should get water and the use of a restroom or Vault Toilet. But if you do that for several nights, you're talking real money. There are other ways. Where I live, in Michigan, you can camp on state land under a program called \"Dispersed Camping\" for free. Dispersed Camping is basically heading out away from the road and other campgrounds, finding a level spot, and pitching your tent. You'll have to fill out a form, (get it online at http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10365_108... ) and leave it when you leave so if a Ranger finds your campsite they'll have a record of your stay.\nMany companies that produce timber own vast amounts of land and allow recreational use of their lands while the timber grows. A quick google search should turn up links to companies with these types of programs in your area. Usually this type of camping is free.\nBut if you're moving across the countryside and night is falling, you may have to find a spot on a piece of land and you might not know who owns it. If you camp under these conditions you are \"Stealth Camping\". I've done this all my life and have lots of advice as to how to do it and how to stay out of trouble.\nEither watch the video (above) or read the transcript, (below) but the information is the same. You'll benefit from my experience and hopefully not have to learn the hard way. Once you know how, Stealth Camping offers an amazing feeling of freedom, -and its FREE!\nThere are many reasons people Stealth Camp. I do it because I want the freedom of camping where the night finds me. I don't want to have to reach a specific destination at a certain time, such as a campground or a motel. Stealth Camping fits my style because I use a bicycle to get where I'm going and I'm usually wandering without a tight schedule. Around nightfall I'll start looking for places to SC. I've occasionally had a hard time finding a place that meets my requirements, but usually its surprisingly easy and it turns out I've found some beautiful places to SC. And, here's the best part, there are no campground fees to pay or campground rules to follow.\nThe trick is to not get into any trouble. Trouble could be a charge of trespassing, but I've talked to police about it and if the landowner complains, I could be charged. If the landowner doesn't know I was ever there, and the police don't find me, or find me suspicious, I won't get in any trouble. The police I've spoken with in various locations never knew what SC is. So I'm in the category of under-the-radar, which is how I like to fly, (or pedal).\nIf you're using a car to SC, its much harder. A car is harder than a bike to conceal. A bike is silent. A bike gets you there without having to pay for gas, insurance, the car payment, etc. A bike can lay flat, it can carry all the equipment you need and a few luxuries too. But a car can be a shelter too, easier than pitching a tent, and you can wake up and speed away from some forms of trouble in a car. In a tent you're more vulnerable. I find uncertainty exhilarating, so I prefer a tent.\nIf you do SC with a car, the best way to avoid trouble is to park at a bar or restaurant, grab your gear out of the trunk and quietly walk away to your pre-selected SC camp. Anyone would assume you had another ride home, so your car shouldn't arouse suspicion. Carpool parking lots are a good place too. But bike SC is my favorite because of the feeling of freedom and of being immersed in the outside world.\nWhile on my bike I SC where I like the feel of the place. I'll give you some examples of great places I've found. There was a big storm coming once and I found a forest behind a Home-Depot. It started pouring as I finished setting up my tent and I got inside. I knew it would rain for awhile and it turned out it poured rain for 2 days and nights. I was pinned down except for the fact that I turned on my laptop and discovered the free wi-fi from Home-Depot! I was entertained the whole time.\nOnce I was pushing my bike up a mountain and discovered an abandoned road running parallel to the busy road I was on. I veered off onto the abandoned road and walked a few yards until I found a level place and pitched my tent in the middle of the road. I ended up staying there a couple of nights because I needed time to do some bike maintenance. It was a sweet spot.\nOnce along the Potomac River I was Stealth Camping at nightfall and was rigging a spring pole. A spring pole is a short length of fishing line that you tie to a branch beside the river. Bait the hook and toss it in and come back in the morning to see if you've caught a catfish, which bite all night. But as I was walking away the branch started wiggling and I pulled out a 2 foot long blue catfish. I ate it all and went to sleep with a full belly. I still remember the beautiful feeling of being provided for, having what I need when I need it. That's prosperity.\nI never camp near cities because all the good spots are taken already by the homeless. I'm not against the homeless, but they have problems I don't want to be near. They're territorial, so they won't welcome you setting up camp nearby. You don't want to anyway, because they're not living with their friends because they've worn out their welcome because they're messy or anti-social. They can have substance abuse problems you don't want to involve yourself in.\nI always have a cover story ready in case of a visit from someone during the night. I could explain how my bike broke and I was fixing it til dark, or how my back went out and I had to quit pedaling and lie still because its painful. I never carry a weapon such as a gun, although I do carry a knife but its a fillet knife and I'm a fisherman, so its logical that I would have one, (and it has a long blade). I don't want to have a situation where I'm searched and get charged with carrying a concealed weapon. Carry a gun and they'll think you're hunting on their land or up to no good and dangerous. You don't want to arouse suspicion. I carry my fillet knife in plain sight. I've never had to use it as a weapon. I don't expect trouble.\nThere are poor choices you can make when scouting for a SC site. Near a path where people jog, walk or walk dogs isn't a good choice because someone could see you and report you. A dog may wander, following your scent, and come right to your camp, bringing their curious owner. Not too Stealthy.\nNear a school or place where kids congregate isn't a good choice because people might think you're a pedophile and get nasty. Same with a summer camp. I once stayed at the headquarters of a Coon Hunting Club. Great spot, nobody was there because it wasn't coon season.\nI don't complicate things by building a fire. Its light gives your position away, its smoke makes people wonder if something of theirs is burning and they have to investigate. Its hard to tend a fire and rest from a long day of pedaling. If I'm cold I get in my sleeping bag. I don't like smelling like a campfire when I go into a restaurant. Lots of reasons to forgo a fire when you're SC. They may keep away wild animals, but if that's your concern there are other ways to keep them at bay. That's a topic for another Instructable.\nA great place to SC is land marked by an old for sale sign. There's plenty of places for sale and all but forgotten, owned by developers who've never been there.\nYou can't go wrong when selecting a site to SC if you come across a church that's out in the country. Religious people probably won't come after you with a shotgun.\nAlways keep your camp neat and clean with no litter, no scattered gear, so that the first impression you present to someone discovering your SC is that you're disciplined. Combine this with politeness and a cheerful attitude and you'll be ok. If you're friendly, they will follow your lead.\nAvoid abandoned homes, vandalized buildings, or any place near a prison. Good places are power-line cuts, logging roads, trail heads, and large parks that close at dusk. I once camped in a park along a stream in the desert, some kind of nature preserve that didn't allow camping. I pitched my tent in a thicket and right before dark I heard the Park Staff walk by, doing a final check that everyone had left the park. They missed me. HA!\nTips for avoiding trouble: no contraband, (illegal drugs, weapons, animal traps, fishing gear if you don't have a fishing license, etc). Don't give law enforcement any problems. Smile at them, chat it up if you like. Most folks are nice folks and that includes police and park rangers.\nMy final tip for SC would be don't let anyone see you leaving the road or getting back on the road in the morning. In areas of low population, most people know each other, which means if they don't know you, they're wondering what you're up to. The truth is you're someone on a bike, harmless and friendly and just passing through.\nI put technology to good use. I have cameras, a cellphone, a tablet, batteries and chargers and those things let me share my adventures with the people who watch my videos. (You should subscribe to my Youtube Channel because its free and I have lots of great camping advice and adventures!) With Google Maps I can navigate, scope out the terrain ahead and find really good SC sites. Technology also allows me to get weather reports, information which can be mildly interesting to life-saving. I hope that if I go missing someday my cyber trail can lead rescuers to me or my remains, or at least the footage of the pack of wolves closing in on me. I'd like to go out snarling and viral.\nWith the technology I have seen given unto humanity within my lifetime, and the peace that has descended on the forests of North America, which for centuries were battlegrounds, I realize I have more freedom than anyone who ever roamed this earth.

Without fire you won't be able to boil the water you gathered which is full of bacteria, cook your food, keep warm, feel cosy in the night and scare away predators. Without fire you CAN'T survive. So always bring at least TWO-THREE fire starters. I bring matches and a lighter. You could bring a magnesium block aswell.\n\n2. First aid. You always risk getting cut or get bit by something, so what do you do? First, pack some bandages. You will need them for small cuts and wounds. A good thing to bring is ethanol, you can kill the bacteria off your wound. Get pills like paracetamol for fevers, headaches, etc. Also, if you have allergies (like me) or just to be on the safe side, get a few of anti-allergic pills from pharmacies, you don't want anaphylactic shock after all.\n\nAvoid snakes and don't run if you see one, take light steps and pass it. Look at your feet and avoid tall grass + rocks. If you get bit by a snake tie your shirt tightly just a big higher than the area and go to the nearest hospital or ER. Don't lay or sit down, keep your legs/arms lower than your heart.\n\n3. Sharp tool - Knife.

Food can be gathered by hunting or fishing. I will explain hunting first.\n\nFor hunting, I got a slingshot which you already saw in the other photos. I prefer a slingshot more than a bow & arrow because it's easier to hit and the ammo is free, you can just pick up rocks and spring them to your target. If you are in a situation in which you don't have anything but a knife and some firemaking tools, then read the following:\n\nSometimes, it happens. You don't have much and you need to survive. Well, there are a few options. You could get some rocks and hit your targets with that, either by throwing or smashing them with it. For instance, frogs. But is usually a poor way and unreliable way of hunting, but it still works.\n\nFishing, which is also hunting, lol: For fishing, you can use the safety pins or the paperclips from your kit which you just made, Bend the safety pin or paperclip and tie them onto strong string that you also packed. Then, tie the string to a sturdy, but bendable stick and put a worm or some other kind of live-bait and fish. It's not that hard, and it's efficent. When you use your improvised fishing pole, it's best to be quiet and to not move, or you will scare the fish. Look for signs of your string moving radically or dropping down fast, but don't pull yet. If it starts to really push it down then pull out, but be careful not to do it too fast or it might go off your \"hook\" and escape! Use force, but pull in a steady pace.\n\nFishing melee style: This is an really easy way to do it. It's called spear fishing, and anybody can do it, even if you had no supplies at all. Just find a stick, has to be sturdy but not too big, then you grind one of the ends in a rock until it has a sharp, arrow-like point. You'll get the idea when you actually try it. Then, just go and throw it, or stab the fish with it. You have to be really fast! Can also be used for self defence, walking stick and hunting other animals with it!\n\nI am sorry for the poor way of explaining the technique, but I am a 14 year old boy from Bulgaria.

Having never done an endurance ride like this before, there were a lot of bells a whistles I needed for my bike. Purchasing all this kit on a budget led to me looking for cost-cutting options for everything. For my saddle bag, I was lucky enough to find this: http://www.howtofixbikes.ca/2008/12/how-to-make-real-cheap-hard-saddle-bag.html\n\nLove at first sight! Unfortunatly, after about a month of hard use on the training course, one of the zip ties pulled through the thin plastic of the jar (it's all good, I wanted to \"upgrade\" to a bigger jar anyway). This led to a little design-tweeking, and this instructable.\n\n\nThings you will need:\n- A clean, empty plastic jar.  I'm a fan of the 28oz peanut butter jar, but any plastic jar with a wide mouth and screw-on cap will do.\n- 2 smallish zip-ties or cable ties\n- 4 washers (I used 1/8 x 3/4 fender washers here, but I originally used miss-matched washers and it worked fine)\n- a big nail, awl or small drill\n- a hammer (not necessary if using a drill)\n- duct tape\n- marker\n- Bike in need of a saddle bag\n- reflective tape (optional)\n\nStep 1:\nMake sure your jar will actually fit under your saddle!  Tall people are probably fine here, but I'm pretty short and my seat is pretty low.  You may notice in my photos I actually had to take my rear reflector off (I'll re-mount it later).  You don't want a jar that can't fit between your rear wheel and your saddle, nor one that's so big your legs touch it when you peddle.  On the other hand, it should be big enough to hold things.  The jar in the pictures is actually a smidge too small to hold everything I wanted (spare tube, tire levers, patch kit and multi-tool), but I don't know what you are going for.  Try packing the empty jar once before mounting it, to be sure it works for you.  Again, I recommend 28oz peanut butter jars :-)\n\nStep 2:\nHold your jar under your saddle, against the two metal bars that attach your saddle to the seat post. This is where you will ultimately attach the jar. Use your marker to mark on the jar, where the edges of the bars touch the jar. In total, you will have two sets of two marks. You may need to just mark the outside marks and then eyeball for the inner marks.\n\nStep 3:\nPunch 4 holes in the jar.  You will reduce the chances of the plastic tearing if you can make the holes round, so I advise against using a blade.  I used a big decking nail and gently hammered until it punched through the plastic, then kinda twisted it around in the hole to widen it and smooth it out.  An awl or small drill would probably give you an even tidier result.\n\nStep 4: \nThread in the cable ties and washers.  First insert a cable tie through a washer then into an outer hole, with the female (open) end pointing outward. Inside the jar thread a second washer onto the cable tie, then thread the 'tie through the inner hole on that side.  Your end result should be the cable tie bent in a \"U\" with both ends outside of the jar, one washer flat against the outside of the jar and one flat against the inner surface of the jar.  Pull the cable tie pretty tight so the washers lay flat.  Repeat on the other set of holes, making sure the cable is a mirror of the first, so the female side is facing out on both.\n\nStep 5: \nPlace a rectangle of duct tape on the inside of the jar over each washer.  You don't need a ton of duct tape, just enough to cover the washer and holes on the inside of the jar.  This keeps the washer in place, and stops stuff from catching when you pull your gear in and out of the jar later.  It also stops grit and water from leaking in through the holes.\n\nStep 6:\nMount the jar on your bike.  Thread the ends of the cable ties through your saddle bars, going from inside to outside, and loosely pull them through the female ends of the cable ties. When both sides are set, tighten the cable ties as much as you can.  Load that puppy up and head out!\n\nOptional Things:\nYou can trim of the ends of the cable ties if you don't like having them visible.  I kinda like it.  Also, if you are blocking or had to remove your rear reflector in order to mount the bag, you'll want to slap some reflective tape on the jar to make up for it.  Also if you need to use up a whole jar of peanut butter to do this, this is my favorite peanut butter cookie recipe: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/quick-peanut-butter-cookies/detail.aspx", "title": "Plastic Jar Bike Saddle Bag", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Plastic-Jar-Bike-Saddle-Bag/", "steps": [], "channel": "Bikes"}, {"category": "Outside", "description": "by tonytran2015 (Melbourne, Australia).\nThere is currently wide advocating for the application of the method of finding North direction by \u201cthe bisector line of a horizontal watch\u201d.

A perilous situation may arise as illustrated in the following:\nc/- On a summer solstice day, at latitude +26 degrees, the Sun rises in ENE, travels to a point in South direction at mid-day then sets in WNW. However at night the Moon rises in ENE, may travel to a point in North direction at mid-night then sets in WNW. Note here that the Moon may go to the North while the Sun goes to the South at their highest altitudes and the Moon does not necessarily retrace the path of the Sun 12 hour later, as the proponents of the extension had wished.\nSo users should be even more cautious when guessing the position of the Sun in the sky from the position of the Moon.

You don't have to (and shouldn't) sand very deep, just take the shine off of the paper. \n\nOne fin at a time, you should apply a thick bead of glue along the motor mount as shown (and up inside the fin-lock rings), and a thin bead around the fin (the part of the fin highlighted in purple should be covered in cyanoacrylate). \n\nThen, all you have to do is carefully (but swiftly, ~15 seconds at most) push the fin down into the slot where you put the glue bead, and then snap the fin back down into the fin-lock rings. Make very sure that both the front and back snap into place; part of the purpose in the previous step's dry fit was to make sure both snaps work. you probably don't even need to hold it, since the snaps provide excellent mechanical support; you can go straight on to the next fin. \n\nAfter doing all three fins, you can apply cyanoacrylate as shown to the launch lugs, and push them into their slots. They won't sit flat-because they are flat-bottomed and you are applying them to a round airframe-but just hold them there for a few seconds, until they don't fall back off. A piece of blue tape can also be used to hold them in place. The slots in the airframe actually doa great job of making sure that they align properly, so you don't really have to worry about that. \n\n\nThat's all I cover in this tutorial. You will still need to tie the free shock cord end to the payload bay via the cutoff you installed in step 5, tie the parachute to the shock cord (about 12\" from the payload bay end works well), and drill various vent holes and rivet holes for the nosecone-but these are covered well in the existing instructions, and the vent hole placement and sizing, as well as the nosecone attachment, should be something you calculate based on payload requirements, anyway. That's it!\n\nPainting the plastic nosecone and fins isn't impossible, but requires care. Clean them thoroughly with a damp cloth and soap, and rinse all the soap off with a damp cloth. Then use a plastic primer. FInally, after waiting the appropriate time for a full cure (48 hours for Rustoleum plastic primer), apply a general purpose primer to the entire rocket body, including the fins.

We feed them wild bird seed...Not every day...But it makes the winter go faster for us & for them too...They eat out of our hands...It is thrilling...I noticed they were sitting on the ice...No nests...The swan people said yes, they weren't migrating nor building nests...\n  So I decided to design a nest for them to sit upon in winter months...It can be used as a feeding station- bring it along, lay it on the ground & pour your wild bird seed on top- so when they come over to eat, they warm their feet...I changed my prototype eight times so far, bigger diameters each time, then finally from Sisal rope to Poly & Nylon rope...The Sisal biodegraded too quickly...Also the poly rope floats & is easily washable & reusable...\n  I have been thinking of making the nests heated- which involves a rechargeable portable pocket handwarmer & a conductive fabric so that when you stick the handwarmer into a gap in the nest face up, you lay the silver mesh fabric on top, then the whole nest would get warm...That is just an idea though yet...But more ideas on heating the nest are most welcome...\n  The nest can be strung into the crotch of a tree too, for an eagle or hawk or falcon...You can fill it with straw to make it more comfy...For younger birds you have to weave the rope tighter, no gaps...\n\nMaterials: I used 3/8 inch Twisted Nylon in white to begin with...100 feet total...(it came in bags of 50 feet)...Then I switched to a 500 foot spool of 3/8 inch braided red & white poly rope (which floats)...Trumpeter swans are attracted to the colour red, which is why the wild bird seed we use is called \"Red Ribbon\", because birds see a red ribbon well, if you put it near where there is food...\nI have a 43 inch diameter hula hoop...(I got it custom made on ebay.ca for a reasonable price...Not for weaving, for hula hooping, but when I was designing the nests, I found if I wove freehand, it didn't come out in a nice circle shape- so then I thought of using my hula hoop...That makes it way easier to weave)...\n\nMethod: I use a simple monkey chain knot...I first make one long piece & attach it with spare string to the hula hoop...Then I just weave all through using the same knot, until the nest is all filled- no gaps...It is about 12 hours of lazy weaving with breaks if you are slow like me...It can be done much faster...But I sort of do this when I have gaps of free time...It is not hard to do & enjoyable...\n\nExtras: In one of the last pictures, I put a cup through a disposable dinner tray & stuck that into a gap in the nest...The idea is to have a little bird seed container with a cup of water...This is probably unnecessary, but a thought...You can really just put your wild bird seed on top of the nest & they will eat it like that just fine...When they are done they will sit down on the nest...\n\n\n\nKnotting: Ok, here is a video when I was working with the Sisal rope (1/4 inch)...This was harder to do because Sisal is rough on the hands so you have to wear jersey gloves, plus the sisal is a little messy (the strands come off a bit while you are weaving)...But the video shows well how to loop the rope through the knots you have already made...No matter what rope you use, it is the same technique...Sisal is much cheaper than nylon or poly rope (poly is after sisal in price, then nylon after that...Twisted is cheaper than braided...Poly rope floats...Nylon is very easy on your hands...Sisal biodegrades way too quick for my tastes, but birds like it...You can put straw on top of any nest to make it more nesty...If you leave dangly ropes at the edges it makes it easy to tie the nest into the crotch of a tree, or attach it to a giant rock...)\n\n\n\nIdea: I've been thinking of donating a nest to the Toronto Wildlife Centre to use for their rescue birds...Plus it would help me with any design issues that come up...(what kind of rope is nicest...how birds react to the nest in a tree crotch...cleaning the poly rope nest...durability...) You can do that too with the nests you make...\n\nMission: I think that our earth & waterbirds have been getting the short end of the stick when it comes to habitat...They were here first (pterodactyls), but seem to be last when it comes to city planning...Maybe I am being too negative...I'd like to see people around the world weaving nests for earthbirds & waterbirds, to help them out a bit...So you are free to use this design idea as a springboard...If you'd like to sell your nests, go ahead...If someone can get alot of rope at a very good price you might be able to sell them...But rope can get expensive so really think about it...Cheaper rope is harder to knot so that is a consideration...But by all means, steal this idea...(If you have success please write to me at grove@sent.com, just as a feel good email for me...No commission necessary...)\n\nI added some things after I wrote this, which you can see at our blog at www.grovecanada.ca ...(filled in gaps mostly)\n\nhere is a video of my ameliorating:\n\n\n  Extra Thoughts: Ok, I was looking deeply at the heated blanket (electric) which plugs in to your car lighter with a long cord...I was thinking that would make the blanket nice & toasty for a cold winter night for a Trumpeter Swan...My mum says they are dangerous & maybe I tend to agree...Still, it is a thought for an emergency situation if the Trumpeter swan got too cold & you need to transport to a far away rescue facility...(we have The Toronto Wildlife centre, & the big Veterinary facility in Guelph at the university, but those are a pretty far drive- you could have the nest in your SUV, with the electric blanket plugged into the lighter, & that would warm up the swan during transport...(or you could cause a dumb electrical fire- not sure of this though...anyways just ideas...)\n\nThis nest makes a nice gift for the holidays for the people who have everything...p.s. other animals really like them too! Makes a nice wall hanging if you want to store it that way...) Happy Holidays, Sari\n\nOh: the last picture is a 5 foot Ferrocement outdoor sculpture of a Trumpeter Swan that I made to put in the nesting area...The idea is that the sculpture says: \"This is Trumpeter Swan nesting area & you other predators or nest borrowers should know that- & humans too!\" ...I made the sculpture because TRCA (Toronto Region Conservation Authority) said that I could get permission to put a Trumpeter nest out (on their property) as long as I had a wildlife professional come daily to harass any Canadian geese who might like to sit on the nest...Well, I happen to know it is Federally illegal to harass a Canada goose, so I built the giant sculpture instead...(I suppose that could be my next Instructable, if I find the time...)\n\nUpdate: I discovered this August 2012 that Canadian Tire now carries a heated outdoor pad for a dog...This is a way easier way to heat up a nest in winter than my convoluted try to invent one...I guess the gods of heating up outdoor things heard me & answered my call...So you can just buy an outdoor heating pad & put it under or over a nest in winter...", "title": "How to Make a Trumpeter Swan Nest:", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-make-a-Trumpeter-Swan-Nest/", "steps": [], "channel": "Birding"}, {"category": "Outside", "description": "These are bear claws/ rock climbing claws made out of wood and an old armband.\n\nYou will need:\n3 small sticks\npiece of elastic\narmband\nneedle and thread", "title": "Bear Claws/ Rock Climbing Claws", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/bear-claws-rock-climbing-claws/", "steps": [], "channel": "Climbing"}, {"category": "Outside", "description": "Rigging up a heap of small lures, I found my normal split ring pliers (for larger lures) were just to big and cumbersome for the small split rings and near on useless.

You might need them as a backups if you are away from your main your survival kit. From Wikipedia: mini survival kit is a small survival kit which consists of the most essential outdoor survival tools and supplies which are the hardest to improvise, craft on the spot, or replace. It is intended to be carried on one's person at all times, be appropriate to all environments, and be a comprehensive kit without being too large. Other personal gear will primarily offer additional serviceability and ease of use, but the mini survival kit should provide for the basic needs of a survival situation, followed by self rescue, assistance, or a return to normalcy in optimum situations. Two philosophies surround the preparation of mini survival kits. Some people like to carry a few, relatively large items such as a knife, matches, whistle, emergency food, water bottle, etc. Others prefer a collection of smaller but more comprehensive items such as rubber bands, paper clips, fishing equipment, lashing material, razor blades, etc. The decision of which technique to subscribe to depends on one's physical condition, survival skills, wilderness knowledge, and other factors.", "title": "Mini Survival Kits", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Mini-Survival-kits-1/", "steps": [], "channel": "Survival"}, {"category": "Outside", "description": "", "title": "Paracord Color Pick", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Paracord-Color-Pick/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "- Lighter\n- scraps from difference colors\n- scissors\n-", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOI/ODIC/HV85M3DR/FOIODICHV85M3DR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: What You Need"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Scraps heat the ends, melt together and hang round a loop.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FE7/AAR1/HV85M3C0/FE7AAR1HV85M3C0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6H/UY9I/HV85M3BY/F6HUY9IHV85M3BY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F74/VIYY/HV85M3EA/F74VIYYHV85M3EA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ5/OANE/HV85M3EB/FZ5OANEHV85M3EB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Its Simple"}], "channel": "Knots"}, {"category": "Outside", "description": "Some pals gave us a new mainsail for Solara. That was good, because our old one was stretched out and the leech flapped chronically. The new sail was great, but our mast has a track for brass cars to slide on and this sail didn't have them.\n\nThe privateer knot is the quickest way to tie d-rings or other attachments to a sail.\nZan Armstrong demonstrates how to put grommets on the edge of a sail and tie on cars for a mast track. She uses straps of scrap leather to do the job. Here's the finished knot, front and back views.\n\nIt took us a couple of hours to grommet the sail and tie the cars on this way. The other methods would have probably taken a couple of days. It looks complicated, but after you've done a couple the rest go on really quick.\n\nIn his book \"Sailmaker's Apprentice\", Emeliano Marino says: \"Use heavy, well-oiled latigo leather, cutting an experimental piece to determine the length you need. No not make the slit too close to the end of the leather, and finish all slides equidistant from the sail edge. This is a salty and durable method.\" This is the best sailmaking book I know of.\n\ncontinues the Free Yacht saga begun at How to Get a Free Yacht\n\nHere's the table of contents of the whole saga:\nChapter 1: How to Get a Free Yacht\nChapter 2: Maiden Voyage of the Free Yacht\nChapter 3: Fix Broken Stix and other Trix\nChapter 4: Outboard Motor Mutilates Foot\nChapter 5: It's sinking and it's on Fire.\nChapter 6: How To Give Away a Free Yacht\nChapter 7: Get an Even Better One and Fabulize it.\nChapter 8: Celebrate Freedom\nChapter 9: Technicolor Dreamboat\nChapter 10: Privateer Knot\nChapter 11: Dismasted!\nChapter 12: Kiteboat!\nChapter 13: Mast Raising", "title": "Free Yacht Chapter 10: Privateer Knot", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Privateer-Knot/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Zan skins a leather car seat she found in a dumpster.\nThe leather is good quality, and it's free!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FU1/DD1X/FEG40BR5/FU1DD1XFEG40BR5.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Get Leather"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "This sail doesn't have grommets where we want them.\nIt was made to slide by it's boltrope in a mast slot.\n\nWe're putting grommets every 18\" or so.\nFirst put a piece of wood under the sail and use a punch to make a clean hole.\nThe punch is basically just a pipe with a sharp edge, if you'd like to make one.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOT/EM9A/FEG40BRX/FOTEM9AFEG40BRX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD9/6I28/FEG40BRW/FD96I28FEG40BRW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Grommet the Sail- First Punch Holes"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Put the base of the grommet setting die on something solid.\nPut the bottom part of the grommet on top of it.

When you're not looking for a particular stick it seems like the whole place is made of sticks. A whole forest of them. But just try looking for a certain shape or size.\n\nYou may end up like this person described in the book \"Walden\":\nThere was an artist in the city of Kouroo who was disposed to strive after perfection. One day it came into his mind to make a staff. Having considered that in an imperfect work time is an ingredient, but into a perfect work time does not enter, he said to himself, It shall be perfect in all respects, though I should do nothing else in my life. He proceeded instantly to the forest for wood, being resolved that it should not be made of unsuitable material; and as he searched for and rejected stick after stick, his friends gradually deserted him, for they grew old in their works and died, but he grew not older by a moment. His singleness of purpose and resolution, and his elevated piety, endowed him, without his knowledge, with perennial youth. As he made no compromise with Time, Time kept out of his way, and only sighed at a distance because he could not overcome him. Before he had found a stock in all respects suitable the city of Kouroo was a hoary ruin, and he sat on one of its mounds to peel the stick. Before he had given it the proper shape the dynasty of the Candahars was at an end, and with the point of the stick he wrote the name of the last of that race in the sand, and then resumed his work. By the time he had smoothed and polished the staff Kalpa was no longer the pole-star; and ere he had put on the ferule and the head adorned with precious stones, Brahma had awoke and slumbered many times.\nTo read more about how that situation turned out, search for \"stick\" on this page.

This board has never left my side since I created it resulting in people only recognizing me with my board in tote, hearing the occasional camera click, and being called Sasquatch. Unmistakably though my favorite result from this build is to watch people, kids and adults alike, take one look and smile at the zaniness that is my Foot. It has also provided a great icebreaker when someone sees it and wants to know more or when an older gentleman begins to reminisce about stealing his sisters roller blade wheels to nail onto a 2X4. Its all part of the enjoyment of designing and making you're own board.\n\nFinally, I would like to thank TeacherofTheWays for the detailed instructable on how to get started.\nhttps://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-make-a-Longboard/\nand the city of Louisville, Kentucky for making it worth my while.", "title": "How I Designed and Built My 5 Foot Foot Longboard", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-I-designed-and-built-my-5-foot-Foot-longboard/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The design began to come to fruition once I recognized that a board did not have to be symmetrical. Since I was building this for myself, I knew what it as going to be used for and the asymmetrical design was not going to get in the way. I mainly built this for transportation, I wanted something faster than walking but more transportable than a bike (you will see how transportation became the theme of this board).\n\nSince I knew nothing about long boards at the beginning of this, I did a whole bunch of research and consolidated what I thought  I needed in my little black book (a.k.a. what I do on the weekends). I referenced guides on here as well as the forums of SilverFish Longboarding (http://www.silverfishlongboarding.com/) until I felt comfortable enough to buy my materials.\n\nThe main thing I was looking for was critical dimensions, what would be too long/short and too wide/thin (my main concern) to be considered safe under a force load. Think of your design but removing all the unnecessary parts so you are just left with a rectangle that receives the majority of the force. I saw that 7\" was as narrow as I would venture to go and a large wheel base would offer more road stability; so I had my dimensions but  I still needed my design.\n\nNow I can't tell you what apple had fallen to give me this idea but  my driving concept was to have something recognizable via the silhouette and it resulted in the foot. Being from Kentucky...well yall know how we can be about our shoes, if the weather is nice and the grass is soft, why wear 'em! I'm also left handed and lead with my left foot when riding (regular stance) so that's why the left foot was chosen in particular.\n \nYou can see my other designs I had during the process and I'll post more of my pages of ideas I had afterwards.

I mean why not, my tools were all there and I had a balcony for the sawdust). \n\nI went with 3 layers of Baltic Birch plywood glued with Titebond III and a fiberglass bottom to reinforce it (a great investment).\nWhen you set up the press, whatever concavity you set is what it will be, I thought it might relax a bit when It was done so I went a little more concave than I would have preferred but it was all good in the end. Also, buy more glue than you think you might need because with Titebond III, the glue gets absorbed into the wood and you don't want to run out. Make sure you put down a tarp or something similar to catch the secreted glue so it doesn't get on the tile because it can be a pain to clean up.\n\nSince your board will be a concave rectangle when coming out of the press, it might be difficult for you to freehand a design on so I recommend taping together pieces of paper, getting an outline of your rectangle, then sketching the design to cut out into a stencil guide.\n\nAfter you get your outline, time to get to work. Score your outline with a utility knife, this will prevent the wood from splintering across the board when you cut it with a jigsaw. Depending on your design, you might have to go through multiple tools or maybe just one to get it cut out correctly. I used a jigsaw for the majority of it but had to switch to a Dremel with a cutting bit to get into the toes.\n\nEven if you plan on covering your board with grip tape and paint, you'll still want to sand it to some degree. I stained the top of mine so I went down to a finer grain but you want to round the corners and deburr the wood. Make sure to blow air or take a damp rag to it to clean off the fine dust in preparation for the next step of applying grip tape and fiberglass.\n\nOnce again, there a multitude of guides on both these subjects so I won't delve too far into them but I will give some tips. To the observant, I indeed did not put grip tape on my board. I like the look of the wood and I wasn't too satisfied with the look of clear grip tape so I left it bare. The majority of the time i'm barefoot when riding the board and the skin provides enough resistance so I don't slip off. When I bomb hills I where my vans that stick well enough so I yet to have a strong reason to hide the wood. However, if you go this route, realize the potential danger in doing so and under no circumstances, get the top wet because you will easily slip off.\nTeacherOfTheWays has good instructions for applying fiberglass but I will make one small note...it is a chemical reaction so if say you put the board with the fiberglass outside on a balcony on a chilly November night, it will not set up.\n\nAfter the fiberglass cures, do it with it what you will. Once again, I wanted the theme of this board to be transportation so for the deck, I took a Louisville map and Modpodged it on then took a clear coat spray to the whole thing to seal it in. and make it water resistant. Aside from looking great, I can use the map to find new hills to check out from talking to people.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ9/65PX/HJKC2UBZ/FZ965PXHJKC2UBZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6W/X1ZF/HJKC2SRZ/F6WX1ZFHJKC2SRZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC7/N9D3/HJKC2SS4/FC7N9D3HJKC2SS4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO0/9A5G/HJKC2SZK/FO09A5GHJKC2SZK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1S/JNEL/HJKC2SSF/F1SJNELHJKC2SSF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV7/2TES/HJKC2SSV/FV72TESHJKC2SSV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJG/DYJ5/HJKC2SSZ/FJGDYJ5HJKC2SSZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1D/F3X6/HJKC2STO/F1DF3X6HJKC2STO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWO/6QAP/HJKC2UHL/FWO6QAPHJKC2UHL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Build"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "There you have it guys (or at least I hope you got an idea) how I designed and built my longboard.

We live in an apartment with one small wall mounted air conditioner, and it just can't keep up, at least not without running up the power bill. I've tried a few experiments to see what kind of cooling effects I could add to the living space, but nothing has really panned out as good as I had hoped, and I have wanted to try an evaporative cooler for a while. A few years back I went to school for mech. eng. technology, so it's now time to put it to good use.\nI learned the principles behind hydronic cooling, swamp coolers and chilling towers and the like, at school, so I had a good grasp on it already.

I started with a model of the housing, since that would be the first thing I will build then fit the rest of the parts inside that. I wanted to be able to access the inside of the box while it is still sitting in the window, so the inside grill needs to be removable.\nI found a 110V bath fan at Princess Auto for $5, and a couple of those should do more than enough to move the air. A small pond pump will also move more than enough water for this project, since all you need is to keep the evaporation medium wet, and that keeps everything running on 110V and I can wire the unit to use just one power cord.

You need pretty well stocked metal shop to work with sheet metal, I guess an alternative to bending would be cutting out each flat piece and welding corners together instead of bending them, but as a hobby welder working with thin sheet metal can be difficult.

Drill a hole in a convenient location for your power cord, mine was on the right side near the bottom, but high enough not to interfere with the reservoir.\nAfter cutting the pieces you need to bend them, this is where my pride and joy comes in. I made my sheet metal break for this exact purpose. The bends on the outside of the box are primarily to give the box strength, but also to hold in the screen on the back side, and a screen or air filter on the front.\nTack weld the corners to get your box together, then finish welding everything. After welding the housing I used a grinder on the outside of the welds to smooth out the surface. I also made the reservoir at this time, using a square piece of sheet I bent it into a channel and welded two end caps on. The welds on this have to be water tight so be careful.\nAfter everything was welded and cleaned up with the grinder I needed to paint the whole thing.

I wanted to use fasteners instead of welding onto the housing so that it would be easy to remove all the internal pieces if need be. Make sure you use stainless steel fasteners so you don't have rust issues. I welded angle brackets onto the ends of my fan arms, and drilled corresponding holes in the housing sides to mount them. Paint the ends of the fan mounting arms to keep them from rusting.\nI ended up not using a screen on the outside of the swamp cooler, because, it would be sitting in my window that has a perfectly good screen of it's own, but I did mount the fans far enough away that a screen could be added later.

This also happens in a humidifier in pretty much the same way, so I decided to use a replacement humidifier pad. I found a replacement humidifier pad at Home Depot for $13, so I got 2.\nThis step goes hand in hand with installing, or at least mocking up, the reservoir. I wanted the bottom pad to hang down inside the reservoir so there would be no splashing or dripping from the water falling into the reservoir. The water level will stay below the bottom of the pad, but it is shielded by the reservoir.\nThe pads are layers of expanded aliminum mesh stuck together adding up to about 1.5\" thick. It's easy enough to bore a hole through the pad on the drill press for a screw in each top corner. I measured and marked the inside of the housing for where to mount my brackets, with the fans in place so I knew I had enough clearance. I used some larger angle brackets and threaded one of the holes to receive a 1/4\"-20 machine screw and used that to secure the pad with a long screw and a flat washer. Again, use stainless fasteners.\nNotes: I glued (epoxy) my reservoir on top of a pressure treated 2x6 so that it would be stable but could still be removed from inside the housing. Make sure you account for the 1.5\" difference in height with this set up.\nWhile testing my swamp cooler I left it running for a while and when I came back it was blowing bubbles. It would have been fun if I had a 6 year old, but alas, no such luck. I figured out that the humidifier pads came coated in some sort of oil. It turned the water brown and slick, so I emptied the cooler and washed the the reservoir and pads.

I looked around for a more suitable unit but there was nothing available is stores, being that it is nearing the end of the summer. Because it was nearing the end of the summer, I also didn't want to order another pump online and wait for it to be shipped, so I instead opted for a 12VDC bilge pump I found at Princess Auto. THis meant I would now have to have a power transformer in the cooler.\nI ran some 1/4\"ID tubing up from the pump in the reservoir to the top of the evaporation pad, and made a little manifold with a few 1/4\" fittings to split the water into 3 streams to flow back down to the reservoir. You could do more to try cover more of the pads at the top, but 3 is definitely sufficient.

I always use heat shrink tube when soldering cord connections, especially in this case it keeps the water out, and it just looks nice and clean. The fans had a standard plug on them so they just plug right into the extension cord, but the pump needed a transformer. I have various wall warts kicking around my electronics bin so I used one that was rated at 9VDC and it works perfectly. I soldered the wall wart to the bilge pump and plugged that into the final spot on the cord. I recommend putting a drip loop in the pump cord, with the soldered connection at the top, and the cord drooping down before coming back up to plug into the extension cord.

You should use hardwood whenever water is present because it stands up much better, but I suppose it's not entirely necessary. I had some so I used it. After the frame is made, I laid it face down on some speaker cloth and wrapped it around the back where it was stapled. I made my frame a bit too big so that I could wrap the cloth all the way around the wood piece and this gave the frame a good friction fit over the housing.

Building an igloo is a process that requires a certain amount of artistry, but is less of an energy expenditure than a snow mound shelter. In general, rectangular blocks roughly 24\" by 18\" by 6\" are cut and stacked in an ascending spiral. The rectangular blocks are placed vertically and the bottom shaped so that only the two bottom corners are supporting the block. Then the block is tilted inward and the vertical edge contacting the adjacent block is cut away until the weight of the block rests only on the upper corner. The weight of the block is supported by the diagonally opposite corners, while the third corner prevents rotation. Once the first row is laid you shave off the tops of several blocks ( 1/4 - 1/3 of the circumference) to create a ramp and build upward in a spiral.

In a selected spot, place an upright marker (ski pole, ice axe, etc.) to mark the center. Tie a cord to the marker and scribe a circle in the snow to indicate the pile size. The rule of thumb for size: if the snow in place is not to be dug out, the radius should be the interior size plus about 2 feet; if the snow in place is to be dug out, about 1 foot can be subtracted from the radius for each foot of in-place snow. Piling the snow for a two person shelter will take two people about an hour. Pile loose snow within the marked circle with shovels, tarp etc. Don't compact the snow. When the mound is the right size and shape, do not disturb it; allow it to compact naturally - minimum time one hour. Chances of collapse are greatly reduced if you let it settle for two hours. Thirty-five degrees is the natural angle at which loose snow rests. Be sure to allow the snow to settle at this angle. Otherwise you will have thin spots or a buckling roof when you excavate the interior. After compaction you are ready for digging. The entrance direction should be away from the prevailing incoming weather. From the entrance point start digging toward the marker. Pass the snow out to helpers. As soon as you reach the marker, do no not disturb it. This is your guide for excavating the interior. Clear out the inside to the intended radius. To check on wall and roof thickness, measure with a stick poked through. When the dimensions check, remove the marker and trim the interior. Then install a vent in the roof. Get rid of waste snow promptly before it hardens.

They are very beautiful animals.\n\nRecently, however, we have been seeing a coyote coming near or into our backyard. I feel sorry for coyotes because they and their prey are being crowded out by human \"progress,\" but we can't ignore aggressive animals.\n\nWe worry for the safety of our 2 small dogs. We keep a close eye on them.\n\nOne day my 11 year old granddaughter had a brilliant idea. She created what she calls a \"Coyote Stick.\" When raised and shaken it makes a loud, threatening sound which scares away any coyote. It can also double as a weapon for self protection, if necessary. (Though we feel pretty certain that it won't be necessary.)\n\nThe materials required to build one are minimal. Since most of it comes from things found around the yard and recycle bin,the cost is pennies--a small amount of duct tape is the only real cost. It takes just a couple minutes to put one together and is so simple little kids can do it.\n\n**And before you leave a comment about the dangers of coyotes, we already know. We've lived around them almost 4 years. Both my grandkids have been trained in what to do if they see any wild animal. Back away. Don't run. Don't touch. Get an adult.

It's difficult to explain.

I'm sure by now you're bored with sanding, so let's add a new complication: carcinogens! \n\nThe fins are made of a material called G10/FR4 Garolite. It is a phenolic-resin fiberglass. Sanding fiberglass produces particulates that, depending on their size, can cause cancer or just muck up your respiratory system. That's why it's important that WHENEVER YOU SAND FIBERGLASS, SAND IT UNDER RUNNING WATER. This is called WET-SANDING, and it is a standard safety practice. \n\nYou want to use something a bit finer on G10, probably like a 150-grit, or even a 220-grit sandpaper. First, for your own safety, you want to round the edged of the fins. This is just a splinter-prevention measure, although the rounded smooth edges of the fins add a nice professional touch. Don't try to sharpen the fins; they'll just degrade as it lands repeatedly on the hard desert floor. I tried to capture this process in the first two images. \n\nThen, we want to sand for epoxy bonding. Masking is not necessary but I like it, it looks good.

Using the edge of the popsicle stick, try to shove epoxy down the slots. It is also possible to force epoxy down into the slot by spreading epoxy over the slot and then squishing it with the flat of the popsicle stick tip. In addition, use the flat of the popsicle stick to lay a big, healthy bead of epoxy along the bottom of the fin*; this will also help. Do this for all fins and fin slots. Then, insert all the fins, making sure that they are all the way down against the motor mount. \n\nSorry, but this was a two-handed job, and it wasn't easy to take pictures of. \n\n*spread some epoxy on the flat, lay the flat on the bottom edge of the fin, at a 45 degree angle to the plane of the finn and drag the stick both along the length of the fin and toward you across the fin.

DO this for all fin side-airframe interfaces (sorry XCalibur teams :( )\n\nI have added a white dye of sorts to the epoxy in these images, to make it easier to see. \n\nIf you have masked off the areas around the fillet, you can reap an added benefit in this step. After your fillets are laid but before the epoxy is dry, you can peel the tape off, leaving perfectly-smooth-sided fillets, as shown in the last images. \n\nNote: I made these fillets (well, Carlo Vaccari did, but that's a technicality) with a finger.

Twist the dowel as you do this; it will force the epoxy into whichever corner (fin-airframe or fin-MMT) and make nice curved fillets. \n\nThey don't need to be especially large, mind; if they're there at all, it'll help a lot.

Squeeze out two small beads of JB-weld, one of each part. They should both be about the size of small peas. I mixed WAY TOO MUCH. \n\nSpread the JB weld smoothly around the exposed MMT, as shown. Take the HAMR (with the actual knurled ring on) and slide it on over the epoxy (you can put some more epoxy in the HAMR as well, where it touches the MMT). Again, a twisting motion will spread the epoxy evenly. It should fit up against the aft CR.

It is important to clean these off now, as the JB weld dries very hard and will be difficult ot remove later. DO NOT SMEAR IT AROUND TRYING TO REMOVE IT.

This is how to make one from a rail road spike (which can be found along any rail road track).\nWATCH FOR EXAMPLE - This will give you an idea of what can be done. (I disagree with the ropedart being called a 'little brother' - it is designed for penetration, not blunt force trauma as is the meteor hammer.)\n~There are stories of these passing through solid oak doors.\n~The blunt side can be swung with enough power to crack skulls.\n~The cord can be used to entangle and bind.\n~With skill, the dart can change directions mid-flight, appearing eratic to the opponent.\n~It is easily concealed.\n~It is stunning to see one in use.\n\n\"As folklore goes, this weapon was first used by Du Mu, a general in the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-24).

So I had to work all weekend non-stop, to get to this. This of course is not the final version, but it\u00b4s like the base or concept . And I think that you can realize the final version inside of this \"prototype\".\n\nThe basic idea was to build a recumbent trike, with a cargo place and a home/bed way, plus having the possibility of LIGHT MOVILITY with a DETACHABLE NORMAL BIKE. I find very usefull the thing of leaving a normal frame to detach so you can move to any place easier  without all the cargo.\n\nThe ugly pipes, and the poor joints are just too put them togheter, everithing will be cleaner and off course safer. ( I would not ride this thing like this not even crazy ) Also the bed won\u00b4t be this bed, I will do a very light but strong structure for it. So I can sleep inside and also travell with my things.\n\nFor this I used 3 old bikes I had, one of my grandfather, one finded in the junk and one for $15, used an old bed, and some junk I had in my place. Had to buy some smaller things, but this was more for the hurry of being able to arrive to the final date of the content ( wich is today).\n\nComents are always welcomed, and if you would vote for this proyect I guarante I\u00b4ll post a PART 2, with all of the improvements, plus riding videos.\n\nHave many ideas in my head, but do not have the time to put them all in here. Like a rear traction for both wheels an aerodinamical shape, and a hanging seat.\n\nWish you find this interesting, sorry for any mistake or for my not too good english.  Hope to win some price, saw some of the products of  REI and they have cool things, and the Monkeylectric Monkey Lights looks amaizing.

So much so, the small cages sold in stores are all but worthless.\nYears ago, I made my own cages from fencing I had on hand. The fencing was about for feet tall and the openings were all about six inches square. The fencing made perfect cages for the huge plants that grew in truck tires, from which I'd removed all but a couple inches of the upper sidewall.\nI found myself needing large cages again, but all the \"perfect\" fencing, like I'd used, required I buy a large, expensive roll. However, while wandering one of the big box stores, I did come across a roll of fencing three foot tall and about fifty feet long for around $30.00.\nThough the recently found fencing had holes too small to reach through [and pull out large tomatoes], the holes can be enlarged at random points about the finished cage to make accessing the plant and its fruit easy.\nTo build these cages, you'll need:\n1) Fencing (available from big box stores, hardware stores, garden supplies, etc.).\n2) Wire cutters large enough to cut the wire, side cutters or a small bolt cutter.\n3) Two pair of pliers\nor\n3) A pair of pliers and channel locks\nor\n3) A pair of pliers and the side cutters used to cut the wire.", "title": "Tomato Cages for Large Tomato Plants", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Tomato-Cages-for-Large-Tomato-Plants/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Whether your pot is round or square, you need to determine how big to make your tomato cage.\n[SQUARE POT]\n1) If your plants will be grown in a square pot with, for example, a pot with 20\" sides, your cage needs to be a little less than twenty inches on a side to fit in the pot.\n2) If your pot is twenty inches, you need to measure twenty inches for each of the four sides (4 x 20\"), then subtract an inch for each side (80\" - 4\" = 76\").\n3) When cutting the individual wires, leave about 3/4\" beyond any piece of wire ninety degrees to the wire being cut. This is necessary for securing the two ends. It will be used to rap around the other end.\nor\n[ROUND POT]\n1) If your cage will be used in a round pot, you must determine the circumference of the pot. To do this:\na) Find the diameter of the opening of your pot. To do this, measure across it. This can be done by holding the end of the tape measure at one point on the pot, then pivoting the opposite end of the tape off that point, until you get the maximum reading for the opening.\nNOTE: Because the cage must be smaller than the opening of the pot, you can reduce the diameter by \"burning\" the first two inches on the tape to, essentially, remove an inch off the perimeter. That is, instead of using the end of the tape for your pivot point, use the two inch mark as your starting point. Alternately, you can just subtract two inches from the diameter.\nb) Multiply the diameter by pi (3.14). So, if you arrived at a diameter of twenty-four inches (24\"), you would multiply that by three point fourteen for a result of seventy-five point thirty-six inches (75.36\").\n2) Once you have your measurement, layout your fencing and cut it to the length your came up with for your growing pot or area. You MUST leave approximately three quarters of an inch (3/4\") of wire sticking out from the squares near where you are cutting. You will need the wire to tie the ends together.

Use the pliers or channel locks to wrap the wire until no sharp edge is sticking out.\n3) Flip the fence over and do the other end, then work your way back to the first. Again, bend the wire until no sharp protrusions extend where they could cut or scratch you.\n\nNOTE: If you find the 3/4\" length you left when cutting the length, you can cut off a little more, but leave enough to get a complete wrap around the wire you are tying to.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: Tying the Ends of the Cage Together"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Choose random points around the cage for your enlarged openings.

So what is a tube\nsparkler and why make one. I think it is safe to say that everyone who is reading or read this instructable has played with or seen a sparkler. basically a tube sparkler is a hand held firework that burns slowly and produces sparks due to a powdered metal. i know some people might say \"why make a sparkler when you can buy them at the shops for under $2\" well firstly the ones you buy at the shops are one of two main groups of sparklers dipped sparklers and tube sparklers in this instructable we are making a tube sparkler as they can contain more composition and therefore give off more sparks. secondly shop bought are dimmer and give off tiny sparks that die as fast as they begin. So that's why i have created my own\nnow before I continue i have to make sure that you know this. These sparklers are more powerful than normal sparklers and create a lot more sparks that are hot and can stay lit for over a second when they have touched the ground so do not light this sparkler when your standing on a pile of dry leaves or any other flammable material if you step on the sparks in bare feet you might receive a small but nasty burn so wear shoes and never point it at anyone. People watching the show should stand at least 3 meters away. So remember to be safe and think before lighting and you will have a great time.\nOK i'm glad i got that off my chest so where did I get the idea to make a tube sparkler. Well the idea to make this tube sparkler came when i stumbled on a great pyrotechnic composition that produced an immense amount of sparks and light ,which i will show you how to make later on, after thinking of many things i could use this mixture for i came up with a simple yet effective and bright sparkler.The sparkler was made at home using chemicals that aren't hard to find or buy and some tools that most house holds should have.", "title": "Bright Tube Sparklers", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Bright-Tube-Sparklers/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "take out your notepad and make a shopping list because this is what you need\n# potassium nitrate/KNO3\nIn the sparkler composition the potassium nitrate will oxidize the reaction. with out it the reaction wouldn't get any oxygen and therefore would not burn\n#sulphur\nIn the reaction sulphur will act as a fuel for the potassium nitrate to oxdize\n#charcoal/carbon\nIn the reaction charcoal like sulphur will act as fuel\n#aluminium powder mesh 400\naluminium powder is our main chemical and will give the reaction its brightness and sparks\n\nNow these are the tools you'll need you should already have most of them but if not there not hard to find \n# Mortar and pestle\nfor grinding chemicals\n#pencil \nfor mixing chemicals and for making the tube to contain our sparkler composition\n#paper\nfor making the tube and a funnel to put the sparkler composition in the tube\n#digital scale\nfor measuring chemicals\n#medicine cup \nthis is a good thing to measure your chemicals in\n\nExtra Stuff\nA pole or a long piece of heavy wire to mount the sparkler on a glue stick for making the tube some masking tape or string to attach the sparkler to the top of pole or wire and a spoon for scooping chemicals. i did not include these in my photo as there need became obvious after the photos were taken.

The circuit from Bike Generator needs to be changed slightly though. For instructions on how I put together the circuit refer to Bike Generator. For BikeGen I wanted to be able to recharge batteries while I rode and then use those batteries to power both the headlight and tail light. I wanted a good charge controller as well so that the batteries would not be over charged. I looked at a few charge controller kits that you solder together be decided to hack something instead. So I found thisAA Car Charger on ebay and was able to get it shipped for less than $7. This charger has a 1amp charge rate and can charge two AA's in two hours in a car. It also has a trickle charge feature that maintains full battery charge. This is perfect for what I wanted. Also because I was going to output 12volts I got a car power outlet so that I could recharge my cell phone as well.\n\nThe variable voltage regulator needs to be set up to output roughly 12 volts. Here is all the information you'll need on the voltage regulator LM317 Voltage Calculator I chose to shoot for 13.75volts, because I have measured the power outlet in my car and its usually over 12 volts. Also I could reuse the 220ohm resistor for 13.75volts. The original 220ohm resistor needs to be desoldered and then placed in the same location as the 150ohm resistor. The 2200ohm resistor can then be soldered in the place of the 220ohm resistor. I then used a dremel to spin the motor to make sure the regulator was working right. It output 13.88volts which was right on the money.\n\nSo the original Bike Generator circuit will rectify the AC power from the motor and regulate the voltage to 13.75volts. That power will then be fed to the charger circuit. The charger is then connected to a DPDT switch which is used to switch the batteries form the charger to the lights.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FR2/HW2C/FPBKZIJ1/FR2HW2CFPBKZIJ1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQN/QU79/FPBKZIJ0/FQNQU79FPBKZIJ0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLR/CN9C/FPBKZIIY/FLRCN9CFPBKZIIY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3P/72T0/FPIOLHT4/F3P72T0FPIOLHT4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTZ/W8E7/FPIOLHT3/FTZW8E7FPIOLHT3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEC/A2GQ/FPIOLHT2/FECA2GQFPIOLHT2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F86/61NL/FPIOLHT1/F8661NLFPIOLHT1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX8/8MJV/FPIOLHWW/FX88MJVFPIOLHWW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7L/N3U6/FPIOLHWI/F7LN3U6FPIOLHWI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFE/HPMX/FPIOLI2B/FFEHPMXFPIOLI2B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLW/VR7K/FPIOLI22/FLWVR7KFPIOLI22.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F01/CZF5/FPIOLI20/F01CZF5FPIOLI20.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F21/G057/FPIOLI1Z/F21G057FPIOLI1Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO2/P54Z/FPIOLI1Y/FO2P54ZFPIOLI1Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCM/4P23/FPIOLI1X/FCM4P23FPIOLI1X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXT/Y32M/FPIOLID5/FXTY32MFPIOLID5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVD/9JDS/FPIOLID2/FVD9JDSFPIOLID2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Wire the Electronics"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The motor mount should be easy to mount, but I haven't figured out the best way to mount the electronics yet so for right now their just duct taped to the handle bars.

Be careful not to damage the handle on the top of the lid as you drill.\nCut the rod to allow it to extend from near the bottom of the pot up through the hole and leave enough sticking out to thread a nut onto and sandwich the lid between two nuts at the very end of the threaded rod. Do this before you cut the wire mesh pieces so that you can use the lid for a pattern.\nSlip the mesh down over the rod and use the shears to cut the mesh about 1/4\" larger than the overall diameter of the lid. The actual dimension is not too critical, just try to keep it round.\nCut 3 or 4 mesh circles for racks, depending on how many racks you decide to use (use the number that will still allow enough room between racks to easily load food). The bottom rack will be at the very bottom of the threaded rod and then, depending on how tall your stock pot is, you may have 3-5 drying racks.\nPlace each circle of mesh back on the rod, being sure you have it in the center and use your pliers to bend the wire up at a 90 degree angle. Be SURE that you bend it so that it will clear the sides of the pot and slide inside. Once you are sure it fits (test each one as there may be rivets inside for the pot's handles), remove it from the rod and use a hammer or step on the wire to bend it back over. This moves the sharp ends of the wires to face to the inside and gives some more strength to the wire racks. Be careful to be sure the bend is where you started the 90 degree bend or the rack might not fit into the pot.

What is that? you say. Well, I just made it up. I gave myself 30 minutes in a thrift shop with five bucks. Then I got 30 minutes to build a legitimate survival tool that would have cost me at least $30 in a retail store. What I came up with was a heavy-duty, multi-purpose survival knife.

There are several reasons, the first being that looting is not yet socially acceptable. Second, I've become something of a minimalist and I couldn't find anything of my own that I was willing to destroy. Third, the last time I \"borrowed\" something from a friend (I was house-sitting), I had a minor Instructables riot on my hands. People were all like, \"Ooh, you're a horrible friend!\" and \"Man, it's illegal to transform someone else's tennis racket into an atlatl!\" and blah, blah, blah. To avoid the headache -- and yes, I had already dismantled everything at that house that I could repurpose -- I went to a thrift store. HAPPY?!?!? And besides, thrift shops are full of stuff that people pretty much threw away, so it's a representative sample of post-apocalyptic-ish stuff.\nAnyway, if you're satisfied with my explanation, I'll continue. I found a pair of shears at the thrift shop for $2.99, except it was half-off-orange-colored-tags day, so they were really only one dollar and 49.5 cents. I've included a picture with the price tag, so you'll know I'm not lying, at least about the original price. You'll have to trust me on the half-off sale. Also, let me just say to all the retail clerks out there, don't ask people if they qualify for the senior discount. It's really presumptuous and rude! Not that there's anything wrong with senior citizens, but it's a good 20 years before I qualify for your discount, so why risk insulting me? Especially when I was thinking that you were cute and I might ask for your number! How do I recover from that? \"Uh, no, I'm not a senior citizen, but would you like to go out? I might be able to con a discount at Luby's cafeteria.\" ??? And the lady in front me me? She had to be like 119! You kept asking her over and over again if she qualified for the senior discount when OBVIOUSLY she did, and the fact that she kept saying, \"I'm sorry sweetie, I can't hear you,\" despite the fact that you were basically screaming should have been a clue. So, my point is that if I wanted to wait another 20 years, I could have gotten this thing for around a buck twenty five. Life is short, though, so here we go.\nI don't know what these things were originally for. When they were all taped up, I assumed they were for cutting branches or something. Once the tape came off, I started to wonder if they were for gutting a turkey maybe. I don't know. Maybe I should have just kept them, as they would have been handy in the end-times as-is, but that wouldn't make for a very good instructable (not that this does, LOL). So anyway, I got these shear things for $1.495.

My dad called them channel locks, so that's obviously the right term.\nI suppose you could use vice grips or a crescent wrench, but a pipe wrench wouldn't work and in my case, sockets wouldn't fit either, because it was some weird kind of proprietary bolt.

If you're a complete idiot, this is where you'll mess things up. First, pick one side of the disassembled scissors-like thing that you LIKE. If you're prone to confusion, you might want to grab a Sharpie and write \"I LIKE THIS ONE\" on it. Like me, you can select the side that looks like a knife. If you fancy yourself a modern-day Ninja or play too much Call of Duty, you might choose the karambit-esque side. Either way, take the side that you LIKE and set it aside. Put it in a drawer or something until all cutting and grinding is done. That's right, cutting and grinding. Do I have your attention now?\nNow take the side that you DON'T like. No, wait, that sounds too negative. Take the side that you like second best and cut off the blade. DO NOT cut off the bolt hole like some moron because then you've gone and ruined everything. Look at the picture above and see where I cut off my second favorite blade. I used a cutting wheel on a grinder, but you can use whatever you want. Did you ever see the original movie \"Django\"? Not the one by Q.T. (which is flippin' awesome), but the 1966 version starring Franco Nero, whose audition apparently consisted of him wandering in and saying \"Hey, I look vaguely like Clint Eastwood, who's big right now\" (except in Italian). Anyway, I won't bore you with details about the spaghetti Western plot (or lack thereof) that puts Italian Clint smack between a gang of banditos on one side and the local KKK chapter on the other. Suffice it to say that he gets his gun hand mangled through some unsafe horsemanship, thus preventing him from using the Gatling gun that he generally drags around in a coffin. In the climactic movie-ending gun battle, Django is pinned down in a cemetery, armed only with his trusty six-shooter, but he can't fit his bandaged finger through the trigger guard. Personally, I would have used my teeth to get the bandages off, but then again, I'm not an badass Italiano gunslinging loner who nonetheless can't abandon the quiet town in need of his help. No, Django used his teeth to chew the trigger guard off his pistol, thus allowing him to win the day against insurmountable odds. No, that's not a typo. He chewed the trigger guard off his pistol. My point is that if you don't have a grinder or Dremel tool or hack saw, you can chew your second favorite blade off. Spit.

Just put the ^#$*($)! thing together again.\nI put some little notes in the picture above. If everything works out, you should be able to hover over the photo (with your cursor; unless you're David Blaine, I know you can't levitate) and my words will magically pop up. Long story short, there are a few built-in goodies here, in addition to the obvious blade. First off, there are two little pokey, nubby things in the handle. I have no idea what these originally did. Probably nothing. Who cares? Now you can use them to crack open walnuts or maybe torture someone. When I was a kid, we tried going to a church for awhile. The boys got separated out to talk with a leader. Luckily, we weren't molested or anything, but I remember one Sunday this guy had a plan to teach us about the sacrifice that Jesus endured, so he asked for volunteer. Guess who stood up. He whipped out a pair of pliers and got a grip on my thumb. He said he was going to squeeze slowly until I couldn't take it any more and asked him to stop. Like an idiot, he gave us the punch line ahead of time. He was going to show that people are weak and can't take much suffering but that Jesus was all like, \"Yeah, bring it on!\" So I decided that I wasn't going to quit, even if he broke my thumb, after which I'd be able to sue or blackmail him or something. She he squeezed and squeezed and I went to my happy place. Eventually, he gave up and was all pissed off that his plan hadn't worked. That was the last Sunday school I went to. Anyway, my point here is that these little nubby protrusions would be much better for torturing small children than a plain old pair of pliers. (He was using slip-joint pliers, BTdub, not channel locks, which probably would have made me cry).\nSecond, you can slip your fingers through the handle and grip one side. This effectively turns the knife handle into a pair of brass knuckles, perfect for punching some sadistic Sunday school teacher in the face.\nThird, there's a little knob at the base of the handle and this could be used to crack skulls or windows.\nNow, if you're a quitter, you can stop here. You've got a good, sharp, functional knife, made with quality steel. It cost you (and by you, I mean me) less than a buck fifty.

Depending on how you wrap the handle, you can stow things in the cavity. I think that's pretty cool, man! I did some experimenting and I found that you can fit a tube of epoxy, a AA battery, or a tail light bulb from a 1986 Avion travel trailer in there. It's a squeeze, but you can also put your second favorite blade in the handle. The possibilities are endless! Okay, well, not endless, as they're somewhat constricted by the size of the cavity. That reminds me of the time I was in Hawaii and I dove head-first into a lava tube that went into the ocean. I watched another guy do it. He was above 5'2\" and I'm 6'6\", but that didn't seem relevant at the time. He said I should wait for the wave-generated geyser to shoot way up in the air and fall down before I dove in. That way, the suction from the receding tide would zip me through the tube and safely out to sea. Seemed like a good idea at the time, so I waited for the geyser to shoot up. I waited for the geyser to drop down. I dove into the bowels of the earth and was rocketing along quite nicely until my head slammed into a lava bump in the ceiling and I came to a dead stop. The water slowed and there was no movement. My arms were pinned down to my sides. I regained my wits just as the tidal surge started back inland, pushing me in reverse! Time slowed down and I considered my options, one of which was apparently to get shot 50 feet up in the air, feet first. This didn't seem like a good idea, so I clawed at the tube's walls with my fingers and toes and weathered the gale-force current to the face for what seemed an eternity. Then calm.

Picture #2 shows some of the other tubing salvaged from other furniture and hockey nets, etc that gets discarded.  The third picture shows the adjustable connector that was fabricated from other junk on hand, the offsets in the arms were bent  in the vise with short lengths of angle irons (bed rails). If you place them opposite and offset leaving a small space for the offset in your arm, squeezing your arm material  will   form  the offset..  There is welding on this project which may not be available to all, so there is an alternate \"no-weld\" method too.  Keep your eye out for tubing in the 5/8 to 3/4\" diameter range  that  slip fits together.  With short lengths of tubing inside the main frame, you can make a firm connection of the two pieces with (three) drywall screws on each side. No not those, but the small, tough,  short, self drilling types (picture #4)  that are used in the assembly of metal studs, look in the dry wall section for these. Picture #5 shows their use in attaching a trailer hitch to the rear of that carrier. The front  connector can be fitted to the carrier using a short piece of angle iron rather than that welded tab, that  I used. The rear struts were arms from a plant stand, the ends flattened and drilled.   So......there you are, keep your eyes open for scrap material you can get for free and turn into something useful....much better than that wooden types I see out there.

There are some roads you cannot avoid without going miles out of the way, but there is a great deal of roads that can be changed.\n\nThe route we chose, as not by any means the shortest. There were certain places/things/people we wanted to see on the way. Our trip ended up at 1004 miles, but you can do it i around 900 miles if you wanted.\n\nWe decided to complete the ride in 12 days, roughly 80 miles a day. This isn't by any means a massive distance per day, but when you're doing it day in day out, sleeping in a tent, and cooking all your meals; it's certainly enough!\n\nI started my planning with an A2 map of the UK, i drew a line down the middle of what looked like the best route, divided it into 12 different point, and then found campsites near each of those points. I then went onto google maps and found each individual route, making use of street view to see what the road conditions were like when it seemed we would be on that road for a long time.\n\nI've linked up the route cards we made and used, to give you an idea of what you can do.

So the next problem was, what do we take? It was a case of ultralight camping. So here is a list of the things we took:\n\n3 man tent - split between the three of us\nSleeping bag - the smallest one i could find\nRoll mat - I used an ordinary foam one, but my friend used one of those fancy new inflating ones which looked quite cool\nTravelling towel\n2 pairs cycling tops - wash one, wear one\n2 pairs cycling shorts\n2 pairs of socks\n2 pairs underwear\nLong fingered gloves (for scotland)\nHalf fingered gloves\nThermal top\nThermal leg tights things\nCooking stove\nGas\nPots, pans\nPlate\nCup\nInsect Repellant (Midges in scotland are terrible)\nCycling shoes\nFlip flops -  no room for real shoes :(\n2 Spare inner tubes - you can pick up more on the way\nTyre levers\nAllen keys\nPuncture repair patches\nPump\n3 water bottles - two on bike, one in front bag\nFront and back lights (can be used at campsite too)\n\nWow, that's a lot of stuff to put on my poor bike.\n\nI used a rear pannier rack, with panniers. I used a net bungee to strap the sleeping bag and sleeping mat to the panniers. Put them both in waterproof bags/bin liners.\n\nWATERPROOF EVERYTHING, turning up at a campsite with soggy clothes, and wet spares is not a nice sensation, TRUST ME!\n\nIts also really good idea to waterproof everything overnight in the tent as everything tends to get a bit damp then too. \n\nI would suggest investing in some dry bags, I wish i did!\n\nBike maintenance was done mainly by ourselves, we all new how to repair punctures and stuff. We did have a case were one of my friends rear wheel spokes broke, but luckily it lasted to the nearest bike shop!\n\nNutrition is REALLY important, we were eating well over 6000 calories per day! After all, we where cycling roughly 8 hours a day.\n\n6000calories x 12 days / 1000 miles makes about 72 calories a mile - that's about half a banana every mile!\n\nKeeping hydrated is even more important. You need to be constantly drinking throughout the day. Fill up your bottles whenever possible.\n\nOne last note: Saddle Sore!\nThere is no point avoiding the subject - sooner or later it'll hit you. Constant movement of your legs creates rubbing, and once the rubbing starts it will only get worse. The best way to combat it, is to never let it rub. I used vaseline during the day, plaster it on. And in the evenings once i'd showered I used E45 cream.

The \"sidecar\" wheel is a 20 inch super-duper 48 spoke, triple wall rim BMX wheel and has V brakes.\n The power assist is a 24 volt 3/4 hp gearmotor from an old floor scrubber I got to take home from work. 165 rpm was nice for using bicycle chain and sprockets I had laying around.  Motor speed is controlled by 40 amp 24 volt motor speed controller and twist throttle. The cycleanalyst lets me keep an eye on the watts, amps, amp/hours, volts, and speed in real time. And at the end of the trip I can check the watt-hour-miles.\nTwo 55ah AGM batteries power all that plus nice bright LEDs inside of vintage bike lights.\n Most of the cables and wires are threaded through the frame tubes.\n \n It has more than met my needs of hauling my family and goods on local trips or my self to work when I am late or lazy. So far the top speed is barely over 20 mph (flying solo), which is fast for something big, heavy and lacking suspension. \n  The most I have carried at once is three adults, two kids, a toddler and a dog. With that load the top speed was barely over 12 mph, which seems to be the sweet cruising speed.\n Having five gears to choose from on the powered wheel makes it quite versatile. It is nice to be able to carry people and or whatever at a relaxed cruising speed, or go faster with a lighter load and still keep the watt meter under a thousand.

You need to output your file, usually some \".dxf\" file.\nI got my design the way I wanted it and then upscaled it so I could have two sizes and sent it off to be cut.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3O/L38M/ILV81LK0/F3OL38MILV81LK0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9A/OJC4/ILV81LKU/F9AOJC4ILV81LKU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9Q/9QHR/ILV81LLI/F9Q9QHRILV81LLI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Sketchup."}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Part Three: First I contacted BigBlueSaw and had them waterjet cut my design. It was a learning experience. I ordered 10 and it was around $150.\nWhen you send off your files... ask the experts that are going to cut it. This is particularly important if your parts need to fit inside each other... like mine do.\nCut inside the line?\nCut on the line?\nCut outside the line?\nPeople at BigBlueSaw are great and will answer all your dumb questions.\nI cut on the inside of my line... against their recommendations. I tried to out-think them and it didn't work. So just understand that you might screw up a couple jobs, your will screw up a couple jobs! I call it tuition and you need it to get everything right in the end. Don't jump into the final run or 100 or 1000. If you figure your first couple runs are going to be trash... then you are all good.\nIf you get it right... make sure they tell you what they did so you can do it again!\nJust because it worked once, doesn't mean it will work the same way the next time. I did three jobs at one place, they screwed up five times. Even when you get it all set and you like the results... keep on top of it.\nAll three of these cost different amounts so shop around:\nWaterjet cutting is easy, simple and cost effective. The problem I had was the thickness of the cut and the edge it created. It created a razor sharp edge, very sharp. They can tumble them to knock the edges off...\nCNC cutting I couldn't do because the pieces were to small and it just wouldn't work.\nLaser is very precise and worked the best, the edges are nice and straight and somewhat smooth. There is an issue with cutting inside the line, outside the line and one the line, just like waterjet cutting. I worked with a local company that had a rather steep learning curve (for me and them). Now things are pretty good. I also discovered media tumbling the parts after they are cut makes everything smooth and rounded.\nWaterjet Image from: http://www.eastbaywaterjet.com/\nLaser Image from: http://www.msplaser.com/services/laser-cutting/\nCNC Image from: http://www.wired.com/tag/cnc-mill/", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRP/ITQ9/ILWL845E/FRPITQ9ILWL845E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ4/Q0BU/ILWL845W/FJ4Q0BUILWL845W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7D/H36R/ILWL845L/F7DH36RILWL845L.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: CNC Cutting"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Part Four: There are lots of things to know about Kickstarter. There are lots of tutorials... this is just a couple tips for people considering it.\nThe mostimportant thing is you need a really good story and a great video. Many people overlook the importance of a good video. If you show it to ten people and they all love it... ask a kid, under 10 years old, to watch it. If they like it you are heading in the right direction. People spend money on their Kickstarter campaigns, lots of money. It makes the process of crowdfunding unfair for the average person. If you want to do it yourself, great. But if you know anyone who is into videos, have them do it, or help.\nThe second thing and maybe more important is... most Kickstarter projects fail for some reason... that's okay.\nThe biggest issue isn't not meeting your funding goals, it's making your goal! When things work and you get funded, that's when things get complicated....\nHere is my Kickstarter if you are interested. Here are some tips... this is just quick.\nPeople will contact you with offers, many offers, they will promote your campaign and make it a great success. Most will take a percentage of your funding... some want a fee... All in all it's not worth it. Most are scams. Some are real. Not really worth it.\nKickstarter doesn't communicate well, they don't give enough support and it's all up to you when things start to get... tricky. Have a plan for things going wrong. Because something will.\nWhen you get your funding... that takes 30 days... Kickstarter takes roughly 8%. This is just an FYI\nDepending on what you are offering as rewards, you could have lots of shipping. This can make or break you. Shipping cost more than you think. I was meticulous with my calculations... but I still had lots of issues. Whatever you figure for shipping, double it to be safe.\nShipping out of the US is more expensive than you think... just know this.\nCommunicate your wins and your failures with backers, it makes things go so much better.\nPeople like stickers. They are a relatively cheap little bonus for your backers.

A small bike requires less brake cable length, and therefore less cable casing as well. This step will go through what needs to be done to cut the cable casing down to size.\nYou will need (First picture):\n- A saw;\n- A hole punching device or a philips screwdriver;\n- A brake cable casing and brake cable.\nThe cable and the casing on the BMX that I put is black. The one in the picture is one I have for another bike, but you should understand the process regardless.\nTo get down to business you will first need to measure what length of casing you will need. I eyeballed it by putting one end in the brake lever and running the casing along the frame before moving the handlebar around in order to see if the cable was long enough when fully turned. You will also need to cut the cable itself off at the end that would go into the brake side of the mechanism in order for the cable to flow through the casing once cut down to size.\nIMPORTANT: the cable itself needs to be longer than the casing seeing as it has to come out the other end and go through the brake mechanism.\nThis is when I cut the cable casing down to size with the saw.\nIMPORTANT: When you cut the casing you will be applying pressure onto the casing and it will press down the walls a little bit and make the edges jagged. Both of which aren't good for the brake cable. (Third picture)\nThat is why you come in with your hole punch or philips screwdriver to widen the end and allow the brake cable to flow through freely (Fourth picture).\nNow, the cable may have frayed a little bit when you cut your cable originally (Fifth picture), but not to worry. By twisting the cable against the direction in which the cable strands are pointing, the cable will go through the casing and come out the other side.\nLast, but not least! When comes time to put the cable through the casing when you are about to install this all on the bike, and everything is in place, put some oil into the casing, by applying some directly to the cable before flowing it through the casing all the way to the other end. This will ensure that the cable will move around nicely and not get caught or pinched in a dry spot when you really need it that one time you are playing chicken with a tree!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZF/OH59/IDH7OPAL/FZFOH59IDH7OPAL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F45/2FZE/IDH7OPD5/F452FZEIDH7OPD5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLA/KRTZ/IDH7OPFW/FLAKRTZIDH7OPFW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5L/1I5J/IDH7OPIE/F5L1I5JIDH7OPIE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUY/4DDE/IDH7OPF5/FUY4DDEIDH7OPF5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEH/WY3I/IDH7OPJ0/FEHWY3IIDH7OPJ0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Cutting the Brake Cable Casing to Size"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Right after finishing all of this, I took this beauty on a test run.\nAnd boy, does it ever make every unhealthy bike noise ever!\nThe bearings all over need some TLC, some grease and some tightening, but that will come another day...\nThis instructable will probably be amended with some new steps for the details of what I did to the bike, but all in all this is the just of it.\nThis is my first instructable so I would love to know what else should be put into it!\nI have some ideas that will come at a later date...

A VERY COOL bike but no match for the Schwinn. Truth be told, it weighed more than Johnny, even when he had his usual pound and a half of pomade on his plebian ducktail. He developed legs like Popeye's arms.\n\nOK, there's lots of old farts who are \"into\" the old bike hobby, and most of them worship horn tanks, springers, and authentic shiny paint and proper pinstriping patterns. Then there's the Whizzer subculture, devoted to those cruisers from the '40s and '50s which were powered by the legendary 148cc valve-in-head motor conversion of that name.\n\nThis bicycle--based on found junk and an April 15, 1955 Schwinn cantilever frame fronted by a JCHiggins double springer fork, is intended to be deranged--why else expend creativity and effort? To build a copycat or clone? Not here on Snob Hill, home of NoCal wallet-open creative constipation!\n\nOk, so we've got this old frame (Ebay find, sandblasted and rust-patinaed before we acquired it) and the oddball Cthulhu front end. Pop some new tires and rims on it for some cholo contrast. Fellow instructables denizen, Winged Fist, likened the seat to a medieval torture device, but it's comfortable as long as you're wearing pants.\n\nThe dashboard was also an Ebay find--some small-town Indiana MacGiver wannabee whipped it up from some old aluminum sheet, green reflectors, a lamp switch, his dad's mantlepiece Weather Station (brass clock, barometer, and thermometer) and then damascened it like the engine block of a Bugatti T57.\n\nIt is a work-in-progress; the headlight and taillight are both placeholders. We'll probably plasma-cut and TIG a new chainguard to match the Whizzer motor's recess. I know the crank set needs widening. We have to build a gas tank, and I want it to fit where the stock horn tank once resided--I think those Whizzer peanut tanks look silly straddling the frame top bar.\n\nProgress reports as things move along.

While I hadn't put in the mileage I would have liked for this challenge and I don't have a patch kit ( a little risky ), I still went for it. I know that when your exercising for a long period of time you need to fuel yourself or else you will hit a wall and feel sluggish because there is no fuel in the tank. I got a banana, dried mangos, a fruit bar, a protein bar, a bottle of coconut water ( for electrolytes ), and a lot of water bottles. I put these items outside near my house so I could come back to them during the ride and refuel.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FY4/NLHX/IQCMJVIV/FY4NLHXIQCMJVIV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Preparation"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "After having a lot of strawberries and yogurt, I headed out at 2:50 pm and started the ride.

But aside from these obvious signs also look for trees and bushes with \"rubs\" on them; these will be spots where the bark, cambium, and sometimes even the sapwood have been scraped away from a portion of the tree from a deer or elk rubbing against it with its antler.

If you don't like long detailed articles, you should stop reading now, as there is no condensed version of this available (nor will there be) due to it's nature (and my writing style). :-) You probably won't want to look at my Electricle\" bike motorization project blog, either, which is where this project and article evolved from.\n\nI've read Instructables for a long time, but never contributed until now. I'm sure this instructable needs improvement, and I may revise it considerably depending on feedback, but keep in mind that this particular thing can't be made as specific, instruction-wise, as an instructable really should be made. Any constructive feedback is welcome, though I may not be able to implement it all.\n\nHere's how to make your bike safer to ride at night (and even in the daytime!) while recycling some old computer parts you may have laying around. My specific goal was to use only recycled parts if it was at all possible, and so that's what I did for almost everything except for the LEDs. I've included instructions on how I did this with the parts I had available, but because this instructable covers a basic idea rather than something with a very specific parts list, you'll need to do some work on your own to figure out how to disassemble/assemble some things, based on the parts you actually use for your lights.\n\nMine is intended to be daylight visible simply because around here, not many people seem to know what hand signals mean (they were not even on the drivers' test last time), and fail to comprehend why I'm \"waving my hand around\". :-( Even a few law enforcement officers do not seem to know what they mean. However, *everyone*, driver, pedestrian, cyclist, etc., knows what the lighted signals on vehicles mean (even if they don't actually *use* their own signals), so when I use those, I have no problems riding in traffic as *part* of traffic, safely, day or night. It also keeps both my hands on the bars, which is safer given the road conditions in many places here due to \"construction\". The goal is not to have them blindingly bright, but simply at least as visible as a motorcycle. If they are too bright at night, they will simply blind someone momentarily, and may end up causing the accident you were using them to try to avoid.\n\nSourcing the parts is easy, even if you don't have something yourself laying around that will work, as Ebay probably has some if you don't mind the price. I don't recommend that, simply because it will cost you a lot to do this in the end. If you are patient, you can probably gather all the parts (except LEDs) for free from your local Freecycle.org mailing list groups. I see stuff that could be used for this at least once a week or so on one or the other of the local Phoenix, AZ Freecycle lists, which have a few thousand members total, giving away old stuff they don't need anymore.\n\nI used the slide/film-negative backlight adapters from an HP and a Microtek scanner as the base units simply because I had the HP already, and found the Microtek for a couple bucks at a thrift store. Any of these units that has a bar shape and a reasonably large surface area for the white fluorescent light in them can be used.\n\nThe Philips LumiLEDs are all new, and the most expensive part of the project--almost everything else can be taken from recycled parts, but you're unlikely to find the LEDs that way, unless you get lucky in an automotive junkyard and run across a car with LED signals that haven't already been stripped off or crushed in whatever accident placed the car there in the first place. Make sure you order *actual* LumiLEDs, and not the knockoffs; there is a huge difference in the brightness and current between them--I had some of both due to a vendor mistake, and the knockoffs are not nearly as visible in daylight, while the LumiLEDs easily are. Unfortunately they are SO bright that regardless of settings and distance from them, my little Sony digicam cannot distinguish the difference :-) so I have no comparison images. As it is, it's hard to see the difference in color between the red and amber ones, though there is absolutely no question about it with your own eyes.\n\nThe basic concept is that you will use the actual fluorescent light in the scanner adapter as a headlight, running from 12v (most are already 12v; some are 9v but will run without issue on 12v for years, and are brighter that way, a few will burn out if you use higher than rated voltage, so test carefully and at your own risk. ;-) ). Installed in the ends of the casing are the front turn signals, which are also the marker lights. In some of the unused space inside the casing will be the turn signal electronics, which are very simple.\n\nThe taillight has to have the fluorescent light removed (save it as a spare for the front one, especially if it's identical), because using a red gel or other filter on a fluorescent light won't get you enough usable light to be worth it, compared to LEDs. So you'll be adding an array of red LEDs in the taillight casing, and four strips of LEDs at the ends, one facing the side directly, and one facing the rear directly, on each end. The electronics to switch between these will all be inside the casing as well.\n\nThe handlebar signal switch can be any switch that has a center-off and toggles to one position on each side of that center. It can be vertically or horizontally mounted. Since I had one already, I used a pre-existing electric scooter's turn signal switch, because it is already in a handlebar mount. (Remember, my goal was also to use as much recycled material/parts as possible). I don't recommend using a stick-type toggle switch, as it's far too easy to break it off or damage it if you need to turn the bike over for changing a tire or servicing it when on the road, depending on where you mount it. It's also possible to accidentally catch your riding gear on it, or a shirt sleeve, etc, and either hurt yourself or tear the shirt. The rocker switch type is much better, but it is difficult to find them in weather-sealed versions when using recycled parts, so you might have to modify it with a bit of sealant to fix that, or simply accept that it might have to be replaced or cleaned due to water/etc.\n\nThewalkaround video below shows the lighting system in my living room, with no other lights except that.\n\n\nThis second video (steady shot from left rear of bike) shows the turn signal running, just after nightfall in my \"carport\". Behind the camera is a typical mercury-vapor streetlamp, and to the left of the bike is a covered up junk car for project parts, just visible from the light of the bike lamps.\n\n\nThe first pics below show the bike lights in comparison to a typical car, in a parking lot with a closed and half-darkened store behind them, and a typical mercury-vapor streetlamp off to the side and above. Keep in mind the battery for the lighting system hasn't even been charged in over a week before these images, and is nearly to the point where the longer LED strings will stop lighting (this actually happened on the way home, due to my forgetfulness, thankfully since the rear signals are shorter strings they still worked fine). Yet even so, they're bright enough to be noticeable here. They're several times brighter on a full charge.\n\nThe second (new) set of pics are in my carport, taken the same day as the second video above. The pics are in 4 sets, from just before sunset (on the other side of the house from the carport, so no direct sunlight shown) to just after nightfall, and show the bike from each side, with the left turn signal blinking. Where possible, there are images from each lighting condition and angle both with and without the signal, but because the camera has an unpredictable short delay after pressing shutter button and actually capturing the image, I could not get a shot of each even after dozens of tries. I did get many in-between states, oddly enough, where one LED set was in the process of dimming, and the other just beginning to light, which is very strange, since that time period is *extremely* short, compared to the time each LED set is actually fully on (see the video for example timing). None of the in-between pics are posted, as they're not important to how the light works. :-)", "title": "Bicycle Safety Lighting and Turn Signals From (Mostly) Recycled Parts", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Bicycle-Safety-Lighting-and-Turn-Signals-From-Mos/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Since your parts are necessarily going to be different than mine, by the recycled nature of this project, I'm going to post a few examples of different items you might use for the headlight and taillight casings, and the electronics that might be in them, and how much space you'll have for stuff in there.\n\nFirst up are a few guts from various scanners and lids. The one with no casing at all, just bare bulb, is out of the actual scanner mechanism that moves in the tray under the glass. The small rectangular thin one above it in the same pic is from the lid of a scanner, for use with slides, transparencies, negatives, etc. The lid was quite flexible and flimsy, so I didn't save it with the light. Same is true of the casing for the bottom light, which came out of a bar-style filmstrip adapter a lot like the one on my actual bike headlight. The light is shorter than the other bar style one I used, and thus less surface area and less bright, which is the main reason I didn't use this one. It *would* have let me put the front-facing LEDs in, though, which I couldn't do with the headlight I ended up with. All of these shown here run on 12VDC, and take anywhere from about 250mA to 700mA. That's a lot of power, but it's also a lot of light.\n\nThe next few pics show how thin the one small unit is, and what it looks like with the light off and on. Given that it's the 250mA unit, it's pretty bright. The kitchen lighting I took these images in is 160W (4x 40W 4-foot tubes, no diffuser), directly under the light, 4.5 feet over the table. The image that shows it powered on with the light in the center of the camera was bright enough to force the camera to iris down and dim the background to not overlight the center where the CCFL lighting is. To show better how it looks side by side the next two pics show it off and then on with the camera focused outside the area the light would cause to iris down. It's not too bright, compared to other scanner adapters I've used, but it's ok for it's size.\n\nThe next series of images shows a much larger scanner adapter, which is about the size of my outstretched hand. It came off an HP, and also runs on 12V, but takes closer to 1Amp. I have an identical one I've used as a reading light for several years, and is bright enough to be uncomfortable to look directly at in an otherwise darkened room if you're within a few feet (though it does a good job of lighting the room itself). This shows you the sequence of taking it apart--the screws you see in the corners of the frame are just philips, and all that holds it together beyond that is some small clips on the edges of the gray rear casing.\n\nIt is pretty thin, about the same as my hand resting comfortably on a flat surface, but due to the way it's made it has a lot of room inside. You can see the thin (1/4\", perhaps) light module itself on it's face in the upper left of the fully-opened image. The next one shows an oblique angle across the inside of the casing, exhibiting the depth of the casing where you could put your other electronics.\n\nAfter that are the PCB and components, showing that despite the thick cable with multiple wires, it only has two electrical connections, one for power (red) and one for ground (all the rest of the wires). You could readily cut the main connector off and use the short cable left to run to your battery, if it is also on the handlebars or at the front of the frame. Otherwise, you'll need to remove the external cable entirely and splice in your own power cable, which is what I had to do on my existing unit.\n\nThere is a great variety of these things out there, and many people have scanners that came with them but never ever ever use this part. If you're one of those people, now is your chance to make it serve some purpose besides helping it's box obey the law of gravity. If not, you may know someone like this, or be able to find one easily for next to nothing in a thrift store, or on Freecycle.org. That's where all these came from--someone else's throwaways.\n\nKeep in mind that whichever one you find and use, it should have enough room inside for the parts you're going to install. Preferably with enough front panel area not used by the light module that you can mount a decent surface area of LEDs on, but if, like the large square one shown above, there is no existing leftover front surface, you can still add them onto the side edges, some facing forward,some to the side. Or you can use totally separate casings for them (it's just easier to have them all in one casing for mounting purposes and wiring).\n\nAnother consideration is how easy it is to weatherproof the case. Most are very easy--you only have to apply a very thin bead of silicone sealant to the mating edges of the case where it meets the plexiglass or other diffuser, and also at the cable entrance and back/front casing edges. Just make sure everything is working before you seal it up if you choose this method, as it's hard to get them apart again (though not impossible).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5W/RIJB/FN82WNZ3/F5WRIJBFN82WNZ3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVX/FPX4/FN82WNZ2/FVXFPX4FN82WNZ2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4K/CPW8/FN82WNYV/F4KCPW8FN82WNYV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX6/5V7Z/FN82WNYU/FX65V7ZFN82WNYU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6Z/1LGJ/FN82WNYT/F6Z1LGJFN82WNYT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV9/ECUI/FN82WNYS/FV9ECUIFN82WNYS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCH/K2MG/FN82WNYQ/FCHK2MGFN82WNYQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ6/CN0E/FN82WNYO/FZ6CN0EFN82WNYO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRO/F5NE/FN82WNYN/FROF5NEFN82WNYN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9B/I8Y9/FN82WNYM/F9BI8Y9FN82WNYM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ1/FOFO/FN82WNZ1/FJ1FOFOFN82WNZ1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6M/QRKF/FN82WNZ0/F6MQRKFFN82WNZ0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS2/QU6L/FN82WNYZ/FS2QU6LFN82WNYZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRV/JYRD/FN82WNYY/FRVJYRDFN82WNYY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAB/T49G/FN82WNYW/FABT49GFN82WNYW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC3/43PJ/FN82WNYX/FC343PJFN82WNYX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Picking Your Parts"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The first thing you'll need to do after gathering all your parts and deciding which is taillight and which is headlight is to disassemble the headlight casing. This is going to be different for each person's unit, simply because there are so many ways companies have made them. My HP unit was simply screwed together with 4 #9 torx screws.\n\nUnscrewing those, and setting them aside for later reassembly, allows easy removal of the black plastic cover that holds the rest of the light module together. This cover (on mine) has the milk plex diffuser simply sitting in place, and it will fall out when you take the cover off. Behind it is the fragile cold-cathode fluorescent bulb (CCFL), inside a reflector. Try not to touch the bulb if possible; too much pressure will crack it, though it will flex rather a lot more than you might imagine. Mine has survived innumerable bumps and scrapes and even full drops of the bike on the pavement, including a direct impact of the lighting unit with a post as it fell over while I was chaining it up once.\n\nThe inverter powering the CCFL is often screwed to the back of the reflector, and doesn't need to be touched or modified in any way. You only need to avoid placing any of your own electronics where they can contact it; this is important because the biggest space in this unit is right behind that inverter, and is probably where you'll put your electronics if you have a similar module to use.\n\nDecide now which is the right end, and which is left, and mark that on the casing (simply using a marker on what will be the bottom outer edge is good). This is so that during building, testing and later during mounting you have no question over which is which. It'd be frustrating if you ended up with the right side flashing when you turn on the left signal. :-)\n\nThe ends of this particular unit happen to be just far enough from the reflector and just wide enough that the LumiLEDs fit easily into a slot cut for them. My current version, as built, has only one row of eight LumiLEDs, but was planned to have two, as the side bar is wide enough for them. This was not done simply because I didn't have enough of them at the time, and because the signals are actually visible in daylight even with only eight of them. It would be better with more, obviously, but it is up to the builder.\n\nCutting the slots for the LEDs can be done by hand with a utility knife or Xacto, or using a Dremel at low speeds (high speeds will just send molten plastic blobs flying, and they'll hurt you!). The unit I have is made of ABS plastic, so it took a little more work than a simple styrene case would have to cut thru.\n\nI recommend first measuring your particular unit by holding up an LED to the inside of the casing to see how many of them you can fit in the space available, and then cutting a slot that is *exactly* wide enough for the row or column of them you're going to use. Mine were one LED wide, and eight high.\n\nIf your reflector does not go all the way to the ends, you can make two sets of front marker/signals, as will be done in the rear, and have one set face forward and the other face to the side. Mine was not quite enough space to do this because of the screwmounts and case wall thickness, so I used the side ones only, angled slightly forward, so they could be seen from either front or side.\n\nThe pics below show some of what's described above, for the light module I had already been using as a headlight for months before adding turn signals and marker lights to it.The first pic shows it as it is now, with the lights on in a typically lit livingroom. The lights are so bright that the camera's autoiris function dimmed down the rest of the lighting to make it look like an otherwise unlit room.\n\nThe second just shows it as it originally existed, but painted and with a reflector covering a spot that had no plex to let light thru (even though the bulb itself goes the entire length). Next pic shows the front cover off, with the plex laying in the cover tray and the CCFL bulb and reflector visible. Fourth is the space behind the reflector, showing the inverter electronics mounted on the back of it, and my not-very-good wiring job inside (I was in quite a hurry when I originally made the headlight, and only cared that it worked, but since it never failed I never went back to clean it up). Last shows the unit from the side with some of the LEDs mounted and lit, but the front casing and CCFL not yet on.\n\nYou can see that there is a rocker switch mounted in the top edge of the unit--that's the power switch for all the lighting. Makes it easy to reach when riding. It's not sealed, as it's a switch recycled from a cieling fan wall-mounted control box, and eventually I'd like to replace it with a sealed switch. For now, it works, and hasn't actually ever had a problem, even in pouring rain (unlike the cheap brake lever switch).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHX/OLXL/FN82WOM1/FHXOLXLFN82WOM1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB1/459E/FN82WOM5/FB1459EFN82WOM5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS3/4YE9/FN82WOM4/FS34YE9FN82WOM4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPX/O7ZD/FN82WOM3/FPXO7ZDFN82WOM3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWM/H9U9/FN82WOM2/FWMH9U9FN82WOM2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Disassembling the Headlight Casing"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "You'll need to put the LEDs into rows or columns so they can be mounted in the casings, and wired together for turning them on. How many of them are in each physical unit is determined by your physical casing spaces. How many of them are in each *wiring* unit is determined by your power system. You can build them in the physical units so that those are also your wiring units, but you don't have to--it's just easier to think of and easier to physically do, and it's how I did mine.\n\nFirst, there are two good ways to get the power to your LEDs in a safe way that also keeps them at max brightness. The way I chose for it's simplicity and ability to do without buying parts to do it (or building PCBs) was simply to calculate and use current limiting resistors for each string of LEDs. The way I would do it if I could would be to use one of the LED driver chips designed by Maxim or TI, etc, that create constant current in the LED string regardless of supply voltage, even if it drops below the voltage the LED string requires (by boosting it up), and which can also be used to dim the LEDs, as this would allow for a much much brighter daytime LED array, with an ambient light sensor that forces the LEDs to be dimmed proportionally to the ambient light, so as it gets darker the lights are dimmed so people aren't blinded by them, and they are then safely just as visible in the daytime as they are at night. This instructable doesn't cover doing that, but if you are capable of making surface-mount sized PCBs, the chips those companies (and others) make for automotive and home lighting use have reference designs in their spec sheets that you can use to build even better lighting and signalling than I have here. :-)\n\nEach LED is 2.0VDC forward voltage drop, so you should plan your wiring of the units based on the idea that you will have some small operable range of voltage for your system, preferably by regulating the voltage from the battery in some way, so that the LEDs don't get overcurrented and damaged or destroyed, but also don't just suddenly go dim on you while riding because your battery didn't last long enough (dropping it's voltage below the chained-together voltage amount). Remember, though, that regulating the battery voltage with any of the linear regulators (like a 7812) will waste a lot of power as heat, and will also simply stop working altogether as soon as the battery drops below the regulator's input minimum. So I didn't use regulators.\n\nThat sounds kind of confusing, so think of it like this. I used a 12V 7AH SLA battery simply because I had it nearly-new from a weedeater with a burned out motor, and it had a simple charger I could readily move to the bike (self-contained wallwart style). That means I could use 6 LEDs at 2V each to utilize that 12V, but as soon as the battery runs a little low, they'll all go dim very fast because there's not enough voltage to get them to draw the current needed to light up properly. Using 4 or 5 LEDs would give me 8V or 10V with either 4V or 2V to spare, and you shouldn't really drop an SLA below 10V anyway.\n\nThere will need to be current limiting resistors on each series strip of LEDs, limiting it to 70mA (for LumiLEDs) at the highest voltage the system will ever be at (usually around 13V for a fully properly charged SLA). Ohm's Law says that for 4 LEDs of 8V drop, leaving 5V max \"unused\" voltage that will be across the resistor, you'd get 71.428 Ohms for the resistance that must be in series with them to ensure the LEDs never get more than 70mA current. For 5 LEDs, that's going to be 57.143 Ohms. For 3 LEDs of 6V drop, leaving 7V across the resistor, you need 100 ohms\n\nThe resistors have to dissipate waste power as heat, so for 5 LEDs that's going to be 5V x 70ma = 5V x 0.07A = 0.35 Watts. A little more than the standard 1/4 watt resistors are meant to take, so just in case, you should parallel two resistors of double the value calculated above for the 4-LED strings. Since the 5-LED strings end up with 0.28 Watts to dissipate, they should also be done this way, but are close enough to the 0.25 (1/4) Watt rating that if you have them mounted against something that will help them carry off that heat from the actual resistor bodies, they'll probably survive the life of these units without catching fire or damaging them. Optionally you can use 1/2 Watt resistors, but they're not as common to find in various junk electronics you probably already have laying around to pull from. :-) A 3-LED string ends up with 0.42 Watts to dissipate if using the 100-ohm resistor.\n\nSince 150 Ohms is a common resistor value, you can parallel two of them to get 75 Ohms, which will be close enough for the 4-LED strings to get them to almost their max brightness without ever damaging them. This also means that if all you have is 1/4 Watt resistors, paralleling two of them also gives you that ~1/3 watt power dissipation needed, with a safety margin. For the 5-LED strings, there are 51 Ohm and 56 Ohm resistors, but neither is good enough, because they're *lower* than the value you need, which means both over-currenting the LEDs *and* dissipating even more power thru the resistor, bringing both parts closer to being able to fail easily. A 120 Ohm resistor is available, though, so I'd use two of those in parallel for 60 Ohms total, which will make the LEDs a bit dimmer than their absolute max, but also still very very bright. You probably wouldn't see the difference even with them right next to each other. The 100 Ohm can be made with 2x 220 Ohm resistors in parallel, which makes a 110 Ohm resistor, again close enough.\n\nI was still experimenting with various resistor combos when the images with the DMM readings were taken, so they are not the actual final values. :-)\n\nFor the inexperienced but curious as to why not just get the exact value, this page: http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/data/resistor/resistor_standard_values.php gives an explanation, as well as a chart showing the basic values of 3 standard series of resistors you will commonly find. It is possible to get much closer to the exact value you might need, but such resistors will be much more expensive, and not commonly found in boards/etc. that you might have available for recycling into this project.\n\nFront marker/signals are 8 high, which splits nicely into two 4-LED wiring strings.\n\nRear marker/signals are two colums of 6 high on the rear, split into 3 parallel 4-LED wiring strings, and a single row of 4 on each side, split into 4-LED wiring strings.\n\nTaillight is a single row of 8, split into 4-LED strings.\n\nBrakelight was planned to be another of the same, but was skipped when I ran across a \"3rd light\" premade LED bar in a thorougly wrecked car in a junkyard that saved me the extra wiring work. :-) It's made of 9 very bright red LEDs inside, though not the same shape as LumiLEDs.\n\nThe front markers/signals are amber LEDs.\n\nThe rear-facing signals are amber, while the rear side-facing markers are red.\n\nI recommend that color pattern for yours, even if you use different amounts of LEDs, as they are the same as on most modern vehicles I see on the road.\n\nBecause of the super-special sale price, I did not have a choice in lens styles for the amber LEDs, I got standard 90\ufffd ones, meaning that the light should be about evenly visible for a 90\ufffd cone centered on the lens. For the red LEDs, I ordered from a different company to get real LumiLEDs, and they have a variety of lens shapes. I used and recommend the 60x120\ufffd lens shape, as this means they can be mounted so that there is about 60\ufffd of vertical viewability, which is more than enough, and 120\ufffd of horizontal viewability, and that makes the side-visiblity of the taillight and brake light much better. I recommend using that lens shape for *all* the LEDs you get.\n\nSince I both wanted to save weight and money, I did not use PCBs or even perfboard to mount the LEDs on, but rather just placed them for alignment in their respective sets on a piece of perfboard so that each LED in a set abutted the adjoining ones as evenly as possible. If you choose to get the non-spherical lens types, you need to make sure that you mount or glue these together so that the long axis of the lenses (obvious when you're holding them) is going to end up parallel to the ground. You also need to make sure the polarity of the LEDs is the same in each string. There is a bevelled edge on one corner; as long as that is the same on each LED in the string it is fine, since you'll be hand wiring them together later, so overall polarity is not important, just within the string.\n\nOnce you're sure they are all in the same direction, then VERY carefully place a single tiny drop of cyanoacrylate glue at the outer edge of each pair of adjoining LEDs, taking great care that none of it ends up on the surface of the LEDs, especially the lenses, and that it does not get on the leads or the perfboard.\n\nI recommend using a red marker to dot the ends of your red modules in a non-lens spot as you are placing the LEDs on the perfboard, as the LumiLEDs are all completely clear casings, and you cannot distinguish them unless they are lit up. :-)\n\nI chose to let mine sit for a day before any handling. Gently pushing the perfboard downward on a flat surface pushes the LED sets out of the board.\n\nWiring them requires some careful use of the soldering iron, as you only want to place enough solder to make a solid electrical connection and keep the wire from falling off from vibration, without heating the LED very much (too much heat will damage them). If you haven't ever soldered anything before, practice on extra wire or old parts or recycled boards first, before you attempt the LEDs, unless you happen to have enough money for ordering spares. :-) I won't go into good soldering practice, as there are a lot of places with good tutorials for this. Just remember that practice makes perfect.\n\nTo wire them, I just cut 1/2\" of wire off of a bunch of unused resistors I had around, including those I would be using in this project. That's enough wire to go between each LED in a string and wrap in a J or U bend around the leads on either end, to crimp snugly to the LEDs lead with your needlenose to hold it prior to soldering. Also place a length of wire on each end lead of the string, black for the negative (cathode) end, and red for positive (anode) end, just so it's easier to remember and wire up later. How long the wire needs to be depends on your casing and how many strings you are putting in parallel in each spot. It should be at least long enough to reach across the entire length of the casing inside, plus an inch or two for oopses.\n\nDo all the wiring before you solder. You can then test your string with your light's chosen power source and the appropriate current limiting resistor you calculated previously. If the string lights up, you're ok to solder. If it doesn't, you need to first check your connections, to make sure they're not loose--if they don't conduct power without the solder, they're not good enough connections. Don't depend on the solder to do anything more than ensure the joint doesn't come apart. :-) If the connections are good, then make sure your LEDs are actually in the correct polarity. If you find one that isn't, you can either break the string apart, reposition it, and reglue it, or you can wire to that one in the opposite direction (which will probably take longer wires).\n\nAfter all the intra-string wiring is done and tested ok, solder the wires in place.\n\nNow that white paint comes into play. Very carefully, paint the rear and side surfaces of the LEDs, ensuring you don't get any on the front side at all. Let it dry, then recoat it at least twice more, drying thoroughly each time. What this does is help reflect (diffusely) all that otherwise wasted light that would be shining back inside your casings, and instead let it be seen by others, making you just that much more visible--this ends up increasing the surface area that is actually illuminated from just the lens area to the entire surface of the LED (albeit much dimmer than the rest of it). Once it's dry, test the LED string again. If you see a lot of light shining thru the paint, you'll need to recoat it until the minimum light shines thru a reasonably small thickness of paint--you don't want to glob it on, either. For me, 3 coats was enough to call it good, but I could have probably used at least one or two more to make it better.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJQ/7Z1W/FN82WOPC/FJQ7Z1WFN82WOPC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMX/RSGF/FN82WOPB/FMXRSGFFN82WOPB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F40/BX4L/FN82WOPA/F40BX4LFN82WOPA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJF/GMPZ/FN82WOP9/FJFGMPZFN82WOP9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Assembling LED Units"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The flasher doesn't have to do much, just provide a signal to blink the LEDs at a rate that's fast enough to notice, but not fast enough to start epileptic siezures or do disco dancing to. I chose ~1.5Hz, so it blinks pretty fast. I've seen cars with as slow as only once every 2 or 3 seconds (0.5 to 0.33Hz), all the way to as fast as at least twice a second. The faster ones tend to be more noticeable, so that's why I went with just a bit more than once per second.\n\nThe venerable 555 timer in \"astable mode\" is all I would use here. There are some good tutorial pages with lots of examples of how to use this chip, with these three at the top of a google search for \"555 circuits\":\nhttp://home.cogeco.ca/~rpaisley4/LM555.html\nhttp://www.doctronics.co.uk/555.htm\nhttp://www.uoguelph.ca/~antoon/gadgets/555/555.html\nThe old Forrest Mims III books are great resources for a lot of things you can do with them, too.\nIf you want a different rate than I used, just look at those pages and there is all the info you need to set it up any way you like. :-) You can also use transistor or other types of clock circuitries, but the 555 is probably the easiest to use for this kind of thing, especially as it has many varieties tailored to specific uses, including very low power versions. I do recommend that however you do this part, you use high resistor and low capacitor values, so as little power is used up by the flasher as possible, as most variations of this will end up running the entire time the lights are on.\n\nI actually didn't use a 555 in the existing system just because I already had the 12v electronic flasher unit from the scooter carcass, and minus it's large plastic casing the board inside easily fit in a small space inside the front headlight unit. But when I build a new set for the recumbent-in-progress, I'll be using the 555 or something similar. Part of the reason I did use the existing flasher was because it only uses power while signalling is happening.\n\nSince the LEDs would take a lot more current in total than the 555 can directly supply, it doesn't do the job of flashing the LEDs. Instead, I used simple transistor circuits to do that job, and since I had a bag of NPN 2N2222's with metal cases laying around, I used those since they'll dissipate a lot more heat before dying than the common plastic cases would, even without a heatsink. Since they are only passing current for the time I'm signalling, and actually only half of that time with the 50% duty cycle of the signal coming from the 555, they serve well enough, although the ones on the front signals get pretty hot during signalling. I've left them on for testing before use for an hour, and nothing failed, even though I'm exceeding the power dissipation specs for the transistors for the front signals. If you have no parts laying around, I recommend getting something with a higher power rating, but nothing massive or heatsinky is required, unless you parallel a lot of LED strings together thru these things.\n\nBoth of the signal paths are designed to only pass power thru the transistor during signalling, to minimize the wasted power across the transistor.\n\nThe rear signal simply shunts the power away from the side marker and into the rear signal LEDs. The 4x 3-LED strings are wired from power to the collector of the transistor. The 1x 4-LED side marker strings are wired from power to emitter of the transistor. The emitter of the transistor is wired to the current limiting resistor set, which is used for *both* of the LED string sets, just never at the same time. The current limiting resistor is chosen for the shorter strings, so the LEDs aren't burned out, which for mine is 110 ohms for 3 LEDs. Since the 4-LED strings need about half that, they're only going to have about 35 mA thru them, which means they will not be nearly as bright as they could be. Since they are the red rear side markers, and I *also* have the red rear taillight with wide-angle lenses, I was not that worried about it.\n\nWhat happens is that when you switch the 555 timer pulses with the left-centeroff-right switch so they go to one of the turn signals, they turn on the transistor which allows current to pass thru the shorter rear signal strings. Because those have a lower voltage drop even including the transistor's small (0.7v) drop than the 4-LED strings, the power is robbed from the red side markers which then go so dim as to be virtually off. The rear-facing amber 3-LED sets on that side now get all the current, so they light up, until the signal to the transistor turns off as the 555 pulses continue cycling.\n\nThat makes the rear-facing signals VERY obvious, from the side or the rear, and most importantly twice as obvious from the vehicle behind you in the next lane to your left or right, where it's most important that that vehicle be aware of your intentions and presence. Just remember that even though this makes you really visible and your intentions clear, it doesn't mean the vehicle will yield to you, so you still have to be sure you really have a place to go before you start changing lanes, etc. :-)\n\nThe front signal shunts the power completely away from the marker, and into just itself, because I chose not to use a second front-facing signal set due to insufficient parts. I recommend using the rear signal method for both front and rear, instead of the method I actually used.\n\nFor these front signals, it just greatly dims the marker on that side, so there is a blinking without total loss of light on that quadrant to indicate your presence. It's not as obvious a signal as the rear method, but it's also less important, as you are facing that direction and can much easier see conditions there instantly and react to them.\n\nBecause they aren't easily just glued together, and they get hot, all the transistors and current limiting resistors *are* mounted on perfboard and wired up there. A PCB would be easy to do, too, if you feel like it, but I never drew one up--it's too simple to wire to worry about for me. :-) There is one piece of perfboard in the front module and one in the rear module, each containing all the transistor/resistor parts for both side's electronics, so two of each.\n\nIf you used identical front and rear signals (except for colors, having all amber in front), you'd be able to use a single board in just the front module and save some parts.\n\nYou can use many other methods of switching the power to the lighting sets, but most of them are going to waste power across a transistor when it's not necessary, and this circuit only does it when it *has* to, for the shortest amount of time possible to do it's job.\n\nI used silicone to attach the perfboard to the inside of the casing after wiring it to the LED sets.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 4: Flasher Unit"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The taillight is easy. It's just strings of LEDs with appropriate current limiting resistors on each, running from power to ground, always lit up.\n\nThe brake light is an additional set of LEDs wired the same, except that it does not directly connect to power--first it goes thru the brake switch.\n\nThe brake switch can be done in several ways. The easiest is to buy a brake lever with integrated switch, but most of them are very cheap, plastic handle and all, and the momentary switch inside is not sealed against anything, almost exactly the same switch you'd find inside your computer under the reset button. I used one of these at first, but it didn't work when wet, and the handle lever flexes a lot when squeezing the brake hard, like it's going to come off in my hand or something. Ugh.\n\nSo you can instead use a magnet and a reed switch. Reed switches are really neat, in that they're completely sealed against weather by their nature, and simply close (or open, depending on type) whenever you get a strong enough magnet close enough to them. Most of the security systems in homes use these on doors and windows in easy-to-mount plastic boxes with either screw terminals or wired tails, so you can order them online if you don't have any around. A bare reed switch can also be used, but they're fragile and you'll have to mount them carefully so the leaves of the reed inside are at the right angle and rotation to be affected properly by your magnet. Either way, it's important to get the right kind. What you need is the Normally-Closed (NC) type, meaning when there is no magnet nearby, it is closed, or shorting across (on).\n\nI actually used a bare reed out of a really old calculator keypad I'd gotten in a junkbox many years ago. Silicone sealant was used to secure it to the bottom of the hinged area of the brake lever mounting, parallel to the edge. I soldered it into the power path for the brake light at this point, after the silicone cured (overnight) Then I experimented with magnets I had laying around to find one that was very small and would trigger the switch open only as long as I was not pulling the brake lever *at all*. I found that one off the back of a name badge worked perfectly, and glued it on the bottom of the brake lever itself, at it's base by the hinge point, so that it was where it would keep the switch open unless the brake lever is pulled a little. I have it set so that I can pull the lever a tiny bit to engage the brake light without actually engaging my brakes, so I can *indicate* a stop without actually slowing down first, to warn bumper-huggers behind me that they're about to run me over without forcing them to actually do so. :-)\n\nI would recommend using the enclosed type, as they're less fragile, though. I already broke two of them as the bike's fallen, and while not difficult to replace, it's annoying. The enclosed ones wouldn't have been damaged.\n\nIf you intend on using higher-tech controls for all the LEDs, so they are dimmable, etc, you can instead use a Hall Effect sensor in place of the reed switch, and that'll be nigh invulnerable. ;-) But you can't pass power *through* a hall sensor, so you would need to run that signal to the dimmer for the brake light instead. Or have it brighten the taillight, which could have all the LEDs wired up to it for both tail and brake, just running at 1/2 brightness until braking occurs. Either one doubles the brightness for you, indicating braking pretty clearly. Your choice. :-)\n\nThe only thing you really have to modify about the taillight casing itself is to remove the plex diffuser (if any) and the lighting module and inverter, since you will not use those here. If you prefer, you can use something else to house the taillights, such as a project box or almost anything you can seal to be weather resistant. You may still want some type of diffuser for the LEDs, simply so they have the biggest apparent surface area possible, which makes you more visible than a very small very bright point of light.\n\nI used old cottage cheese container lids, because they're translucent and flexible. Unfortunately they're also impossible to glue, since I found nothing that really sticks to the type of plastic they use for this. SIlicone worked the best, but it will still peel off. Still, they've stayed sealed up well enough for several months of daily riding now, and since the bike is my only transportation, everything on it gets a good workout. :-)\n\nThe images show some of the stages of construction, and images to compare the lit and unlit states with. All of the lit images where the LEDs don't appear bright are ones where the flash was used. The ones where all you can see are the LEDs were taken with no flash in an unlit room. The very last image shows the lights with the brakelight module zip tied on top, both zip tied to my bike baskets, below one of my old unsuccessful motorization attempts.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTC/PKCU/FN82WORQ/FTCPKCUFN82WORQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUA/REKV/FN82WORP/FUAREKVFN82WORP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKT/TCSD/FN82WORO/FKTTCSDFN82WORO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP5/S18A/FN82WORK/FP5S18AFN82WORK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKW/11QW/FN82WORJ/FKW11QWFN82WORJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXY/B8DR/FN82WORI/FXYB8DRFN82WORI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW7/0YRM/FN82WORH/FW70YRMFN82WORH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQW/NXF5/FN82WORD/FQWNXF5FN82WORD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ7/V06E/FN82WORG/FJ7V06EFN82WORG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJN/T8CS/FN82WORE/FJNT8CSFN82WORE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL9/M43H/FN82WORF/FL9M43HFN82WORF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAX/FKPL/FN82WORN/FAXFKPLFN82WORN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCV/2RBY/FN82WORM/FCV2RBYFN82WORM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIL/HG5D/FN82WORL/FILHG5DFN82WORL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Taillight and Brake, and Brake Switch."}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Mounting it all is going to be different for most bikes, especially for your taillight. I highly recommend putting the taillight as far back on the bike as you can, behind the entirety of the rear wheel if you can, such as on the back of your bike rack or baskets, rather than under the seat. This is because it is more visible there, and it lets people know where the back of the bike *really* is, as well as keeping it from being blocked by any cargo you might be carrying.\n\nMounting the headlight is easier, as many bikes already have a place for clamping a reflector to, which you can replace with this unit if you wish (you might still need the reflector depending on local laws). I recommend putting the headlight where it will pivot with steering, so it can light your new direction as much as the one you're already going in. It's a very wide angle light, so it doesn't matter that much, as more of it's purpose is to help you *be* seen than to see. But it does light up a lot more of the close-in road than any regular bike light would, much more like a car headlight does. You should still use a long-distance spot-style headlight , preferably one mounted on your helmet, so you can look around at street signs, around corners you're about to pass, etc, and point directly at vehicles coming your way from side streets ahead to let them know you are there, in case they don't notice your very bright side marker lights and regular headlight. :-)\n\nI used a mount for an old generator-powered metal headlight, of which I only had the nice mount and the rusted casing of the old headlight in a junk bin. The mount clamps around the handlebars and then has a pivot pont I just bolted into the top edge of the headlight module. There are many possible ways to mount it depending on the hardware you have around.\n\nFor many cases, using radiator hose clamps may be a really effective option, for a less permanent mounting you could just use good zip ties, but I can tell you from experience that they can break during a ride after enough sun exposure to dry out the plastic, especially if you hit really big bumps.\n\nWiring it all together is really the last step. The cables you need to run are the ones from the brake handle switch to the brake light and power, from the turn signal switch on the bars to the front unit, and from power to each unit front and rear, and the turn signal from the front unit to the rear one.\n\nI recommend running the power only to the front unit from the battery, even if you switch it on and off at the battery instead of the front unit. Then run power from the front unit back to the rear one, but this depends on where your battery is. Mine are in the middle of the bike.\n\nTo hook all the front stuff to the back module, I'd use a multi-wire cable. Since none of this stuff takes much power, you can use old ethernet cabling or an old parallel cable. If you want, you can actually install connectors to mate with them (recommended), or you can just wire the cable directly into the modules. It needs to have at least 5 wires, for power, ground, the brake power, left, and right.\n\nRun the brake switch to the front unit. From there, hook one wire to power, and the other will go to the wire bundle, and thence to the rear module's brake LED set(s).\n\nRun the turn signal switch to the front unit, and connect it's common wire to the flasher circuit. The left wire will then go to the transistor base pins for the left side LEDs in front, and to the wire bundle, to go to the transistor base pins for the left side LEDs in the rear. Same for the right wire, to the right side base pins.\n\nThe headlight goes right to power and ground, so it's always on if the lights are on at all. Same for the taillight, via the wire bundle.\n\nIf you are going to have your charger charge the batteries while connected to the bike, make sure that you are not powering the lights while it charges, because the chargers often put out significantly more voltage than you have allowed for in the current limiting resistors for the LEDs, and that could damage or destroy them. Best is to use a jack (like headphone jacks and some DC input jacks) that cut off one signal (in this case, power to the devices) while the jplug is inserted. The one I used off the lawn trimmer doesn't do that, so I have to be careful until one day I get around to actually doing it that way. :-)", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 6: Mounting Everything to the Bike"}], "channel": "Bikes"}, {"category": "Outside", "description": "Recently, do to an elementary school being renovated in my area, i stumbled upon some old wood pallets. soon, while being a couch potato and trying to find something to occupy my free time i thought \"what the heck i might as well build something.\" then out of the corner of my eye i noticed a long board sitting in a vacant corner of my house. immediately the idea popped into my head why not build another deck for these wheels to party on. and thus my quest for building a long board deck for little to no money began.", "title": "Pallet Long Board Deck", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Pallet-long-board-deck/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The first step on your rather short road of making a cheap long board deck is to find some pallets.\nhowever there are some things to consider when trying to find your pallets.\n1. be sure your pallet has at least 2-3 planks of the same thickness\n2. be sure the people that are working at wherever you get your pallets are OK with you taking the pallets, or you could take them in the dead of night.

However, I have directly supervised probably almost 100 motors using this technique with zero failures, which is a pretty good success rate. \n\nGeneral instructions: \n\nDO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, TOUCH ANY EXPOSED PROPELLANT FACE. GRIP THE DELAY ELEMENT AND PROPELLANT GRAINS BY THEIR SIDES (COVERED IN PLASTIC ON THE DELAY ELEMENT AND PAPER ON THE PROPELLANT GRAINS), NOT THE ENDS.

This is often unnecessary, but is easy to do with a bit of sandpaper-the idea is to remove the rough edge on the ID of the paper tube. \n\nIf you are using a delay adjustment tool to change the delay time, now is the time to do it. \n\nAfter deburring and delay adjustment, assemble the three elements as shown in the image.

So here is what I did.\n\nMATERIALS:\n\nBuck knife with leather sheath ( Any brand of knife with a sheath will do)\nLeatherman Multi-Tool with sheath (Again any brand of Multi-Tool will work)\nElectric Drill\nWaxed thread with heavy duty needle\nContact glue\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\nTake your knife sheath and multi-tool sheath.  Place the multi-tool sheath on top of the knife sheath.  Make sure that the sides match or are very close.  Clamp these together.  I had to use a drill as the leather on both were so thick.  Mark holes on both sides of the multi-tool sheath and drill through both sheaths.  Once these are lined up, put a small amount of contact glue on the back side of the multi-tool sheath and clamp it to the knife sheath with the holes lined up.\n\nNow take a good length of heavy waxed thread and thread it through your needle.  Stitch the two together running the thread through the holes that you drilled.  Start underneath the knife sheath and tie a good knot at the end of your thread.  Run the thread through the holes until you reach the bottom hole and tie a sturdy knot.  Repeat this procedure on the other side.  The thread I used was tan in color, so I just used a black felt marker to blacken the thread.\n\nYou now have a great knife-tool combination.  Both are easy to access.

It was only good for roller skate good ways without even speed bumps. And that wasn't my intention. First I traced the outline of my eeepc on the plywood and sawed it out, worked around the edges with the file. Not notebook, but plywood edges! This part can be a bit smaller than your notebook, as it is hard to make so much room on your bike. Then I sawed two wood bricks, to screw under this plywood shelf in a way to hold it on the forwards extending pipe and not move sideways. Many bicycles has just one pipe coming vertically and then another one going to both sides. My bicycle has another one in between those two, extending the horizontal pipe more forward. Basically this shelf rests on the horizontal pipe and cannot move forward because the bricks rest against the horizontal pipe, cannot move sideways cause the bricks are on both sides of the extender pipe. To not let the shelf move down, you need to make a horizontal hole through both bricks just above the extender pipe. This hole will have the long nail through when the construction will be mounted. Be aware, that this hole is the only means of adjusting the forward angle of the shelf and later the notebook to sit comfortably to your eyes. That depends on how much you can open your notebook. The first eeepc can open up as wide as some 160 degrees, that will be how it will sit on the higher shelf. Another thing to note, the screen is not very sunlight friendly, but again, you will not look in it all the time, only occasionally.\nThe last thing to this step is to add the fifth metal part. It needs to be so long, to be bent around your extender pipe and come to the nail and have holes at ends for the nail to go through. So it is bent like a U and has holes. When you will attach your construction to your bike - put the shelf on your bike, so the bricks slide around the extender pipe, slide the U metal thingy from downside in between the extender pipe and wood bricks and slide the nail inside the wood bricks holes, and U thingy holes, so the nail sits over the extender pipe. Now the construction can't move anywhere and is stiffly attached to your bike. If you have your bricks longer down, you could even manage without the metal U thing, but two nails instead. Be sure to drill your bricks hole for the nail, so the nail rests against the vertical pipe, not allowing the construction to slide backwards.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3Y/ZTUZ/FXR6Z8VG/F3YZTUZFXR6Z8VG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Lower Part, the Stiff One"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Make another plywood shelf, same size as your notebook. Now the size matters. First take some aluminum. I got mine from an old CD-ROM, it even had some sponge like amortization stuff very well glued to it. Saw two pieces 2cm wide and some 6cm long. You can make them wider, or even make just one, but depending on your notebook touch pad or some buttons placement try not to cover any essential stuff. Also take a look at where the ventilation exhausts are, try not to cover them. Place your notebook on the shelf and put the two aluminum pieces vertically in front and draw two horizontal lines, where you need them to be bent. Then squeeze them in vice, so the line is aligned with vice edge. and carefully hammer - bend them to 90 degrees. After two attempts you should have them like flat sided U shape. The second attempt would go better with pliers, but they have to be with flat and long enough edge. And you have to hold them very tight when you hammer. And rest your pliers at the ends on something hard, the vice for example. It is enough with just one hole in each part. One short screw will hold it. Remember to file the screw flat to the plywood level, if it comes a bit out of it.\nNow the back rest, the most forward one. It is simply an aluminum holder for your notebook not to slide forward, especially when you brake. It holds to the upper shelf by three screws, all were a few millimeters longer than needed, so I filed them to same level as plywood. But only after I saw some scratches on my notebooks battery. The black part on it is again the sponge like stuff. If you haven't and old CD-ROM drive, then you need to glue some sponge or rubber there. In the middle there is a metal bolt with a nut, which holds a little hook, which in turn holds the rubber rings two in my case for each upper screen corners, I just tied them together to make long enough.. This is necessary, my trial an error testing phase showed, that the notebook can slide-jump-rotate out and decide to move in another direction than you. But I was lucky somehow catching it on the way down almost at pedal level. Not sure how long the rubber rings will hold, but I still have enough of them from old times. They were used to hold together a lot of bus tickets at bus stations.\nThe third thing for the upper shelf is two metal L shaped things on both sides, to not let the notebook move sideways. I screwed them with two screws each, but it should be sure enough with one screw. I had them with some holes, so I didn't need to drill. I bent a little end of them inwards, so they better hold the notebook. This is a weak part of my design, as it is a bit hard to get the notebook in and out. And they make a little rattle noise when harsh road conditions encountered. That could be remedied by gluing some rubber to them. Will try that at some time.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FF7/XE05/FXR6Z8W0/FF7XE05FXR6Z8W0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F66/CC49/FXR6Z8W3/F66CC49FXR6Z8W3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVJ/9BSN/FXR6Z8W7/FVJ9BSNFXR6Z8W7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUF/CNJ5/FXV39Y80/FUFCNJ5FXV39Y80.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Upper Part, the Notebook Shelf"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "This took me some thinking. Springs were considered. But I didn't have any. And mounting them would be not fun. Pneumatic or hydraulic struts... no, that's overkill from all points of view. I went to my towns hardware store. Not much there. And I saw a wire rope. A design idea came to me, bought 2 meters. Later used only one meter. At first it looked a hard work to attach the two plywood shelves together with this wire rope. This is how I did it.\nI lined up two holed metal parts in same direction as bike moves normally, and spaced them 3.5cm from edges of shelves and 15cm from each other. I drilled 4mm holes in plywood all along them. You only need 2 holes at each end2,5cm apart. that makes 4 metal parts (instead you can use 8 pieces small, short ones with only 2 holes each. I bought such, but made my design with long ones anyway) times 2 ends times 2 holes each end and at the end makes 8 holes upper shelf and 8 holes lower shelf.\nNow screw the bolts and metal parts together, just to hold it together. All 16 bolts have to go in. Hold one metal part rised and slide the wire rope under it, so it extends on the inside a few cm. Now screw the first two bolts firmly, so the wire is tight. This is the only reason, that will hold the upper shelf right on top of the lower shelf. That's why screws wont do it, you need bolts here. Make sure the wire is 90 degrees to the metal part.\nNow comes a bit tricky holding it all where you want moment. Position the upper part over the lower and slide the wire rope same way, but other end from outside to inside over its metal part. This time slide almost all wire through and on the other side over the other metal thing (over metal, under upper shelf, between two bolts). Now connect the other side of both shelves with the rope going from out to inside under the third metal thing, just over the lower shelf, between two bolts. Now the construction gets a bit easier to hold. Be sure to twist the wire, so it rests as freely as possible. The only force acting upon it is the one because it is bent. Next wire it diagonally to the same, lower shelves other corner. Let it go through two bolts again, so it comes out on the right side. Now bend it and connect the upper shelve by wiring through its two screws from right side to inside. Continue the wiring straight out to the left side. The last place to connect, is the lower shelves left, closest to you corner. Do it! Connect it!\nNow you have all the necessary wire rope where it should be, with only 2 bolts tight at one end. Adjust the length of the rope by pushing and pulling where necessary, to make both shelves aligned on top. Tighten the bolts in same order as the wire goes from the first two tight bolts. When all 16 bolts tight, you should have your construction as it will be. You shouldn't care about the metal parts bending. The only thing, that matters is that the wire is tightly screwed to the shelves.\nI ended up with my shelves spaced apart some 6.5cm", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FT7/5FYV/FXV39Y4C/FT75FYVFXV39Y4C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZY/ND5U/FXV39Y4P/FZYND5UFXV39Y4P.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Cable Mount, Vibration Absorber"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "I am waiting for more free time to test my constructable extensively.

Right now my workshop space consists of a barn and a basement at my parents house in Little Compton, RI.  In order to support my dream of creating Grizzly Boards I spend my summers working in a fine woodworking shop building custom staircases and doors and also working landscaping jobs. Through the summer months I spend my nights and weekends working on new designs, testing different materials, and building a stock of test skis.\n         In the winter, I relocate to Colorado where I work as a ski- and snowboard-tuning technician. This allows me to be in the mountains and around the culture of skiing. Skiing is simply the love of my life. The sense of freedom that comes from riding big mountains and deep snow is unsurpassed in any other facet of my life. The people who share these values are a passionate, loving, and eccentric breed, and it\u2019s an honor to be involved in such a tradition.\n         Through word of mouth marketing and allowing passionate skiers like myself to test the designs I bring with me to Colorado I\u2019ve been able to build a considerable amount of demand for Grizzly Boards. This $25,000 would allow me to afford a singular workspace of my own to manufacture, market, and perfect my skis. Most importantly, this grant would allow me to continue to be uncompromising in using the finest materials available to me. I currently sink every dollar I make into purchasing the best, sustainably harvested poplar, pine, and bamboo woods; the strongest fiberglass, carbon fiber, and epoxy systems; and the most beautiful wood veneer top-sheets.\n         Grizzly Boards uses only American craftsmanship and top of the line materials to create a handmade ski of the highest quality. The company is rooted in creativity, passion, innovation and adventure and the skis we make are a reflection of these ideals. How we make skis is neither fast nor cheap, but it certainly yields the best product, and like Mr. Jack Daniels himself, we would have it no other way.", "title": "Grizzly Boards", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Grizzly-Boards/", "steps": [], "channel": "Snow"}, {"category": "Outside", "description": "If you have three oil can, you can do this jet stove. \n\nWhen I went to camping I will use for cooking this :)", "title": "Cheapest Rocket Stove", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Cheapest-Jet-Stove/", "steps": [], "channel": "Camping"}, {"category": "Outside", "description": "Hey guys Supreme_Survival here with my first Instructable.\nSo you want to be, or are a survivalist (Prepper) and you either want to get started or improve your kit.", "title": "Survival Kit 101", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Survival-Kit-101/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Firstly, there are a number of different bags you can choose from including a Bergen, a Patrol Pack, a Holdall or even a general hiking bag.\nMy preferences is an Army Bergen because they are tough, durable and have been used since the Second World War. At this moment in time I use the 'Bundeswehr German Army Combat Rucksack' which is a copy-cat of the original because I don't have much money at the moment.\nHowever the backpack that I would suggest for beginners is my one and if you have been Preparing for quite awhile I would suggest purchasing the Berghaus Crusader 90+20 Rucsac. This is because it is a modular system which means you can incorporate extra MMPS pockets.\nHere's the web address for the Berghaus Crusader 90+20 Rucsac: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Berghaus-Crusader-90-20-R...\nEquipment that you will need inside your pack will include; a mess kit, a steel or aluminium water bottle, some goggles (NOT SWIMMING), extra clothes, your sleep system, any tools you require and a First Aid Kit.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Kit Bag"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Next, you will also need something to sleep whether it's a hammock or a tent.\nI prefer a hammock and I use the DD Scout Hammock however there won't always be somewhere for you to pitch your hammock in a bug out situations so here are two suggestion on tents.\n1: Yellowstone Matterhorn 1 person Tent- \u00a319.78\nThis is a 1 person tent which is relatively small so your pack won't fit inside, it can also be pitched in minutes and weighs in at 1.5kg.\n2: Coleman Cobra 3 Three Person Backpacking Tent- \u00a398.49\nThis tent can fit 3 men and is of a lot higher quality compared to the Yellowstone tent, the size also means you could fit two people and two packs inside the tent. However is does come at a cost in weight, weighing in at 2.9kg.\nAs well as, tents you will also need a sleeping bag and in my opinion I would pick a more expensive one in first place because it last longer and save you money down the line.\nI would suggest the Snugpak Special Forces Complete System Sleeping Bag because it consist of two sleeping bags that can be zipped together or used seperately. However it does cost a high price at \u00a3249.28+ \u00a35.90 P&P, unless you can find a good deal on Ebay.\nYou may also want to get a bivvy bag in case you stuck out in the wilderness after setting up your tent.

However don't be tempted to go out and by an Airsoft gun, Yes they can pass through a human skull but not a zombie skull.\n#1: Bow 'n' Arrow: I would suggest buying a compound bow which are more expensive than a recurve however they are usually a lot more powerful. I would suggest you also purchase Aluminium arrows which are the middle price range and also a Quiver.\n#2: Crossbow: We have all seen Daryl Dixon from the Walking Dead's crossbow and if you want that one be prepared to fork out \u00a3999.97 worth of your hard-earned cash. However you can also purchase a 200lb Jaguar crossbow from bladesandbows.co.uk for around \u00a3250.\n#3: Throwing Weapons: I wouldn't suggest these unless you have a lot of time, patience and accuracy because throwing knives and axes takes along time to master.\n#4: Air Rifle/Pistol: These are by far my favourite weapons because you can purchase rifles for as little as \u00a375 and you can purchase 500 for \u00a35. However my favourites are the Pump Rifles because you can buy ones that are designed to look like real weapons and if pointed a realistic Scar-H or M4 at someone they would leave quickly. As well as this you can also buy Air Pistol that look like 1911's, Glocks and Uzi's. These can be clip loaded to fire .177 steel ball bearings or have a catch on the top and load normal .22 rounds that are used in most AirRifles apart from Replica PCP one's that fire .177 steel ball bearings.\nSecondly, CQB (Close Quarter Battle) weapons.\n#1: Knives: These come in a variety of types including under 3\" non-locking folding knives which are legal carry in the UK. However you can also purchase Sheath Knives, Neck Knives and Locking Knives which are legal to own but illegal to have in public unless you have a valid reason, which doesn't include Self-Defense.\n#2: Swords/Katana's: These two are a lot more intimidating and someone wouldn't want to attack you if you're wielding a Broad Sword or a Double-Edged Katana.

The bands are simply chained rubber bands, which I switched to after trying tripled flatbands (which didn't work because they were thin and didn't last long individually) cut from a physical therapy latex exercise band and then trying latex surgical tubes (too powerful for what I usually do, which is shooting BBs and not larger steel shot). The bands are attached to a paracord loop on either end that are fastened securely into the top with screws and JB weld (known as \"spanish style\" on some slingshot forums)\n\nTo carry the slingshot around, I made a nice pouch out of woven paracord, inspired by the Leatherman Tool Pouch instructable posted some time ago. It works pretty well and hooks onto my belt with a carabiner. Really useful to carry on hikes or camping.\n\nThe other slingshots are also red oak, except for the funky shaped one, which is pine. All the others are not finished with anything -- only bare wood for now, which feels really nice to the touch. The funky shaped one's bands are an experiment of mine: chained rubber bands, a lot of them per segment, with all the bulk lessened by a rubber band that is tightly tied around the center of each segment's bulk.

The bikes must be safe, secure, undamaged, and not even scratched.\nIt must be a quick job to load and unload the bikes without having to remove any wheels. All I have to remove is\none seat to make room for the handlebars of the bike next to it.", "title": "Bike Rack for Multiple Bikes", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Bike-rack-for-multiple-bikes/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "After much thought I dreamed up a design with horizontal and vertical supports, all made with 2x4 lumber.\nThe horizontal supports are held at each end by two narrow pieces of plywood that span the entire width\nof the trailer. The beams are about 10\" to 12\" apart. The bike tires are clamped in place with a piece of 1/2\" by 4\" board. The holes through the support beams and clamp boards are oversized at 7/16\" to compensate for the holes not being drilled perfectly straight. My 3/8\" bolts are 5\" long and have a wing nut and flat washers at each end. You might need different length bolts depending on the width of tires and thickness of clamping board.\nOne of the places has 7\" bolts to accommodate the fat tire bike. When transporting the bike with narrower tires a piece of 2x4 is used as a spacer. Both are pictured.\nIt is amazing at how little torque is needed on the wing nuts to hold the bikes in place. If a 10 year child twists them down you may not be able to lift the bike out of the clamp. Hand tightening is all that is needed. You do not have to use a wrench to tighten.\nI can't give exact measurements for the pieces of lumber or hole placements because I just did it all by \"eye\". Kind of like playing a song by \"ear\". After you start, it is possible that you will need to exchange some hardware for a different size so keep your receipts.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGY/66X3/I98BLNFP/FGY66X3I98BLNFP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH3/X5ZA/I98BLNH2/FH3X5ZAI98BLNH2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLB/MED3/I98BLNHA/FLBMED3I98BLNHA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMT/5BKI/I98BLNHZ/FMT5BKII98BLNHZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Horizontal Beams With Clamping Boards"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I originally built it with permanently fixed vertical supports, but that forced me to lift the bikes over them. It also made the rack impossible to store. It is much more convenient to use with the removable vertical supports that can lift off easily.\nA 2x4 \"T\" framing bracket (I don't know the exact name) is attached to the base beam and has a flange sticking up. Two small angle brackets on the vertical support are used to secure the base of the support to the \"T\" bracket by wrapping around the flange. The picture shows a second support laying on the ground next to the rack. This shows the two angle brackets and how they were held slightly away from the 2x4 when it was screwed on. This small gap allows the angle brackets on the vertical support to slide up and down easily on the flange. The vertical support will be held down with a strap so it will not jump off when you hit a bump.\nThe top tubes of the bikes are secured to the top of the vertical support with a short bungee cord. A piece of hot water pipe insulation is used to protect the bicycle paint from scratches.\nTo place the bicycles this close together it is necessary to alternate them. Bikes 1 and 3 face forward and bikes 2 and 4 face backward. This is to keep the handle bars from hitting each other. The pedals must also be placed 1/2 turn different than the next bike to keep the pedals from hitting each other.\nThis design requires that the vertical supports line up with each other when looking at it from the side. This is because the tie straps that hold everything in place are connected with a spring.

The other end of the tie down straps attach to the trailer using eye bolts screwed into the trailer sideboards. The tie down straps are pulled tight with about 50 pounds of tension. The springs keep the straps tight and allow for small movements during transport.\nAgain, I must emphasize that blueprints cannot be provided for placement of clamping boards and vertical supports.

Two coat hangers were installed in the corner below the fifth eye bolt and used to wrap up the slack in the rope when the rack is lifted.\nIf I had used pulleys, then maybe one person could lift the rack into place by pulling on the ropes. To save money, I use hooks and eye bolts.\nThe rope is pulled down and place in the hooks. There is a lot of friction so the rack cannot be lifted by simply pulling on the rope. This requires one person to pull and hold the ropes while a second person lifts the rack.\nIt takes us about 15 minutes to lower the rack, put it in the trailer, and load and secure the bicycles.

As with many extreme sports, snowboarding can be dangerous if the proper precautions are not taken. You should be properly equipped with a helmet at all times when on the mountain as head injuries are one of the more serious risks.\nIt is important to be aware of the rules on the mountain. Take some time to read the safety signs that the mountain will provide to you. Signs will be located in the lift lines and on the trails as well. Each trail is marked with a level of difficulty (Figure 3) and trails with terrain parks will exhibit signs that include the rules to the park (Figure 4).\nMake sure you know your skill level before you try anything too courageous. When performing a trick on a feature you must analyze the feature first. Take a few runs through the terrain park and check out all the features. Although snowboarding may be dangerous, it can be safe and extremely fun if you know what you\u2019re doing.\nIn the case of performing a backside 360, you\u2019re most likely going to attempt the trick off of a jump. Jumps come in all different sizes so it\u2019s best to start small and gradually work your way up. Snowboarding is like many other sports and takes a lot of practice to excel at.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1G/X4QV/IMC928DP/F1GX4QVIMC928DP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIJ/VYB9/IMC928IB/FIJVYB9IMC928IB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Analyze the Feature"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Unfortunately, snowboarding isn\u2019t as simple as just launching of a jump and twisting in the air. Since your feet are restricted to one board, your freedom in the air is limited. Much of the trick is performed in the approach to the jump. It\u2019s important to take the proper path leading up to the jump to have the correct trajectory in the air. Figure 5 above shows an aerial view of the ideal path for a regular rider to perform a backside 360. The purpose of the turns leading up to the jump is to gain momentum to spin around one full time. The first turn is slightly to the right and is done by leaning on your toe edge. You then must lean back on your heal edge back towards the center of the jump. Finally, it\u2019s important to be on your toe edge when you hit the lip of the jump. Also notice in Figure 5 that your board should be facing perpendicular to the lip of the jump upon takeoff. This will ensure a straight path in the air to the middle of the landing. Be sure you have enough speed to clear the landing.\nFigure 6 above displays an incorrect approach to take towards a jump. This approach begins the series of turns too early. The result is an improper launch point since the snowboard would not be perpendicular to the lip of the jump. This would cause you to travel sideways through the air and you may not even make it all the way to the landing.\nNot only is the path you take important, but also your body positioning and movements prior to takeoff play a role in how you travel through the air. It\u2019s important to have your knees bent slightly while approaching the jump to keep your balance. Also, your upper body plays a major role in gaining the momentum to spin around in the air. Right before the lip of the jump you want to throw your lead shoulder towards the front of your body, which will initiate the rotation for your 360. In Figure 7 above, notice how the lead shoulder dips towards the front of my body as I am leaving the jump. Also, my snowboard is perpendicular to the lip of the jump upon takeoff.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FP5/882G/IMC92992/FP5882GIMC92992.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFX/RHKB/IMC929AF/FFXRHKBIMC929AF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNH/P7T2/IMC929B9/FNHP7T2IMC929B9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Approach"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "For the first few attempts, it\u2019s recommended that you first get down the rotation of the spin. Once you get comfortable with the rotation, you can add some stability in the air by grabbing your board. Grabs help to maintain balance in the air and make the trick look smoother. One of my favorite grabs is the tail grab, which is performed by grabbing the tail of you board with your back hand. There are a variety of different grabs you can perform on a snowboard and it\u2019s completely up to you which one to choose.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6D/SZA9/IMC929L7/F6DSZA9IMC929L7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Maintain Control in the Air"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Landing the trick may take quite a bit of practice.

In Figure 9, you can see my head is already turned looking for the landing before my board has even completed the full rotation.\nIf you did the trick properly, you should have cleared the landing with the nose of your board facing forward.

I didn't and it worked but one or two wanted to jump away when I turned it over and soldered the other side.\nA 90 degree elbow is then placed on the top end of the spacer pipes and with the coil held in place in the tub, find the angle that they need to be at, to hold the coil on the side of the tub.\nI chose to have the pipes go out to the sides so they were not right in front of where you stand when stoking the fire.\nSo the ends go out of the tub, down the side to a 45 degree elbow (so there is room for your fingers, between tub and pipe, when attaching the hose) and the garden hose adaptors.\nCold water in, warm water out to shower head.

Field Kitchen, Tommi Potx\u2013style. These are items I retained after I got out of the army; considered obsolete, I kept them just for the sheer genius of them, and I have a lot of satisfaction out of using them on long mountain bike rides in the Rockies. A U.S. water bottle, nested in its canteen cup with a corresponding stove is nested on the exterior. The canteen stove inverts to hold the cup; fuel tablets underneath heat the water in the cup; purification tablets fit in the little pouch on the side of the waterbottle carrier.\nMess tins, ideally belong in a museum. They are good for use as bowls, pots to cook with, and a full 24 hours of emergency rations fit inside them when they are nested. They fit nicely in the C9 drum pouch. [While on a leadership course in the early 80\u2019s, the directing staff made us dig trenches with them; it was challenging, to say the least.] The drawbacks of both of these systems is weight and hygiene; the metal cup and mess tins weigh a fair bit once loaded, and can be very difficult to clean if cooked in. Beware!!!\n Perhaps the very best thing to come out of the Norwegian Army is their Plastic Folding Cup; at a 1 cup /250 mil capacity, it actually folds in half and is literally  pocket size; Coghlan\u2019s sells them for cheap. They are ideal for a quick shot of something warm in the winter.\n\nEast German Water Bottle- I just don\u2019t know how the East Germans expected to win anything, much less roll across cold war Europe, with such a small water bottle. Maybe they were expected to fight for water. Anyway, this item now holds about 750 milliliters  [pint and a half] of Gatorade powder, and lives in the Camping Box. It also comes with an teeny weeny cup, which heats up quickly over a hexamine stove.\n\nYugoslavian Mess Kit- I salvaged this from a trash heap near Medak, in the former Yugoslavia; nested inside was a square plastic water bottle. The top half is a square rectangular plastic bowl, while the bottom half is a mated aluminum pot with a  fold-out latch/handle. I have only heated boil-bag rations with water heated in it, as its made of soft aluminum, and I don\u2019t need to ingest aluminum fragments; It is an awesome item to carry other stuff in that you don\u2019t want crushed.\n\n\nThe Swiss Army Volcano Stove- Fed with an initial igniter of a fuel tablet, just pile twigs and small branches in for a quick heating of a big cup of something hot in the lid that serves as a cup. When travelling, they are as noisy as a bull in a china shop, but  I can be as noisy as I like now,so that doesn\u2019t matter. It  comes with an aluminum bottle which, unfortunately, utilizes a cork; I plan on purchasing a Sigg water bottle with a screw-top to replace it; then a whole bottle of water can be heated at one time- remove the lid before doing so!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJI/JXT1/GZ0JIF5I/FJIJXT1GZ0JIF5I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRE/5AR3/GZ38JA7W/FRE5AR3GZ38JA7W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F78/MLRT/GYZNVNO9/F78MLRTGYZNVNO9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZF/FI7E/GYVDJ6J5/FZFFI7EGYVDJ6J5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP2/FOO9/GZ0BVXN2/FP2FOO9GZ0BVXN2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7B/YI4J/GZ0JIF5T/F7BYI4JGZ0JIF5T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI4/PAPS/GZ0BVXO6/FI4PAPSGZ0BVXO6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0V/3P7A/GYVDJ6S7/F0V3P7AGYVDJ6S7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRM/1QT4/GYZNVNPZ/FRM1QT4GYZNVNPZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJT/K7G7/GZ0BVY0U/FJTK7G7GZ0BVY0U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPX/TFB5/GZ0MMC9O/FPXTFB5GZ0MMC9O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3P/0T5R/GZ0BVY7J/F3P0T5RGZ0BVY7J.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Field Kitchens, Tommi-style"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Gas mask Containers- we used to lug these things around all the time, as have countless soldiers since 1914.

And no, I'm not talking about an apocalypse where there's a whole bunch of half minded, guts falling out, flesh hungry, people chasing zombies. I mean a big world disaster. The kind that either many earthquakes happen and you need to survive in the woods, or when food supplies go out and everyone goes crazy in search of food and you with your survival pack have acquired food because you're awesome (maybe not that one... but hey, it sounded good), maybe meteors rain down on the earth, or just the economy crashes and there's a huge outbreak of INSANENESS!!! So besides all of those crazy thoughts, just some disaster that you need to escape and go to the woods to survive. And hopefully everybody knows that it's likely there won't be cell reception when the apocalypse happens so hate to say this to some people, but forget the iPhone! But after those thoughts, then it turns out you wouldn't be prepared for the apocalypse!!! Well I have thought at least one of those thoughts. And then your next thought might be, \"I'm totally not prepared for some world disaster!\" Well everyone, you're in luck! I have a quick and sorta-kinda cheap answer to your worries. The survival backpack (or sack pack if you want to be technical). Just follow these easy steps and you'll be ready when the apocalypse comes around.\nAlso, I have entered this into the Apocalypse Preparedness Contest so if you could, vote for me cause that would make my day! Thanks!!!", "title": "(Apocalypse) Survival Backpack", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Apocalypse-Survival-Backpack/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "So the first thing you need to find to get started on your survival pack is, well.... a pack!\nThe one I got was just a regular Under Armor sack pack, although if you want to stay cheap, I recommend getting a different type or brand of sack pack because that thing cost me $20, but it is great and durable and I've had mine for about a year now and it's served its purpose well! Now that you have your pack for carrying things in, you need to take to note the 5 C's of survival. Everyone knows the 5 C's! And if you don't know them, they are one of the most important things to surviving in the wild. So they are...\nCutting: First and most important C. Cutting tools like a knife help with getting firewood and also help with survival a little more than a snare or a fishing spear, since we can't prepare food like a fish or a caught rabbit without a cutting tool. And a knife really helps as a defense tool from wild animals or crazy people too.\nCombustion: Honestly, I would mark combustion as important as cutting. Because let's say you just got back to your camp site and then realized that you don't have tools for starting a fire to warm up to or for cooking that nice fish or rabbit you just caught. Or maybe you get a little water from a lake or stream and need to sterilize it over a fire. So ANY time you want to go camp in the woods or make a survival pack, bring something that has combustion. Because everybody knows how it is... no combustion, NO fire.\nCordage: Now you might just be thinking about that rabbit and how you might catch it. Cordage is the quick answer to that (sometimes). Something like paracord or rope is very useful because then you could make a snare for the rabbit! Or if you need to make a quick climbing rope, you could use that cord! Or if you badly cut a leg or arm, you could get the cord out and make a splint or a tourniquet to stop the bleeding.\nContainer: A container is very useful since you can carry things that aren't waterproof, or berries, roots, and food items that can spoil fast in them. You can also hold water that you would find from a lake or stream in one too.\nCover: Finally, the last C. Now for surviving, you technically don't need cover for a couple reasons even though it is nice sometimes. For instance, we don't need to cover ourselves with something like a sleeping bag, tent, blanket, or tarp unless you have something like rainaphobia (not real). But one then again, you could be somewhere very hot and so then you could pack a cloth, bandana, or a face mask to protect from the sun or even from the cold. And also, making a little hut in the winter time can save a life. And I am saying that because I have experienced being in a little homemade winter survival hut for a night and it kept cozy in -15 degrees!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FK5/LLUR/I6J7WVLH/FK5LLURI6J7WVLH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Starting Out"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "So keeping in mind the 5 C's of survival, you need to find those tools.\nCutting: A knife (preferably a saw-back) would do, same with a multi tool with at least a knife and a saw. I had also made a neck knife from the blade of a pocket folder and a spare rope laying around. Just for the heck of it you could even put in a throwing star!\nCombustion: Some matches, a lighter, or flint and steel would work. Or if you feel the need, all three!\nCordage: Paracord, duct tape, rope, or just something of the sort. I had used the last bit of paracord i had to make a paracord snake whip but it has 30ft of cord overall so i just put that in there with my paracord bracelet.\nContainer: Paper bags (pint or quart size), plastic bags(zip-lock), plastic grocery bags work too. And a waterproof little container like ones to store matches and the like in. Don't forget a water bottle.\nCover: like I had said, you don't need some type of cover, but if you feel the need, a blanket, a small tarp, a extra change of clothes, a hat, a bandana, or a face mask maybe. And personally, i would consider sunglasses, goggles, and gloves cover for your face and hands.\nBy the way, you'll have to click on my pics to read their descriptions.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBD/ECTT/I6J7WVM1/FBDECTTI6J7WVM1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYZ/WAOQ/I6J7WVKR/FYZWAOQI6J7WVKR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLY/T7Q6/I6M2MDQY/FLYT7Q6I6M2MDQY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOY/5B8O/I6M2MDPA/FOY5B8OI6M2MDPA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV8/7LBX/I6M2MDBC/FV87LBXI6M2MDBC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F00/J4XY/I6J7WVN8/F00J4XYI6J7WVN8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMS/Q41Q/I6J7WVNY/FMSQ41QI6J7WVNY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8D/FIAN/I6M2MDGF/F8DFIANI6M2MDGF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F91/5WJE/I6M2MDB2/F915WJEI6M2MDB2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQA/69TW/I6M2MD64/FQA69TWI6M2MD64.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FER/1UPG/I6M2MD5I/FER1UPGI6M2MD5I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6W/SEBA/I6M2MD5K/F6WSEBAI6M2MD5K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F69/EHUR/I6J7WVOS/F69EHURI6J7WVOS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5K/AAHS/I6M2MDFM/F5KAAHSI6M2MDFM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGD/I1SZ/I6M2MEAW/FGDI1SZI6M2MEAW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Finding Items That Fit the 5 C's"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "So now that I named the major items to have, you can start scavenging around to find other items.

Many of you made it to the\nafter-party at the alameda air control tower and I further apologize to those who got\nlost in the shuffle. Thank you for your concerns, the coast guard treated us very\nprofessionally. They were perhaps a bit displeased that they could not ticket us for\nover-loading as our draft was only about 2 inches low. Sadly that meant that they then\ninsisted on a 13-point \"freedom inspection\", which we passed on 12 of 13 counts (lights,\nwhistle, fire extinguishers, bail pump, fog horn, etc) and ultimately wrote us up for\nbeing a bit short on life jackets. to avoid future problems we're thinking of\nre-finishing our entire deck surface with neoprene lifejackets for a super plush lounging\nexperience - no more sore bottoms on long voyages!

(unless you add the dimming resistors to save power).\n\nhow is that possible?! here's why: normally we strongly recommend against running led's without any current regulation because the led's resistance changes when it heats up. normally we run led's near their maximum power rating for obvious reason - to get the most light out of them. in that situation we are right at the edge of failure if the led heats up a bit and we need a regulator for safety.\n\nthis circuit is different! it intentionally under-powers the led, keeping it well within a safe operating range even if it heats up a bit. doesn't that mean we aren't getting the full brightnes potential from the led? yes! in fact that is better for the bike blinker because at full power your battery would last only an hour or two with a 3-watt led. it pretty much boils down to this: the cost of a luxeon 3-watt led ($4) running under-powered at about 1-watt is much less than the cost and complexity of a regulator circuit to go with a 1-watt led. so we just use a 3-watt led at way less than its spec, it still makes tons of light (in fact, it is more efficient than a 1-watt led), and no regulator to deal with.\n\nthis no-regulator method is a bit of a hack, in that it is fairly specific to the Luxeon 3-watt LED and the 2.4V from the 2 rechargeable batteries - which just happens to be the right voltage to power the led's at about 1-watt. if you use a different type of led's you will need to check their power use at 2.4V but otherwise this simple method works really well. the led brightness will vary a bit as the battery goes down, but then all the cheap commercial bike lights do that anyway.\n\nalso, because we are running right off the battery we can't use white led's in front since they need 3.2V at least. yellow is good enough for me!\n\n\nthere are not a lot of choices for through-hole parts that run on less than 2.4V. if you want to make the same circuit with surface-mount parts, you've got plenty of choices.\n\nthe 555 timer is a classic component that can produce a square wave output with any frequency and duty cycle. for a blinking safety light, the desired blink rate is 7 Hz, with about a 33% duty cycle (the light blinks 7 times per second, and is on 1/3 of the time and off 2/3 of the time). these numbers are optimized for the response of the human visual processing system to produce maximum awareness with the least light / battery power.\n\nif you have a 555 already you need to check that it is a low-voltage 555C type - many 555's won't work at 2.4V.\n\nthere are many good 555 tutorials on the web, the linked one includes a calculator for how to choose R1, R2 and C1, which together set the blink rate and duty cycle of the 555 output. you can use quite a variety of values for R1, R2 and C1 other than the values i used, as long as the ratios between them are still correct. for example, you can use two 680k-ohm resistors with a 1uF capacitor instead.\n\nthe Q1 transistor is an ultra-low-threshold PFET, able to switch the full led power on and off with as little as 2.0V drive.\n\nthe D1 diode is used to drop the 3.0V from 2 x alkaline batteries to match the 2.4V from rechargeables. to support both rechargeables and alkalines at once, we can use an on-off-on toggle switch for SW1 to choose between diode or no-diode. it's a simple hack, as long as you don't leave it running in the wrong position no problem - quickly testing both settings when you turn it on is no danger. or you can have a super mega-bright blinker with alkalines and no diode, although the led's may need a heatsink then and the batteries will last a very short time.\n\n\nresistor selection\n\nthe R3 & R4 resistors are used if you want to have longer battery life - such as with AAA batteries, or with a front headlight that doesn't blink (and therefore uses 3x the power of a blinking light). typical current for the luxeon 3-watt led's direct from 2.4V is about 500mA for the red led and 400mA for the yellow.\n\nfor blinking LED we blink with 1/3 duty cycle: 1/3 the current. new rechargeable AA's have about 2500mAh capacity, for about 15 hours with 1 blinking LED with no resistor - no problem. AAA's have only about 900mAh, so with no resistor you'd be at 6 hours with 1 blinking LED.\n\nfor the non-blinking headlight you need a resistor to get decent battery life.\n\nuse a 0.5 ohm resistor to reduce current to about 300mA, 1.0 ohm for about 200mA, 2.2 ohm for about 125mA.\n\n\nThe circuit is drawn with all options, just ignore the bits you aren't using. if you want a front headlight connect point A to point C. for a front blinker connect point A to point B. or use a switch and you can have both (in which case, you may want 2 R4's for headlight and blinking modes).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F23/KFCR/F0ZSTD4E/F23KFCRF0ZSTD4E.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Circuit Overview & Parts Selection"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "your re-used old bike light housing is going to provide a nice waterproof home for your batteries, and a convenient frame mount for the light. the main thing when choosing your old bike light is whether it holds AA or AAA batteries, and how long you want your batteries to last.\n\ni recommend using AA batteries so that you can have full brightness and still get decent battery life, however it is getting hard to find AA bike light cases these days. if you use AAA, you will get 4-5 hours for a rear-only light, 2 to 2.5 hours for the dual light. so the AAA build-option includes resistors to reduce the brightness a bit and increase battery life, but if you are ok with the short life you can still get full brightness with AAA's.\n\n\nyou will need a bike light that has an easy pop-off cover exposing the battery connections - virtually all of them are like this.\n\nstart by opening it up and removing the guts - including desoldering the battery wires.\n\nnow you can see how much space is inside the case and figure out where you will be mounting the control circuit you will be building. all my cases were too small to fit the circuit, so probably yours will be too. that doesn't make it any harder to build, it just means we'll be gluing the circuit to the outside of the case where you can show it to your friends more easily.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKU/Z1S7/F0X27XSD/FKUZ1S7F0X27XSD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLL/5NR9/F0X27XSP/FLL5NR9F0X27XSP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Picking a Re-used Old Crappy Bike Light & Removing Its Guts!"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "cut with hacksaw into about 1\" x 1\" square for this project. or maybe a bit more if you dont want to be crammed (take a look at the final assembly i did on the 1x1 board and if you want a bit more legroom now is your chance)\n\nor if you've figured out how you might fit everything inside your case, cut your proto board accordingly.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ3/WB8L/F0X27XSY/FZ3WB8LF0X27XSY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Cut the Proto Board"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "first attach the 555 chip. pin 1 is in lower left corner. then the two resistors\n\non the proto-board i used it is really hard to tell where the rows & columns of connected pads are! i will try to use a much more obvious proto-board next time. with this one all the columns of pads are connected, with a break at the row underneath the 555. anyway be careful that you put the 555 straddling the break in the columns so its legs are not shorted together.\n\nif you have never used a proto-board before, first get the basic circuit working on your desk with a solder-less proto board and then switch to the soldered one. basic instructions on proto-boards are on the web, such as here: http://www.doctronics.co.uk/prototyp.htm", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJA/N7HR/F0X27XSA/FJAN7HRF0X27XSA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBO/QDN9/F0X27XSG/FBOQDN9F0X27XSG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Start Adding Parts"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "add C1 first.\n\nbefore adding Q1, glue a little plastic insulator onto the proto-board where the tab of Q1 will go.

The slats were warped/bowed upwards, which turned out to be a good thing. I used drill press to make a few additional holes in frame and hand drill for all other holes. Most every hole on trailer was conveniently 1/4\". I used bolts to attach slats to frame and pop rivets to attach street sign platform. When drilling and attaching holes for slats, I clamped them to a straight piece of wood and removed after attachment so that the bowing of the slats built into body added tension. The street sign was coincidentally a very near fit. I decided to make this trailer with a flatbed type design, using a system of holes, hooks, bungee cords, rope etc to attach whatever cargo or cargo containers necessary. I liked the open ended aspect of this as opposed to a fixed basket/box type design. I split the difference of street sign that needed to be trimmed equally on each side and this made a nice lip just big enough to drill cord/bungee attachment holes.

I took the head off of itand screwed it onto a piece of plumbing pipe. Dont remember what size, but its fairly common, I think 1/2\".

This fit nicely inside of an aluminum hitch made by burley. This is one of the few things I bought new, and the $20 seemed worth it compared to a day of messing around with other ideas. I like it so much I recommend it and plan on using them again if I make another trailer. Hurley forged hitch. I bought a ball locking cotter pin from home depot for a few bucks to go into it.

Old toothbrushes work great.\nWater: When used carefully, water can be a handy tool, but be careful here. Water, especially when coming from a high-pressure hose can cause damage to sensitive bearing systems throughout your bike. Soap / general cleaner: Use diluted dishwashing soap or preformulated bike wash cleaner for frame cleaning.\nDegreaser: A bike-specific degreaser (avoid kerosene or turpentine) will clean up gummy parts like your bike chain. Choose a solvent that is easy on the environment (and you). Dispose of all solvents properly.\nChain lubricant: Properly lubricating your chain helps extend the life of your drivetrain. Always apply bicycle-specific lube oil to a clean chain.\nThere are two types of lube: wet or dry.Wet lube is best to use when you\u2019ll be riding in wet conditions. It strongly adheres to the drivetrain and is less likely to rinse off in rain. That said, dirt and grit will also stick to it, so be sure to wipe off excess lube.\nDry lube excels in a dry environment. Dirt and grit stick less to dry lube, but dry lube does rinse off easily if you find yourself riding in the rain.\nBike stand: This will allow you to position the bike at a comfortable height while you\u2019re working on it.

For really dirty chains, you may want to use a chain cleaning device which is more thorough and a lot less messy. After the degreaser has dried, apply drops of lube slowly onto to the chain, getting some on each link. Let the lube dry, then wipe off any excess lubricant so it doesn\u2019t attract more dirt. In general, lubricate your chain whenever it squeaks or appears \"dry.\" Lubing after wet rides will help keep your chain from rusting.\nFront chain rings and rear cassette: Scrub the surfaces with a brush and degreaser while turning the pedals. If there\u2019s a lot of built-up grime, use rags to wipe away any remaining dirt and \u201cfloss\u201d between the gears.\nBrake and derailleur levers: Apply a drop or two of lube to the lever pivots and the barrel adjusters periodically to keep them functioning properly.\nBrake and derailleur cables: Check them frequently (especially in wet conditions) and re-lubricate occasionally so that they can effectively translate your commands to the component groups.\nBrake and derailleur assemblies: These consist of a number of small moving parts.

This is because it is not a very costly instructable (as far as electronics go) and the skills needed are very basic.  It is also a great application of Ohms law!", "title": "Sleek LED Helmet", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Sleek-LED-Helmet/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "This Step is all about basic LED wiring and Ohms Law.  Some of you may not need to read this and will just jump past it. However, I recommend those new to electronics to read this first.\n\nOhms Law states that I = V / R . In this, I is Current in amps (or mA as it is in LED's), V is Potential Difference in Volts, and R is Resistance in Ohms\n\nSince this equation is used for the whole circuit, it isn't very useful to us the way it is now.  We have to change it so it will give us the resister value we need.  This Equation is:\n\nR= ( Vs-Vl ) / I\n\nVs is the supply voltage; what come out of the battery.  In this project it is 9 Volts.\n\nVI is the LED voltage.  It is the voltage the LED should have.  It is stated on Data sheets you can find usually at the web site you bought your LED's from.  In my case, the white LED's I have were 3.5 Volts.\n\nI is the Amperage the LED operates at.  It is usually 20 to 30 mA ( 0.02- 0.03 Amps).  It can also be found on the data sheet for your LED.  Mine was 20 mA.\n\nSo if I was to attach 1 White LED to the battery I would have \nR= ( 9 - 3.5)/ 0.02\nR= 275 Ohm\n\nThis means that you want to have at a minimum a 275 Ohm Resister, however to sustain battery life it would be smarter to use 300 to 330 Ohm Resister\n\nNow, because one LED is kinda wimpy for a head light we will put the LEDs in not only in series but in series and parallel!\n\nThe math gets a little more complicated from here on.\n\nIf we put 2 of these white LEDs in series we have to use the equation\nVl = Number of LEDs x LED Voltage\nVl = 2x3.5\nVl = 7\n\nR= (9-7)/0.2  *IMPORTANT* Number of LEDs does not change the Amperage in the equation*\nR = 100\n\nok, so we can do 2 LED's in series, but can we do 3?\n\nVl = 3 x 3.5\nVl=10.5\n\nR= ( 9 - 10.5 ) / 0.02\nR= -75\n\nWe cannot have a negative resistor so we have to keep with 2 in series, but we want to have 4 LED's.  The way to do this is to have two sets of two LEDs series in parallel. Okay, that is really badly worded, but the picture below should clarify it a lot.\n\nNow that you understand the process go and try it out with your LEDs.\n\nIf you are not good at all this math stuff you could just enter your info onto\nThis Site\nHowever if you know how and why your circuits work it makes everything much easier when you get into more complicated electronics.\n\n\nThe Illustrations were created on Yenka and edited on Photoshop Elements", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FA9/LU2I/G1XC0HTL/FA9LU2IG1XC0HTL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN3/P2JH/G1XC0HTW/FN3P2JHG1XC0HTW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKL/92RB/G1XC0HUG/FKL92RBG1XC0HUG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: The Theory"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The needed materials are:\n  -9V battery\n  -9V battery clip\n  -4 LEDs-- I used white but any other colour would work, too.\n  -2 resistors (Value will change based on LED's, more info in next step)\n  -a switch of some sort, not a momentary; a flip or slide would work well here\n  -a good amount of wire, solid core works best but stranded is fine\n  -helmet (bike)\n  -foam for cushioning\n\nTools:\n  -soldering iron\n  -solder\n  -solder-less bread board\n  -hot glue gun\n  -hot glue\n  -needle nose pliers\n  -Dremel  tool (not needed but makes it easier)\n  -pen knife (not shown)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FEI/FC5Z/G1XBRR44/FEIFC5ZG1XBRR44.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJD/E2YN/G1XBRR0V/FJDE2YNG1XBRR0V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2C/BXO8/G23UTMTM/F2CBXO8G23UTMTM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1P/IZJE/G23UTMUO/F1PIZJEG23UTMUO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Materials & Tools"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Bread-boarding a circuit is a common practice to find potential mistakes in your design (or math).

(I used duck tape but you could use rope or hot glue)\n14)Cut two indents towards the frount of your boat so Your stick fits snuggle in between them.\n15) Place the stick in the indents so the bottles are evely spaced on either side of the boat.Use duck tape or hot glue for a secure fit.\nthe top of the bottles should be facing the front of the boat.\n16) Suck water into copper tubing then place boat into bath tub, being careful not to let the water out. \n17) Light the candle and be patient. It takes a min. for the water to warm up. \n\nOptional - Use the left over plastic from the 2 -liter and cut out a window shape. Cover the edges with duck tape to make a frame that match your sliver boat (or what ever color duck tape you used). You can also decorate your boat with other left over pieces. Like gluing an aluminum Pepsi logo on to the side.\n\nNotes:\nThe only think I bought personally was the copper tubing. Everything else was left over from Habitat for Humanity builds, including the duck tape. If you wanted to you could use colored duck tape for a different looking boat, you could cover the boat in aluminum or aluminum cans using hot glue instead of tape. You could also just forget about hot glue or duck tape and just leave the haul of the boat plastic although it might not stay together as well.\n\n*WARNING*\nCopper tubing is hot when heated. Blow out the candle and wait half an hour before touching the copper.

However, although tents work, the can be very heavy and cumbersome; such as the one pictured... there are other, more efficient methods. My personal favourite is the hammock and tarp method which comes out much lighter as, not only is the actual shelter lighter, an insulation mat is very often un-necessary as can too be pictured below. Unfortunately, i do not currently posses a tarp as there were some  unexpected circumstances causing my tarp to be located upon the fire. Aswell as actual accommodation, while backpacking you need a sleeping bag that packs relatively small, of which mine does reasonably well. The sleeping bag in question, if you are curious, is the vango NITESTAR  350 which is on the DofE approved kit list. However, despite me owning a reasonably decent sleeping bag, I do in future wish to purchase a RAB down sleeping bag which can pack down to the size of a rock climber's climbing boot. \n\n(the tent pictured weighs a few kilograms yet my lightweight alternative weighs little over a kilogram including pegs.)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAR/HMEE/HNID1SMM/FARHMEEHNID1SMM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN7/HALN/HNID1SOC/FN7HALNHNID1SOC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Sections"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "This next step shall be a slightly shorter step than the previous (hopefully) as it involves less description, and shall focus on cooking and eating. Now, many traditional campers my swear by the Tranjia cooking system (which I love) however, there can be lighter alternatives that work the same way, or use a completely different system all together. My personal favourite method of cooking is on a tin can alcohol stove which is basically the Tranjia system without all the excess materials. It is made by cutting two tin cans and forming the burner... I then went an extra step and spoke to a friend of mine who created an aluminium stand and wind break for this stove.

Please not that this clip does not belong to me and is simply to be used for reference:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdJ-MzPGCmM \nTo light this pour in your alcohol or methylated spirits and a bit over and around the stove to prime it, light it then put a penny on the central holes to keep the pressure. \nThe other cooker type is the HEXAMETHYLENETETRAMINE (HEXAMINE)  stove used by the British military.

However, you can also use this for signaling others in your party if your in a group.\n\n22. Duct tape- Where do you start on how to use duct tape in a survival kit? Ductape has so many uses, it should be standard for all kits. Repairs, markers, anything can be used with duct tape.\n\n23 Camping Saw- use this to cut your logs in to smaller logs for fires, or to mark trees, or to cut off limbs, or anything else. (Note: While i don't think it would be necessary, it can also make a weapon against unfriendly animals and people. I don't suggest using this as a weapon unless it is absolutely necessary to survive.)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F34/QLA0/G51GRTOC/F34QLA0G51GRTOC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3:"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "24. How to Stay Alive In the Woods book- This book is essential in surviving out in the wilderness. It has many entries that will help you find food, make fire, make shelter, stay found, and medicines you can find in nature. A MUST HAVE!!!\n\n25. Crowbar/ Wonder Bar and Mallet- The wonderbar has many uses, some of which include opening doors in abandon buildings (IN SURVIVAL SITUATIONS ONLY!) as a weapon, and even as a make shift grappling hook. The mallet is obviously used for hammering things, but can also be used as a weapon or as part of a trap.\n\n26. Belt- this is good for not only holding your pants up, but you can use this to help you climb trees or similar if you dont have rope/ grappling hook. It can also be used to hold onto your knives and other things that clip onto your belt for easy access.\n\n27. Fire Starter (kindle)- This is good for starting a fire or keeping fire going when fuel is scarce.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FF4/UPVN/G51GRTOA/FF4UPVNG51GRTOA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4:"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "28.

Sharpening Stone- This is used for keeping your knives sharp all the time. (Recommendation: Get one that has a coarse side and a soft side.)\n\nNow, this is what i have in my kit. I only consider some things in this kit to be standard in all kits. Each kit should be designed for each individual's particular needs. Some kits have more water based things for those who live near water while others are based on water use for dry areas. But as i've said before, this kit is for those who don't know if they want to stay in the city or go to the forest.\n\nPlease note not everything i have in my kit is shown due to size.\n\nFor example, my first aid kit is really big, so i cant carry it in my kit. That doesn't mean that a small one wont help just as much. It is up to you.\n\nRemember, in survival, the important things you'll need is to keep a cool head, stay safe, and be prepared.\n\nIf you enjoy my kit, subscribe to my account and keep an eye out for my videos where i show you how to survive in various conditions.

And this solution is to have the cooler buried in the river under a tree shade and sometime when was to hot I used salt too for the meet. All other products, like vegetables and dairy products was OK for me to eat after more the two weeks. Of course, you can add if you have how few plastic bottles with water frozen in inside to the cooler think that will almost double you change to have a piece of meet on the table with out hunting or trapping. I'm using this method for long days of driving on the backcountry road and I had the water frozen in the bottle after 6 days of keeping the coolers in the truck crossing the desert too.\n\nThe project its simple and this are the steps that I did after I found a safe location closer the my camp and under shade.\n\nFirst at all, I believe is better to be gather all the materials that you need, natural or man made for a faster and a organized job and in the end for a finishing touch, you just grab and gather the material what you still need. After that, what is left, was to dig a trench on the bed river, pound few sticks on the edges of the trench and form a link with the rope between sticks on the downstream for extra protection from river currents. Because I had two coolers and the river currents was fast and over night had possibility the river to getting higher, I did a extra work on this project and I build a rock wall to around to the coolers with a point of water entrance and exit about one feet from the wall top. Beside controlling the river currents power, this entrance and exit had roles of keeping the water colder and circulate like in a cooling system. Once all this its done I just drooped the cooler in, tight them up with a rope the handles and cross one bungee cords over the cooler lid and just hook up on the sticks that I pounded special for this at the middle of the length of the cooler. For extra safety for the cooler from the river currents and wildlife I added few boulders on the top too. On the end, I got few local trees branches over the coolers and by lateral by stick them in the river bed for a better shade and camouflage them from curios eyes. Once in a wile, I just refreshed this natural \" wall \" of vegetation.\n\nFor this project you need:\n\n\na shovel or you can improvise something for digging on the stream bead a trench to lay the cooler.\n\n\n\nfew sticks about 3 feet longer ( the length can be different from what I used  just because of the size of cooler will be using or the bed material of the stream, river etc that can be strong or soft ) that will be pounded on the stream bed and in the corners of the trench.\n\n\ntwo heavy duty bungee cords ( here the length or number of bungee cords its at you discretion because of the size of the cooler or coolers number that you are using)\n\n\nfew feet of rope for extra safety, in special if the stream or river its fast or can become faster because of different reason, natural or man-made. The rope I used to tie the cooler  handles and also, I used to form a link between the stick. In special on the down stream side.\n\nalso, I used few boulders on the top of the cooler for extra weight and keep the cooler safe from wildlife in despite that the bungee cords had been crossing over the lid with enough strength.\n\nother materials that you need are enough rocks and boulders for building a rock wall around to the coolers and along to the trench.  ( The wall will have a enter and a exit point for the water about one feet from the top) and few brunches of local trees for keeping shade and camouflage the location. I used few branches by stick them in the river bed and others on the top.

Watch this short how-to youtube video on how to use it and you can upload the pdf freely below.\nAs I try to build better diy stoves I look around the internet for inspiration and I see many rocket cook stoves that have missed basics (like an insulated burn chamber) or are built out of materials that will be short lived (such as metal burn chambers). I\u2019ve built a few of these stoves and they do work but are short lived and/or probably not nearly as efficient as the ones originally designed and tested by Larry Winiarski. So I\u2019ve been working on a design tool to get better results.\nI wanted an assessment tool that would quickly give me an idea of how well a stove works without lighting it and ideally before I even build it. There are several rapid assessment tools that are used in health care. These help to give a standardized and rather objective score to what would otherwise be a lot of subjective findings. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is probably the most common of these. It scores a patient\u2019s level of consciousness on a standardized set of criteria. If you\u2019re posting on premies, you\u2019re a 15/15. But if you\u2019ve fallen from an Instructables project and hit your head your score might be much lower. Research has correlated GCS scores to patient outcomes. A GCS score of 8 or less and your chances of survival drop.

(-4\u00b0C.)\nNOTE: Please keep in mind that this is a method of removing frost, not snow or ice, although it may work if it's not too cold and the ice or snow are thin enough.", "title": "Clear Frost From Car Windows", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Clear-Frost-From-Car-Windows/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Tools:\nEmpty milk jug (gallon or half gallon) One less in the landfill.\nSqueegee (long-handled is better - available from auto parts stores or departments - or even Harbor Freight Tools)\nWater - inside room-temperature (60-70\u00b0F , 15-21\u00b0C) works best, but you can use cold water right from the faucet.

That way you can grab it as you leave.\nDO NOT USE HOT WATER!!! You can crack your windshield.\nWhen you get to your car and find all that nasty frost on the windows, get in your car, start it up, and turn your windshield wipers on high (fast). Unless the frost is already melting, this won't do much good - maybe scrape a little off the surface, but your wipers will quickly wipe away the water you're about to pour on. Get back out of the car (or stand between the door and the opening) with both car and wipers running.\nDO NOT LOCK YOUR DOORS - this will tend to make you very late for whatever you were planning to do.\nStand to the side (to keep your wipers from throwing freezing water on you) and pour the water over your windshield. The water will be warm enough to quickly melt the frost and warm up the windshield to prevent ice from forming before the wipers can remove it. If some ice does form, simply pour more water on. The third picture was taken about 15 seconds after the first one.\nIf side or rear windows are also frosty, you can use some water and the optional squeegee. Pour it on and quickly squeegee it off before it freezes. It also works on rear-view mirrors, but not as well as they are often recessed and the squeegee can't get to them very well. When enough frost is gone to see clearly, put the top on your water jug tightly and put it on the floor of your back seat or in the trunk and you're ready to leave.

If you are like me, you find enjoyment out of making your own items, otherwise you probably wouldn't be on this website!\n\nAfter recently purchasing a couple of hammocks, I went back to look at purchasing some straps to assist with fastening to a tree. Was shocked that the strapping materials in a kit cost way more than the 2 hammocks I bought put together. So, I set in to make my own!\n\n1st you need to find your local outdoors store that sells climbing ropes and strapping material. As you see in my materials list, I purchased some hollow strapping 1\" width. It will be your judgement on the length you wish to purchase, but as I bought, 2ft is sufficient for each end, and enough to go around the back side of each tree to protect its bark and/or trunk from damage.\n\nMaterials:\nHollow strapping material (2ft per end = 4ft Total)\nParacord (however much you need) I am using approximately 11-12ft as explained further in instructions.\nLighter\nScissors\nCarabiner x 2 (durable to withstand weight limit; NOT the cheap $ store kind)\n* Hammock\n* Lastly, two trees\n\n\nNext step!\n1. Cut your strapping as mentioned above, into approx. 2ft pieces. If you pinch strap together you can see how this material is hollow. Once separated, lightly singe with lighter to prevent further fraying.\n2. Paracord: First double the cord in half to aid in strengthening. After doubling, cut to desired length. I used a piece about 11 to 12ft in length.\n3. Once doubled, slide paracord thru strap until you can grab on other end of strap. This can be a little tricky to slide thru, but if you maintain pinching strap in half it will help.\n4. Now that you have the strap slid thru, take the loose end and tie together in a quick knot.\n5. Next step will be to go down end of cord and tie several knots, which will help when securing hammock to strap. Depending on the distance between your two trees, you can adjust tension by moving to the next knotted area as seen in photo with carbiner.\n\nThat seems to be about it. Will try to show photos of strap in use, but currently hammock is hanging around down in basement until further use!\n\nAlso made a carry bag to keep straps in for carrying in your backpack, which I can show in separate Instructable.", "title": "DIY Hammock Straps", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Hammock-Straps/", "steps": [], "channel": "Camping"}, {"category": "Outside", "description": "This is something that I've been tinkering with for two days.

One could free-hand it, but I've found it quite easy to make nice looking stuff using this method. The pattern should be attached here as a .bmp file. Open it with paint, print it out and check the distance between the dashed lines on the piece labeled \"B\". They should be 5/8 inch apart. Check the width (top to bottom on the page) of the pieces. They should be .800 inch (a little over 3/4 inch, a little under 13/16 inch) wide. If so, move on. If not, see if you can play with the printing scale (file, page setup) and get them to print the right size. The easy way is to measure what printed out and work out the scale. For instance, if it prints out with a 1/2 spacing instead of 5/8, divide 5/8 by 1/2 and multiply by 100. That equals 125, so change the scale to 125% and print again. It should now measure 5/8. Coincidentally, if you want a wider or narrower extension, play with the scale to get it to print how you want it.\n\nCut around the perimeter of the A and B pieces of the pattern. Don't cut on the lines, leave a margin of about 1/8 inch or so. I used my sharp knife, use scissors if you like. Spray one of your pieces of PVC lightly with the spray glue. Stick a pattern to it.

Sometimes it comes in the form of a seemingly harmless plant. Poison oaks, poison wood, and poison sumac are some examples of plants you can encounter while out exploring and it is best that you know how to get rid of poison ivy and other plants related to it.\nWhat is Poison Ivy?\nPoison ivy is part of a family of poisonous plants that is evenly distributed across the Northern Hemisphere. Its general appearance is highly variable as it can appear to be a bush, a vine or a smattering of leaves lying on the ground. The most important tip in identifying a poison ivy is the glaring warning signs usually placed around it. On a serious note though, one of the most credible ways of identifying poison ivy is by looking at its leaf structure. Poison ivy leaves are arranged alternately and are usually grouped by threes; different varieties can have their leaves either smooth or toothed.\nHow Does It Affect You?\nA phenolic substance called urushoil is found in the entirety of the plant and is the main cause of irritation. Injuries usually would take the form of rashes and severe itching leading to dermatitis. Animals can also bring in oils from the poison ivy family into your home.\nPoison Ivy Home Remedies\nFortunately enough, poison ivy irritation is often non-lethal and several cures can be found around the house. You can definitely bring these along the next time you go out so you can address the injuries quicker.\nWashing with soap and water washes off the irritants from the poison ivy plant and this is an effective way of cooling down the affected area, lessening the rashes. However, in order for this to work, the affected part should be washed within 15 minutes after contact with the poison plant otherwise, the urushoil will have been absorbed by the body and would require proper medical attention.\nRubbing Alcohol - Just like water, alcohol removes traces of the phenolic substance from your skin and its antibacterial properties also ensure that infection is prevented. Unlike water, rubbing alcohol should immediately be rinsed off.\nCalamine lotion is not only effective against insect bites, it can also be applied to relieve the itching, dry up and blister and sooth the affected skin, all at the same time.\nVinegar - white vinegar can be used to dry up the blisters and soothe the itching. Use a half cup of the liquid, add some water and refrigerator; this treatment is best served cold.\nCucumber - cut up some cucumber slices and place them over the affected area, you can also mash the cucumber up and make it into a paste that you can spread over the injury. Cucumber can help cool off the rash and prevent itching.\nWhole Milk - Soak some whole milk in a rag and gently pat over the affected area. Leave the damp rag on for about 10-15 minutes before rinsing it.\nHerbs - Herbs like Jewelweed works wonders when applied to poison oak infections. The watery stem cools down the area and helps soothe the rash. Aloe Vera works the same way as well.\nSalty Water - Remember being told to pee on a jellyfish wound, this is the same thing. Salty water can dry up the affected area while washing it at the same time.\nApple Cider - Apple cider already has several medicinal therapeutic claims and it is considered to be a natural remedy against rashes and irritation.\nOatmeal - grind a cup of oatmeal in a blender until it becomes fine. Place the powder in a cheesecloth or clean sock and then tie it on the open end of a faucet before turning it on. The water pressure will force the essences out and you can soak the affected area in the resulting mixture.\nSteroids - As a back-up, stock up on hydrocortisone and use it only when the other home remedied listed does not seem to work for the patient.\nPrevention\nYou must pull out the poison ivy plant carefully using protective gear but you should not burn any of it as it can also cause irritation on your eyes and lungs. It\u2019s a pretty tenacious plant and does not really go away even after you\u2019ve cleared an area. It will spring up again in another location and knowing how to treat poison ivy is the next best step in preventing any further injury.", "title": "Poison Ivy", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Poison-Ivy-1/", "steps": [], "channel": "Backyard"}, {"category": "Outside", "description": "Fifty years ago in South America there was not a lot of law enforcement.

Drill the hole as deep as you can and still maintain the integrity of the handle ( I drilled mine until the point of the spade bit just surfaced on the top side, leaving about a half inch of solid wood.) The pipe is a bit bigger than the hole so I had to use my trusty Dremel and small sanding drum to enlarge the hole ever so slightly. You want a good tight fit. Then apply a good epoxy and insert the pipe into the handle. When the epoxy is set, drill a 1/16\u201d hole completely through the pipe and handle (you can see the nail in the first picture) apply a little epoxy to the finish nail and slide it through.

There are several ways to do this and many possible fittings that would work so use your imagination. Use a cutoff wheel in your Dremel to make several perpendicular cuts in the part of the rod that will be inside the fittings. This will help the JB Weld to hold better. Screw the fittings together very tightly. Mix up the JB Weld and coax it into the end of the bayonet fitting. This is a little tricky because it wants to air-lock. Once you have enough in to fill the void, insert the rod and stand the whole thing up so it will set straight. Let it cure for about twice as long as normal to make sure its solid.

They were a bit too small in diameter for the \u00bd\u2019 pipe so I added a few wraps of black electrical tape so they would just slide down the tube easily but not move around. They seemed to hold best when right at the sharpened end of the skewer so I stuck them on and laid the skewer next to the tube and marked each end of the magnets. (Sorry about these pics \u2013 I am a better inventer than photographer and didn\u2019t catch this until I had passed this step) Now, drill a small hole the same diameter as the brad nails at each mark. You will notice scratch marks all over the tube in the picture, so do as I say and not as I do and hunt up a center punch to avoid the drill bit from crawling all over the tube. Cut the brads so they are just long enough to hold the magnets without interfering with the center hole. Solder the upper brad in place, slide the magnets in against it and then solder the lower brad in place. One important note: I found the magnets not quite strong enough to hold the skewer really snug but overcame this by adding a couple wraps of electrical tape to the bayonet fitting which added just enough friction to hold it well.

Wood or bark shavings. (dry grass or paper may be used here but is not recommended as it burns far too intensely and as such will not last very long)\n\n2. Small twigs. this will serve as building blocks to the main structure of your fire (this will be discussed later)\n\n3. Slightly bigger twigs, but not too big. this will make it possible to stack bigger stuff on\n\n4. Even bigger sticks. this again will lead on to bigger sticks\n\nthis cycle carrys on and on and on depending on the size of fire you want.\n\nAn exceptions of the above are pallet wood. often found in firewood dumps. this is good because it burns for a while.\n\nYou will also need a few big logs to put around the fire if you are not in a designated fire zone. This will stop the fire from spreading and causing any major damage.\n\nAlways remember to get more firewood than you will need. this means that you can stack it on if you need the fire for longer than expected or if you wanted the fire slightly bigger.\n\nTo make a fire you need 3 things. 1: Fuel, 2: Oxygen and 3. Ignition\n\nWe've covered number one. number 2 needs a bit more thought (surprisingly) because you need to create the right sort of structure for the fire so that the oxygen can get in and you also need to make sure not to put too much firewood on too quickly because this will smother the fire and put it out, much like a candle with a snuffer.\n\nThe structure that I like to use for my fire is a basic two sticks ontop of two others and then carry on.\nThis is done by laying two sticks parallel from each other than laying two on top of them and then building it up. This allows for good ventilation and the opportunity to put your fuel and ignition in the middle, in the heart of the fire.\n\nThere are a few other types but i find none of them to be as effective, but it is just important to remember to have a structure to have an air flow (co2 goes out o2 comes in) and to get the right size sticks next to each other so the fire can build itself up.\n\nNow, the final section. ignition. there are a few different things you can use for this, including a steel striker (a carbonised steel rod struck with a key shaped piece of metal. this can be replaced with a knife or a key) this is the same concept as a striking two flints together, you can use matches (these aren't good in wind or water unless you have \"monkey matches\", these are wind and water proof matches. very hand but they burn incredibly quickly) and lighters, storm lighters or zippos are good because they are windproof too.\n\nTo light a fire create you fire with the kindlering in the middle in the middle and then start your ignition in there.\n\nCongratulations. if all went to plan you now have a fire. =]\n\ni like fire... lol", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTL/AQF5/FI36FMZW/FTLAQF5FI36FMZW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: How to Make Fire (important!!)"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "I'm not going to lie to you. i'm no expert at this. I may have been on my fair share of survival camps i still prefer to have a helping hand around when i'm creating my own bivvy, bivwhack or shelter, whatever you want to call it. I do know that it's important to have a survival bag because it's a huge orange water proof bag. This is good because it is obvious it's there because it's bright, it's warm with a sleeping bag aswell and it will keep your dry. But when it's all said and done you still need to have a shelter of some sort to survive.\n\nThe shelter i generally use is a bog one. A large stick proped up against a tree and then with fern branches coming down from either side. this creates a nice waterproof (ish) shelter that generally fits one man, but can be improvised to fit two or more by using more than one stick and connecting the two with fern branches.\n\nSorry i can't offer anything more on this subject but i can say that as i start to get more info i will post it up then we can all be true surivalists =]", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 5: Making a Shelter.

It's that simple, really. i am once again no master at this but i will explain as much as i know.\n\nThe Deadfall Trap\n\nThe deadfall trap works on the principle that when the bait is taken a weight falls on the prey. This live animal trap can be made to any size. Prop a weight up with a stick with some food attached by a string to the stick propping the weight up. when the animal takes the bait the weight will drop and either leave your animal looking alot like road kill or just imobilise it. let's hope for the latter.\n\nBox Trap\n\nA box trap is a very good trap for small game and birds.\n\nTo construct a box trap assemble a box from sticks tied together or whatever appropriate material that's available. Make it big enough to hold the game you intend to catch.Take time to make a trigger that fits well, like some string attached to the door and the bait. This will then force the door shut and some yum inside.\n\nSnare Trap\n\nUsing snares to trap animals is a simple method. Especially if you want to catch rabbits and small animals.\n\nMake sure the noose is large enough to pass freely over the animal's head. Set it at a height that's equal to the height of the animals head and a hand's width from an obstruction. Anchor securely.\n\nJust remember to leave yourself downwind from the animal, follow their tracks to watering holes etc, be patient and practice as much as you can.\n\nI will leave fishing down to you\n\nI will also leave gutting the animal to you, as much fun as it is you can work it out.

I've tried to include here the wisdom I have gained from making lots of hoops.  I use the tools that I've found in my mum's garage, as you may not have the same tools, I've tried to suggest possible alternatives.", "title": "Hula Hoop, UK Style", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Hula-hoop-UK-style/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "*MDPE water pipe\nThis blue tubing comes in 25mm and 20mm diameters.  You can get it from DIY stores like Wickes or Screwfix. Unfortunately the smallest length it comes in seems to be 25 metres.\n25mm tubing is good for adult hoops. I use 20mm tubing to make lighter hoops for more experienced hoopers, for hand hooping and for children. \n\n*Connector\nThis is the part I've had most problems with. You want something that fits snugly into the water pipe, so that the join won't come apart. You also want something strong which won't break. For the 25mm piping I have found that a short piece of 20mm piping makes the best connector, but clearly it isn't worth buying 25m of pipe to make a 10cm long connector.\nAn alternative is to use \"pipe inserts\" which are little tubes with a ridge round one end. These are designed to strengthen the pipe at joints and therefore fit very well in the pipe. They are usually available from the same places where the piping is sold. I use these for hoops made with 20mm pipe.\nYou might also come across something else that can be used as a connector. Fancy Tapes sell barbed connectors, but I haven't tried these. For 25mm piping you need a connector with an outside diameter of around 20mm, for 20mm piping you need a connector with a diameter of around 15mm.\n\n*Heat source\nTo get the connector into the pipe you usually need to heat the pipe. I use a hot air (paintstripping) gun, but hot water, a fan heater or some other source of heat will probably work just as well.\n\n*Glue\nSometimes a connector will stay in place just from using heat, but not always. I therefore use glue. Most glues won't work with the polyethylene which the piping is made from. The only glue I have found that does work is Loctite Super Glue All Plastics.  \n\n*Pipe cutting device\nI use a copper pipe cutter to make a groove in the pipe and then slice through with a stanley knife. I used to use a hacksaw, but this leaves a rough surface at the pipe ends which needs to be filed or sanded down. You can also get a special tool to cut plastic pipes.\n\n*Duct tape\n\n*Scissors\nFor cutting the duct tape.\n\n*rag or cloth\nFor wiping up glue\n\n*secateurs or file\nIf you are using a pipe insert as a connector, you will need to either cut or file off the ridge round one end of the pipe insert.

Cutting the ties round the coil and giving it some time to expand to about the same size as you want the hoop may give a rounder hoop. Often the end of the coil will be straight, so for a round hoop it may also be a good idea to cut off and discard a small section(around 20 cm) from the end\n.\nMost people find that the bigger a hoop is, the easier it is to hula hoop with. It is usually recommended to have a hoop that comes somewhere between your navel and your chest if you hold it up against you with one edge on the ground.\n\nIf you know the exact diameter of the hoop you want, you can work out how much pipe you need and measure it off, though you may need help with holding the tape-measure. I usually form the hoop from the end of the coil, and adjust it until I get the size I want, to work out where to cut the pipe.\n\nTo cut the pipe I use a pipe cutter (designed to cut copper pipe)  to make a groove in the pipe, then cut the pipe with a sharp craft knife. The pipe cutter squashes the hoop near the cut, which might make the tube fit more closely round the connector.\nYou can also use a hacksaw.

It doesn't have to be too neat, some rough edges help the connector grip to the inside of the piping.

Apply the primer to half of the connector. If you are using a pipe insert its better to start the half with the cut-off rim as this may grip the inside of the tube better. Apply the primer to the inside of one end of the tubing. I sometimes mark this with the marker so that I know which end I have done.\n\nWait for a minute (according to glue instructions), then apply glue to the primed half of the connector.\n\nIf the end of the connector doesn't slide into the end of the pipe, heat the pipe - a few seconds with a heatgun usually does the trick. Don't use to much heat to start with - ideally you should need some force to get the connector into the hoop. Once I have the end of the connector in the pipe I press it the free end of the connector down on a table to get it further in. This is where having a centre-mark on the connector can be helpful.\n\nIf you are unlucky, you might push the connector in too far. In this case you might be able to pull it out with pliers. If you have end up with less than 15mm of connector sticking out, then it's better to cut off the part with the connector in off and start again, as otherwise the join is quite likely to come apart. I find 20mm pipe inserts are the worst for this happening  - the ones I have been using are quite short.\n\n I usually wait for the glue to dry before repeating the process for the other end of the pipe. This is because I don't want the connector to get pushed further into the first end of the pipe when I'm trying to push the second end on. At this point it is a good idea to make sure that nothing has fallen inside the hoop. It can be quite annoying to have something rattling in your hoop. Unless you want a rattling hoop, in which case, this is the time to put rattling items in the hoop.\n\nYou might find that once the second pipe-end is on the connector, is is quite difficult to get it to move along so that the ends join up. To get them to join hold the hoop vertically with the join between your left and right hands, and the bottom of the hoop on the ground, then push the joint up and down. This looks rather strange, and its quite slow and hard work, but I guarantee the ends of the pipe will slowly move towards each other. The other thing you can do is wrap some tape (the more scrunched up the better) around the hoop on either side of the join to give a better grip when you push the ends together.\n\nAfter waiting for the glue to dry, you can test the join by trying to pull it apart. If I'm feeling brave, I put my foot on one side of the hoop and tug at the other end of the join. If the join doesn't hold, glue it again!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHA/XO9E/G5LEJVF8/FHAXO9EG5LEJVF8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWV/4S7R/G5LEJVF7/FWV4S7RG5LEJVF7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Connecting the Hoop - Inserting the Connector"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Wrap duct tape around the join.

If the connector is broken, cut off the section of pipe attached to the connector and put in a new connector (this will obviously make the hoop a little smaller) .\n\nHopefully you will have a nice round hoop, but sometimes it can be a bit wonky. This can also happen if you leave a hoop beside a radiator or squashed into a cupboard. If the hoop is not flat, place it on a flat surface and put something heavy (books are good) on the parts which lift up for a few hours. If it is not very round, you can try squashing the hoop to reshape it a bit.\n\nIf you want you can use tapes, or anything else you can think of to decorate your hoop. Decorating the hoop not only makes it look nice, it also improves the grip and makes it easier to hoop. Whatever you decorate your hoop with needs to be tough. However, if your hoop is looking a bit shabby, you can always put on more tape, or take off the old tape and put on new (WD40 is helpful for getting old stuff off).\n\nHappy hooping!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBQ/OMGB/G5LEJVGS/FBQOMGBG5LEJVGS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Hoop Care"}], "channel": "Sports"}, {"category": "Outside", "description": "You need a cup,cheesecloth,knife for this step.", "title": "HOW TO MAKE a BLACK SAND WATER FILTER", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Cut-small-hole-at-bottom-of-cup-and-add-cheeseclot/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F36/MW5L/I9UDR5RD/F36MW5LI9UDR5RD.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Grind Some Charcoal"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9N/4TRD/I9UDR5S5/F9N4TRDI9UDR5S5.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Dump Charcoal in Filter Cup"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0L/ZX49/I9UDR6IP/F0LZX49I9UDR6IP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Add Sand"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJA/6O3K/I9UDR73W/FJA6O3KI9UDR73W.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Put Cheesecloth Over It"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWW/3YI1/I9UDR7HS/FWW3YI1I9UDR7HS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Add Some Charcoal Again"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F15/HTTI/I9UDR96E/F15HTTII9UDR96E.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Then Sand"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "A link to our website that explains it all.\nhttp://blacksandfilters.weebly.com/our-filter-design.html", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FV4/KQGC/I9UDR9IO/FV4KQGCI9UDR9IO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Finally Put Cheesecloth at Top of Cup, Filter Is Done Enjoy:)"}], "channel": "Water"}, {"category": "Outside", "description": "follow the video", "title": "Butterfly Timing", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Butterfly-Timing/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "thanks for watching", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Let Me Know What You Think!"}], "channel": "Water"}, {"category": "Outside", "description": "Combination beginner and intermediate of butterfly knife (balisong) moves, easy to follow instructions on how to do each move.\n\nHopefully I helped :D\n\nLink to the video incase the embedded doesn't work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaEyz2cygSQ", "title": "Beginner/Intermediate Butterfly Knife Combo", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/BeginnerIntermediate-butterfly-knife-combo/", "steps": [], "channel": "Knives"}, {"category": "Outside", "description": "Here it is!

I have been experimenting with homemade stove designs for quite a while, everything from cat-food cans to altoids tins to pepsi cans to sobe cans.\nI wanted to come up with a design that fixed what I thought were shortfalls that the tin-can designs didn't allow me to do. Namely, I wanted everything to fit snugly inside my cook pot, including stove, pot stand, windscreen and fuel (for at least two nights).\nThe overall design of the double walled pepsi can stove worked for me, but I wanted it to be a bit bigger to hold my fuel bottel (I use a 4 oz nalgene squeeze bottle for most weekend trips)\nSo... I set about to come up with something... went through many iterations with many problems (Durability, fuel leaks, etc) and came up with this.\nThis is my first instructable, I'd certainly welcome any feedback that anyone might have.\n\nWhat you need to get busy on this project:\nAluminum Flashing (I got 10' x 6\" flashing from the Home Despot for like 6 bucks or so\nAlcohol.

Um... pretty self explanatory, right?\nFinally... use a zip-tie to make that important second connection to the sharpie. I found that in practical use, the sharpie tended to flop around a bit when only held in place by the spoke.\n\nThis is an infintely adjustable little handy-dandy way for making circles.\n\nUnfortunately I cut mine a bit short... you'll see more as we go through.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNZ/7JT6/GVLET2JYMVP/FNZ7JT6GVLET2JYMVP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM5/M4XY/PP3ET2JYMNA/FM5M4XYPP3ET2JYMNA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBH/5DCK/6F2ET2JYOAO/FBH5DCK6F2ET2JYOAO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: First... the Instructable Within an Instructable...

Then of course I threw it away when I was done making the first incarnation of this stove\n\nSo step 1 for me was:\nDig the template out of the trash, un crumple it... and prepare to document the instructable.\n\nI measured the diameter of the bottle I wanted to fit inside. It was somewhere around 1 7/8\" (inches). I figured a 2\" center hole would work for me.\n\nThat being said, I had the final design already in my head, so I knew that the center hole would be surrounded by a burner ring of about 1/4\" thickness, and I wanted the sides of the stove to be about 1\" high.\n\nSO... to make a long story short, I needed an outer circle of about 4 1/2\" diameter, and an inner circle of about 3 1/2\" diameter for the base. So that's what I drew. On the template. With my pencil compass. (Not pictured)\n\nYou see where this is going, right? I transferred the dimensions to the new Homemade Sharpie-Based Compass and drew these circles right onto the flashing. Using the scissors, I cut along the outer circle and voila...(Or viola... if you're musically inclined) I had a circle. With a circle in the middle.\n\nDISCLAIMER: PLEASE USE CAUTION WHEN CUTTING THE METAL. IT'S SHARP. DON'T CUT YOURSELF. PLEASE.\n\nNow comes the fun part:\n\nI eyeballed this, because I didn't have a protractor handy, and I didn't think it would make a heck of a difference anyway.

What you'll end up with here is a dodecagon (12 sided polyhedron) when you're done folding.\n\nThen, using the straightedge as a guide, fold each of the sides up.

It doesn't make circles less than about 2\" in diameter. So... in order to make the inner rings of the top, I went...yup, hunting around the shop for the proper diameter round things to trace.\n\nTurns out that the top of a baby food container (you've definitely got those in your shop...right?) is the right size for the middle circle.\n\nThe smallest of the three concentric circles really only needs to be about 1/2\" diameter smaller than the middle circle. We're just using it as a guide for cutting tabs to adhere to the center ring so it's not critical. Which is why you'll note in the pictures that I just traced around the outside of a lamp bulb holder thingie that I replaced recently, and eyeballed the middle circle.\n\nYou're going to want to cut out the inner circle with your sharp knife.

If you can't locate cedar shingles or they only come in large and expensive packages, see if you can find some long shims of a soft wood like pine or spruce. Shims have the advantage of already being in straight strips just wide enough for an arrow. I'm showing some bad examples along with good ones -- watch out for those knots and other irregularities in the wood! The main thing is to have a good solid strip of wood 12 to 18 inches long and a couple of inches wide, with one end at least pencil-thick but less than half an inch, and the other end very thin.

You can pin the pattern to the wood (hobby and art stores have pins designed for this sort of thing), but I just used a few pieces of tape. I salvaged a section of shingle that had a knot in one side and cracks in the thin end, placing the pattern on the good side and shortening the design a little with a Z-fold (taped down, see arrow).

If you want to have an expanded front end (for safety or style), you may need to start alternating direction once you get close enough to the shaft where a split might go through that part of the head. There should be no knots in or near the outline of your design, but a knot far enough to the side is not a problem. You might want to save carving the shape of the end of the tail for last.

Leave 1.5 to 2cm between them. This will allow the box to be centered when attached to the bike (and you can choose to mount it on the stem or on the handlebar).\nThe other 4 holes (red dots) is where you will pass the rubber band / elastic strip through. Put the GPS in the box and check for the best positioning of the rubber band. Remember its purpose is to keep the GPS secure, so you don't the holes to be too \"high\" on the box.\n\n2 - ( photo #2 ) Center the GPS inside the box and glue a few self adhesive felt pads to fill the space between the GPS and the box, thus helping to keep the GPS in place. ( My GPS has velcro on the back and it \"glues\" to the felt pads on the bottom of the box ).\n\n3 - ( photo #3 ) Use the zip ties to secure the box on the handlebar (or stem).\nYou may consider putting a piece of rubber or anti slid material between the zip ties and the handlebar to increase friction and absorb vibrations . This will help keep the mount in place. Make sure you test the mount orientation by putting the GPS in it and tilting the mount up or down to increase readability. When you find the optimal position, secure the zip ties.\n\n4 - ( photo #3 ) Cut the rubber band or elastic strip and pass it through the holes near the box rim. Tie a knot so it remains in tension. If you're using the elastic strip, you can use a locker instead (see photos on the original mount - 1st link in the text)\n\n5 - ( photo #4 ) Put your GPS in your new homemade mount and go ride around town :)", "title": "DIY Poor Man Gps Mount V. 2.0 for Garmin Geko", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-poor-man-gps-mount-v-20-for-Garmin-Geko/", "steps": [], "channel": "Bikes"}, {"category": "Outside", "description": "Miscellaneous small projects (mostly paracord) that I've found on here.

I wasn't keeping close track, but I think this cost about $500 to make. It came out at about 13 feet (the original tutorial called for a design 4 feet longer, but that was the most I could legally transport in my car), and weighs in around 40lbs. The sides and keel are made from Douglas fir, the bow, stern, and beams are made from hardware store pine, and the ribs are made of hardware store oak. Everything is fastened together with a combination of nylon twine and 1/4in dowels.\n\nLooking back, that initial shaping of the sides was freaky. I'd never bent wood like that before and just expected the whole thing to explode at any moment. It was surprisingly easy to bend the ribs; I'd never done it until I made this, and you might be surprised to hear that it can be done in your kitchen.

Will will try to post a couple more videos on painting the inside with boat enamel, building beds, installing a sink with a water pump, installing floor in a trailer or any other's you might want to see.\nWe have done four full gut trailers now each with it's own theme. Salon, Hot Rod, Bamboo, and teardrop.\n1966 Silver Streak Trailer *(Airstream Sister Trailer).\nThis trailer has had a full body-off restoration! The body was removed and the frame was reinforced and coated with POR-15. A new floor was installed and the underside was sealed. (FYI: This is the main problem with older trailers and by far the most expensive repair.)\nWith the three R\u2019s in mind (Reduce, Re-use, Recycle) we up-cycled a gym floor from an old Bally\u2019s Fitness athletic club. The floor was painstakingly removed one piece at a time and all nails removed. The gym floor was then installed to produce a modern sporty look.\nThe trailer was primed twice then sprayed with Epifanes Yacht paint to produce a high-gloss finish that you see on boats and yachts. (Not your typical paint job.)\nAn L-shaped sofa was custom made with large-hinged storage underneath. The back area is the size of a twin bed. The sofa pillows are indoor/outdoor material bought at IKEA.\nWe installed a new kitchen cabinet, sink and countertop. There is a hand-pump faucet with small water tank under the sink.\nThe front table is turned to have a view while enjoying a meal or could also be used as an office desk. There is plenty of space for a laptop and outlets nearby for charging.\nWhat more could you ask for?? A kegerator? Got it! Enjoy your favorite Northwest micro-brew in a Haier Brewmaster Kegerator (Full (1/2 barrel), 1/4 or 1 mini keg capacity)\u2026.Perfect for the typical NW beer-lover.\nThis trailer could not only be used for camping, but was designed with a backyard office studio in mind. Best of both worlds?...Your Welcome!\nFYI: We did NOT install a bathroom. (Our reason for this, is that with our camping experience, we have never used the toilets in the trailers\u2026it\u2019s gross. Most campgrounds with hook-up have nicer bathrooms available and should be used).

I will get her a roll of wax paper or a small container of coffee till we can go to the store for our weekly market run.\nI love tools and as a \"prepper\", got the idea of collecting things from the Dollar Store as part of my \"prepping\". The first article I bought was a hammer hanger. This is a piece of leather with a cut for a 2\" belt. There is a \"U\" piece of hardware, sticking out of the leather hanger at a 90 degree angle. You slip your hammer in it when you are out working on a job, and need to carry the hammer, till you need it. I modified the carrier to carry an ax I had bought for part of my survival kit. I shortened the \"U\" hardware so the ax was carried closer to my body. I then made a cover to cover the ax blade so it would not cut me while carrying. I had an old piece of leather so made the cover, put in a snap, tied it to the \"U\" bolt and there you go. Now I know folks may be saying that I could have BOUGHT a cover, surplus for about $3-5 dollars but then there is the shipping, etc. It would have cost me $10-15, by the time I received it in the mail. IF you don't have a piece of leather ( you can buy a bag of  scrap leather pieces from surplus houses) you could make the cover from cloth and sew on a button.\nThe second survival item I bought from the dollar store was a lighter. Now, I don't smoke but I carry a lighter in my daily survival gear carry. I have used a lighter maybe 3-5 times to thaw out frozen locks to get into my car during winter and also to get into our storage unit. I figure the $1 lighter definitely paid for itself...it lasted about 5 years, and YUP,... I got it at the Dollar Store. When that lighter was out of fuel,\nI found a refillable butane gas lighter available for $1, and a container of fuel for $1. So for $2,.. I carry about a years supply of butane fuel and a lighter...(see photo). Note, I wrapped the lighter with duct tape...the lighter was VERY PINK...and I am such a macho guy ( lol) that the duct tape covers the pink, while giving me about 1ft of tape to carry.\nI did more thinking about getting items from the Dollar Store or similar discount houses. I have made up survival kits that contain 24 items for about $79. Now obviously not all of these items are $1 dollar items, but they are supplied to discount houses by wholesalers......SO,. if you buy Dollar Store type items, you can get a sleeping bag for < $20, as well as a tent, etc........My kits cost about $79....if I bought GI surplus the items, tent, sleeping bag, knives, etc, would cost $500-1,000...\nTry your Dollar Store and similar discount stores in your area. You won't want to conquer Mt Everest with this gear, but its cheap enough to have several kits..1.in your vehicle, 1 at work, at home, at your retreat....should you not be able to get to one kit, you can fall back to the Dollar Store.

NOPE, they target my junk drawer and the small things I always seem to need but can't find.... \"I swear I remember putting it the drawer last honey, I know i did!\" Duh! Anyhow...\n\n HARBOR FREIGHT! Yep, there are 400+ stores nationwide so there is a chance one might be near you. They are like the \"Dollar Store for Tools\" type of place. Not bad prices, sure they could use better quality tools, but it has gotten me by in a pinch many a times!\n\n So here's the deal.....Every couple weeks Harbor Freight puts out a newspaper coupon flyer. TWO important coupons are on EVERY flyer...\n\n* A coupon for 20% off any SINGLE item (not bad)\n* A FREE ITEM coupon. FREE! FREE! FREE! (Very very good!)\n\n So take for example that picture of the .99 nylon rope, use the 20% off coupon (NICE!) and then use the FREE coupon for your gift. Done. You spent basically 80 cents on the rope and got a free flashlight, or whatever they offer that week.\n\n Now most times I usually need some sort of item around the garage, whether it be a bungie cord, some sort of fastener or whatever. Harbor Freight is great for this sort of thing. So my wife and I will each have our coupons and we make our seperate purchases....\nYes it is a predetermined gift for that week, but it is still free and usually it is an item we could use extras of.  \n\nExamples of the free gifts:\n\n*** FREE LED ALUMINUM FLASHLIGHT - This sucker is extremely bright, compact and they last a long time! They also come with FREE batteries. Not bad. I have these all over the house so we are PREPARED in case of an electrical blackout. Here on the Florida Coast it is common during storms. Bathroom drawers, desk, kitchen, closets, ALL OVER! I even use on as my mountain bike as a headlight!! You can hack it for the battery pack or the LEDs. I must have gotten more than a dozen of these flashlights for FREE!\n\n*** FREE MULTI-PURPOSE SCISSORS with STAINLESS BLADES - NO, they won't cut thru a leg bone but they sure are useful enough and being free we have several of these spread around as well. I can go cut something in the workshop, dull the blades, bend 'em, break them in half and not get in trouble for using my wife's FISKARS! Heck, you could even use them as throwing knives once they break apart to kill some zombies or use them in a trap as spear heads!!! One again... FREE!\n\n*** FREE MEASURING TAPE -Another item that never seems to be where ya' left it last. I know how the \"instructable family\" is always brain storming, lookin at stuff and going \"hhmmmm, can that fit there?\"... and extra measuring tapes thru-out the shop or house is a great thing to have. I am sure there is something to be made of old measuring tape steel. too...I just haven't gotten that far on this site yet! Hmm, gotta' go search that one! Uhhhh- yep its FREE!\n\n*** FREE SCREWDRIVER SET - Always a good thing to have in the junk drawer. This is a small handle set, more suited for small fixes around the house as opposed to screwing large wood screws and such. Cabinet hinges, electric work, puching holes in zombie heads.....FREE!\n\n So that's it. While you're out around town prepping for the zombie attack make sure to save those Harbor Freight coupons and take them up on these free items. Now I know someone might gripe about Harbor Freight and the quality of tools, especially if you grew up on Craftsman, Milwaukee and such....but certain tools just don't have to be a brand name to be good. Sure the gift is pretty much cheap and only cost them pennies, but it's free to you, what do ya' care?. Like I said, just use the coupon and purchase something really cheap...heck, even if it is a bag of zip ties! Get your 20% off and the free gift.\n\n...oh, if you do not recieve a weekly newspaper with coupons then you can always go to their website (harborfrieght.com), sign up and they will mail you their weekly flyer. Simple.\n\nGood luck out there!", "title": "PREPPING?
