[{"category": "Workshop", "description": "We'll be making a planter with a funny twist, because houseplants don't have to be boring. This Instructable is an entry to the Remix Contest, because I got inspired by the shampoo bottle monster pencil holder from Bianca Barreto:\nMine is made from wood instead of a shampoo bottle. It's made mostly with hand tools, with the exception of an electrical jigsaw (see further). I'd like to point out that although the body of the monster is round, there is no lathe required. The process for making it is somewhat similar to coopering, the long lost art of making wooden barrels for wine, beer and other spirits. For the main body of our planter, I chose oak. Mainly because I had it at hand but also because it's quite durable, which means it doesn't rot easily. Of course, any other durable hardwood would do fine too. You could even get away with softwood if you meticulously coat the inside with a waterproof finish.\nIf you're new to hand tool woodworking, I suggest you take a peek at the YouTube channel of Paul Sellers. There you will find everything there is to learn: planing, sawing, chiseling etc. For this Instructable, I'll assume you already have some basic knowledge. Feel free to ask me anything in the comments. About this project, of course :-)\nWithout further ado, let's get building!", "title": "Friendly Monster Planter", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Friendly-Monster-Planter/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "As I mentioned earlier, I had some oak strips available (pic 1). These will become the so-called staves of the barrel. They are 2.5 cm (1 inch) thick and a little over 5 cm (2 inch) wide. This thickness might seem a bit excessive, but later on we'll shape the body and we need to remove a lot of wood without the body getting too thin and fragile. Using a crosscut saw (pic 2), all pieces are cut to 30 cm (almost 12 inch). This resulted in the stack you see in pic 3. After taking a good look at it, I decided to cut them all in half using a rip saw (pic 4). This will make it a lot easier to approximate a cylinder, since the facets will be narrower and will require less shaping to get a round object.\nNext, plane all the inside and outside faces of the staves (pic 5) and choose how they will go together (pic 6). Mark them with a triangle to establish their order. Try to pay attention to grain direction. Now we're ready to join them into a barrel shape.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQQ/VLZB/JJEK2345/FQQVLZBJJEK2345.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYF/QMI9/JJEK234J/FYFQMI9JJEK234J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLJ/OKBB/JJEK236Q/FLJOKBBJJEK236Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW7/ITXL/JJEK237D/FW7ITXLJJEK237D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FII/0IVO/JJEK238X/FII0IVOJJEK238X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUF/FUII/JJEK239R/FUFFUIIJJEK239R.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Dimensioning Your Lumber"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "This step is where the magic happens. If you were to make a panel, you would plane all the edges square before gluing up. But here we will plane the edges at an angle on purpose (pic 1 and 2). At what angle you say? It depends on the radius you want. In my case the angle is about 5\u00b0 off from 90\u00b0, so 85\u00b0. Regardless of the angle you choose, it's a good idea to set your bevel gauge to that angle (pic 2), so that you get a consistent angle on every stave. Of course you need to plane both edges of each stave at that angle. The outside part of the stave should be wider than the inside part. Picture 3 shows that with just 3 staves, you already see the beginning of a curved surface.\nContinue planing all staves at an angle on both sides. Test each stave against the previous one to test the fit. I find it best to create two halves first, and then later glue those halves together. Before the glue up, you can wrap rubber bands around the staves to test the fit and get an idea of the diameter (pic 4). To glue up one half, use painter's tape to connect the staves on the outside (pic 5). Then apply glue (pic 6) and add more tape and rubber bands to hold everything together until the glue is dry (pic 7). Repeat to make the other half and leave both halves to dry for about half a day.\nYou'll notice the two halves won't exactly fit together. You can make corrections by planing the edges at the correct angle (pic 8). Test the fit regularly while doing this. Once you're happy that both halves fit together nicely, apply glue to the edges and clamp everything up (pic 9). And tadaaa, you made yourself a barrel.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F25/TYM7/JJEK49EW/F25TYM7JJEK49EW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTJ/ALQ0/JJEK49F5/FTJALQ0JJEK49F5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWL/I6EZ/JJEK49FE/FWLI6EZJJEK49FE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJX/WP9T/JJEK49G2/FJXWP9TJJEK49G2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTF/F53K/JJEK49GH/FTFF53KJJEK49GH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC4/E5F7/JJEK49H4/FC4E5F7JJEK49H4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCM/9RK6/JJEK49HJ/FCM9RK6JJEK49HJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAV/JQNN/JJEK49HK/FAVJQNNJJEK49HK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS6/KG8R/JJEK49I7/FS6KG8RJJEK49I7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Making the Barrel Shape"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "While the glue dries, we can start making a face and arms for our monster.

Take extra care when cutting out pupils and teeth. I would not recommend sawing out small pieces like this with a jigsaw if you're not experienced.

Keep planing down bottom and top, until you have a barrel-shaped object like in picture 3. Refine this shape further with a smoothing plane (pic 4), until you get rid off the roughness.

So let's add one. I found a scrap piece of oak that would do. Choose which side you want to be the bottom, and trace it with a pencil (pic 1). Cut it out with a jigsaw, and make sure to keep away from your line. It's a good idea to mark how the bottom corresponds to the body (pic 2), because chances are your planter won't be exactly round. Apply wood glue to the edge (pic 3), let it soak in a bit, apply some more and then clamp everything up (pic 4). We are gluing end grain to face grain here, so that's why the glue needs to soak into the end grain a bit.\nOnce the glue is dry, remove the hard edge with a sharp chisel (pic 5). This bevel will prevent the fibers from tearing out when you plane the end grain flush with the body (pic 6). Refine the bevel with your smoothing plane (pic 7).

The bottom edge is a bit sloppy, but that's fine because it won't be seen.\nChisel away the eye cavities as well (pic 4). Glue on teeth and pupils first, leave to dry, then glue everything to the body with clamps (pic 5).

Alternatively, you could either drill holes and put a scale under it, or you could fit a plastic pot on the inside. Next, fill the planter with regular potting soil (pic 2).\nAs for the plant, I chose a very easy to keep house plant called spider plant (Chlorophytum sp.) It grows in a wide variety of conditions. It spontaneously forms new shoots that easily take root, so it's very easy to propagate. Fun fact: this plant made NASA's list of air-purifying house plants. All plants produce oxygen, but the plants on this list also remove pollutants like formaldehyde from the air. Formaldehyde is a common pollutant in houses, originating from foam insulation, particleboard, fabrics and various other synthetic materials.\nAnyway, select a couple of shoots, cut them off (pic 3), plant them in potting soil (pic 4) and water them.

In fact, our fridge is exposed along its right side, since it is located at the crossroads of our house.

Instead of going through the work of making two complete doors, I opted for a simpler approach.

However at one point I realized that the drill press would make this way faster and since I'm usually making 20 pens at a time this is a great way to cut time down. However, using the drill press requires a little bit of finesse as it's powerful enough to chew right through the brass tubes.

I like the Easy Wood Tools square and circle cutters to do my pens and they're just amazing.\nNo matter how you do it, use your roughing gouge to start and get the blank to round. And then use the chisel of your choice to trim it down.\nYour goal with the carving is to get the ends flush with the bushings so that the hardware will fit. One other tip I have is that if you get a knot or a chip in the wood (as seen above), put a dab of CA thin glue in the hole and fill it with shavings. Don't worry, you'll sand it down later.\nYou can carve whatever shape you want, just make it pen-like. For a true slimline, make the blanks uniform from end to end. Or you can go fancy and make the bottom half a little fatter around the middle and tapered down. You'll just want to make sure that on the top half you make it mostly the slimline shape as the pen clip will ultimately go there and it needs to be uniform for that.\nOne other tip is to leave yourself a little extra wood on the bushing ends for sanding.

Probably around 800 rpm's. You can go faster, but you run the risk of burning your fingers. If your lathe has a reverse mode, use that for sanding as all your dust will fly backward.\nStarting at 150 grit, sand your pen blank down to get your final shape. You'll probably go through more 150 grit than any other grit in the pack. But it's important to make sure your ends are flush to the bushings and that you like your final shape.Once you're good with that, turn off the lathe and you'll be able to see the grit markings on the wood. To fix this you should now take that same grit and rub it cross-wise on the blank, slowly turning it until you get all the way around. This should get rid of the rest of your tool marks and your sandpaper scratches.\nRepeat for each grit up through 600.\nClean with denatured alcohol after 600 grit. I use a paper towel and wet it with the alcohol, then turning the lathe back on wipe it down. I usually do this 2 or 3 times. You'll be able to tell when you're done as you'll stop getting dirt and blackness on your paper towel.\nNext we'll wet sand with the micromesh. Get a cup of water and dip each pad in the water as you go. Keeping the lathe on, wet sand from the 1500 grit all the way up to the 12000, drying with a paper towel between each grit. No need to do the horizontal sanding with these.\nWhat we're doing here is that the water will raise the grain of the wood and then the sanding pad will sand it back down. This ensures a super smooth piece of wood.\nThe BLO and CA finish is a little hard to explain. We're doing one half at a time.\nWith the lathe on, put some BLO on a piece of paper towel and run it over the piece of blank. Run it back and forth, until the BLO is completely dried.\nThen place 3 drops of the thin CA on the paper towel over the spot where the BLO was. Run it back and forth over the same piece of wood, quickly, until it dries out as well.\nYou'll want to keep the paper towel moving the whole time or it might stick to the wood.\nRepeat for 3 -12 coats per piece. I usually stop at 4 but I've seen people who go up to a dozen. Completely depends on what kind of finish you want.\nIf you mess up the CA at any stage you can fix it by just starting over with the sanding at 150.

By using a relatively small value for the infill (around 20% for me) you can make surprisingly light yet strong pieces. This hollow infill will also make for a crushable area that can further protect the equipment inside from extreme shocks.\nI started this design when I still had a small 3D printer with around 4\" x 4\" x 4\" print area. All the pieces can be printed on a printer of this size except for some longer rail pieces. I've included shorter versions of those rails as well.\nIn this version the panels are 4 x 4 inches, the rails are generally 1 1/2 inches (finished dimension). By varying the number of panels you can get case sizes in factors of 4 inches. The panels come in 2 styles, \"male\" and \"female\", with the inner flat area either protruding slightly (approx. 1/16\") or recessed the same amount. By using these in opposition you can make the case more stackable, the panels on separate cases can register to each other like Tupperware.\nI will be updating and improving the pieces for this case over time, with the project posted here and on Thingiverse. However, with multiple copies of only 7 different pieces you can make the exact case you need.", "title": "Modular 3D Printed Hardbox", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Modular-3D-Printed-Hardbox/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "This version of the hardbox files are 4\" x 4\" panels, and 1 1/2\" corners and edges. This will allow for boxes in increments of 7\", 11\", 15\", 19\", etc. in each dimension. The box in these photos is 11\" x 15\" x 5 1/2\" deep. The box lid can be thin, as in the instructable, or built as the base with panels on the edges.\nThe panels are available in \"female\" and \"male\" variations, where the inset area in recessed (female) or extends (male). If the boxes built are meant to be stacked, alternating the female and male pieces will let them stack easily. Otherwise either panel type may be used. The male panels will be slightly stronger/thicker than than the female ones.\nTo make the box in this guide requires 34 pieces. Broken down that's 16 female 4x4 panels, 6 male 4x4 panels, 4 bottom corners, 4 opening corners and 4 shallow lid corners. In addition to box pieces you'll need hinges, handle, handle mounts and latches.\nImport the enclosed files to your favorite slicer program (i.e. Cura) and print as needed for the application. A \"light\" box can use settings of 20% infill, .175mm extrusion and 2 shell layers. Test higher (or lower) numbers to get the right amount of \"sturdy\". Even though those settings may seem very light, remember that the final case will be glued together with splice pieces in the slots. This construction will make the final case much more sturdy than any single piece right off the printer.\nThe exception to these settings however is for printing hinges, latches and the handle and its mounts. Print these pieces as strong as possible (100% infill) and positioned so the filament is extruded along the longest length runs, rather than the shortest as the perpendicular angle (to the filament extrusion direction) is weakest. Splice pieces will also benefit from being printed at 100% infill.\nThis box with the settings described require approximately 1.5 kilos of filament. I printed in PLA, but ABS would work fine and allow for acetone smoothing of the final assembled box. Don't acetone smooth before assembly as acetone vapor treatment shrinks the pieces and could wreck the dimensionality. Once an ABS box is fully assembled a very light touch acetone treatment would help the finish as well as sealing seams and improving the strength of the joints.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFK/PT6K/JTON1659/FFKPT6KJTON1659.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUG/2T2J/JTON168B/FUG2T2JJTON168B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCM/1KVV/JTON165Y/FCM1KVVJTON165Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F47/Y78F/JTON1607/F47Y78FJTON1607.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVR/KGMD/JTON17VI/FVRKGMDJTON17VI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT2/9D84/JTON17SJ/FT29D84JTON17SJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1H/U0LI/JTON162Q/F1HU0LIJTON162Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMU/AIZ9/JTON15XS/FMUAIZ9JTON15XS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3F/TSMB/JTON15W1/F3FTSMBJTON15W1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTC/XTZV/JTON15UB/FTCXTZVJTON15UB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE3/4U4F/JTON15SM/FE34U4FJTON15SM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8R/LDUE/JTON15R7/F8RLDUEJTON15R7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBT/T655/JTON15K3/FBTT655JTON15K3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIT/EAST/JTON15IP/FITEASTJTON15IP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5T/88QN/JTON15O5/F5T88QNJTON15O5.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Determine Required Box Size and Pieces to Print"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "It's important to test fit all pieces before gluing.

Dad and I went through a few ideas on how to construct them. However, before he had a chance to build them he passed away. My family said it was now up to me to carry on the woodworking tradition of the family. So with this I decided to take the ideas we had started with to make these advent calendars. The first couple I made I had some serious issues with the doors. How to hinge them... After trying to make custom ones with thin metal, using \u00bd\u201d steel dowels and modifying regular hinges, I finally came up with an idea that would work. I use long pieces of 1/8\u201d steel rod that run through the full height of the calendar going through holes in the doors. This may sound tricky, but it is actually quite simple.\nThe calendars are highlighted with a Christmas tree in the top gable area with a battery-operated tea light in behind to give a nice glow. My preference for wood is maple for the main case and Padauk for the doors and accent pieces. I like the Padauk for the main fact of having the red accent wood for Christmas. These house shaped advent calendars have now become quite a popular item on my online store. This is a project for intermediate to advanced woodworkers and requires patience and the proper tools. With the trial and error process that I worked through over the past year, I think I have worked out all the bugs to make these a sturdy and long lasting family heirloom.\nI have included the drawing plans with material list and templates for easy reference.", "title": "Wood House Advent Calendar", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Wood-House-Advent-Calendar/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "6 \u00bd\u201d x 12 foot rough 4/4 Maple wood (or any type of light coloured wood)\n6\u201d x 4 foot rough 4/4 Padauk wood (or darker accent wood of your choice)\n24\u201d x 24\u201d piece of 1/8\u201d hardboard\n5/8\u201d pre-cut wood numbers for the doors (Stockade.ca)\n25 \u2013 \u00bc\u201d x 1\u201d Wood Axel Pegs (Stockade.ca)\n5 \u2013 1/8\u201d x 12 5/8\u201d steel rod (Hinge Rods)\n25 - #4 thin Washers\n1 \u2013 Keyhole Slot Plug (Lee Valley #05H03.01)\n1 \u2013 Battery Operated Tea Light\nMaple Veneer (optional)\nGorilla Super Glue\nWood Glue\nHot Melt Glue Gun with clear glue\nClear Polyurethane Satin Finish\nDrill Press with Fence and stop block\nTable Saw\nMiter Saw\nRouter\n3/8\u201d Dado blade or router bit\n\u00bc\u201d Round-over Router Bit\n5/8\u201d Forstner bit\n1 \u00bd\u201d Forstner bit\nLots of Clamps", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQE/5P0F/JTMSHOKG/FQE5P0FJTMSHOKG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Materials & Equipment Needed:"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Prepare your parts for the main case, dividers and roof from maple.

The round-over allows the doors to open properly without the edge rubbing against the frames. It is easier to rout this round-over on the long strips than trying to do each door individually.\nSand the strips before cutting into length for the doors. Sanding before cutting takes away a bit of the work load when finish sanding the doors. Cut the doors to 2 3/16\u201d long on the miter saw. Make sure you put the square side of the doors to the miter saw fence and have a zero clearance backerboard against the fence to prevent any tearout on the doors. Alternatively, you can cut your long strips 2 \u00bc\u201d wide then after the doors have all been cut you can trim each door down to the final width. This will skim off any tearout you may get. It is good practice to make several extra doors for test drilling the hinge holes later on.

For the case sides, you need to cut a 3/16\u201d x 3/8\u201d rabbit on each inside end of the sides and a 3/16\u201d x 3/16\u201d rabbit along inside back of each side and case bottom.

You may need to pull them apart after dry-fitting to make adjustments. The dadoes also need to be flush on the outer edges when put together. The drawings show the exact location of each dado.\nSelect the edges that you will want to have toward the front of the calendar. Flip over and mark the back sides. Since the dadoes are on reverse edges for the horizontal and vertical dividers, it will make it easier for cutting the proper side on the table saw. I prefer using my dado set on the table saw as each groove can be done in one pass. If you prefer to use your router, and have a long enough 1/4\" straight router bit, you will need to cut in increments.

These will be done on the horizontal dividers only and the top and bottom pieces. Placement of these holes is key and must be accurate to ensure the rods go straight through the case. For the top and bottom pieces, the holes will be 3/16\u201d deep. I go to my drill press for this job and utilize my fence and a stop block. The holes are 3/16\u201d from the front edge of the dividers and top and bottom pieces. The left side holes are 3/8\u201d from outside edge and the subsequent holes are 3/16\u201d to the right of the divider dadoes. Set your fence so that the center of the bit is 3/16\" from your fence. I designed a template from 1/8\u201d hardboard for this but it can easily be done by marking the center of the holes on each piece. If you plan on making more than one you may want to make a template or a jig to speed up this process. I drill each divider individually so the bit doesn't move or bend making the lower board holes crooked. You can mark and drill one, then use that piece as the template for marking the other dividers and top and bottom pieces. You can mark with a pencil, but I like to use the same size brad point drill bit and tap it lightly with the hammer through my template holes to give an indentation for the center. Another method I have done is by using my stop block. I mark one divider only, set my stop for the first hole and drill all the dividers and top and bottom pieces individually, then set the stop block for the second hole and repeat until all holes are drilled. This ensures ever hole is identical.\nFor the five hinge rods, I purchase 1/8\" steel rod in 48\" lengths from one of the home improvement box stores and cut it to length with my hack saw. The steel rods are the same lengths as the dividers, 12 5/8\".\nOnce the holes are drilled it would be a good time to do a dry fit. Assemble the dividers together. Just as a note, I don\u2019t glue them together as I try to keep them as snug as possible, so once your done dry fitting you can leave the divider assembly together, depending on how tight your fit is. When assembling you will need to clamp the dividers within the side pieces and clamp the top case piece in place, leaving the bottom off. Push your 1/8\u201d steel rod up from the bottom through each line of holes to see if they line up properly. You can use a small rasp or your 9/64\u201d drill bit in your hand drill to make the holes a bit bigger in any direction to ensure everything is going in straight. If the holes are slightly bigger than the 9/64\u201d it won\u2019t affect how the doors open.\nOnce you are satisfied you can glue up the case. Remember, don\u2019t glue on the bottom piece on yet. It needs to stay off to install the doors. Glue your dividers together first if required. Apply glue to the top edges of the divider assembly and clamp on the case top ensure front is flush. Let dry for about half an hour. Then repeat this process to attach both sides, applying glue to the dividers and end dadoes of the sides. Make sure front side is flush and the entire case is square. This is going to require a lot of clamps. When dry, remove from clamps and clean up any glue squeeze out. Sand joints and front of case with 220 grit paper as required.

Insert a 9/64\u201d drill bit into the drill press with about 1 \u00bc\u201d of the bit sticking out. This will help keep the bit straight while drilling. Also ensure your drill press bed is square to your bit and fence. Set up your fence on your drill press so the bit is lined up in the exact center of the door thickness. Next set up a stop block so your bit center is 3/16\u201d from the hinge side (rounded side) of the door. Make sure you have a few pieces cut the same size as your doors to run some test drilling. When you are perfectly lined up put your first door against the fence with the outside of the door facing out. You can only drill about halfway through the door at a time then you will need to flip it over and drill from the opposite end. If you try to go through the entire height of the door, the bit will usually go off on a bit of an angle. Drill the hole in increments. Only go in no more than \u00bc\u201d at a time, pull the bit out, clean off any material stuck on the bit, then continue drilling gradually until you are just past halfway of the door height. Trying to do too much at once causes the bit to heat up too much and can crack the wood. I like to keep a stiff paint brush handy for cleaning the bit. Now you need to flip your door over ensuring you are keeping the bit on the hinge side of the door. The inside of the door should now be facing you. Repeat the process as you did on the other side only drilling small amounts at a time. Continue until all 25 doors are drilled. To ensure the holes are straight and cleaned out well, I like to put the drill bit into my 12v cordless hand drill and ream the holes running the bit through the entirety of the hole. If you are slightly off angle with the holes you can use the bit to lightly ream them.

I used a piece of \u00bd\u201d MDF about 3\u201d x 12\u201d and drilled 5 \u2013 \u00bc\u201d holes in a row, about 2\u201d from the bottom. Spacing isn\u2019t important.

You may need to do a light sand of the case 45 angles at the top, and the outer gable edges and back panel to ensure they are smooth.\nNow you can glue on the roof assembly. Make sure the front of the roof is flush with the case front the the area that was taped during spray finishing is at the back. Apply glue along the angled edges of the gable and the angled corners on the top outside edges of the case. Clamp together making sure the entire assembly stays flat. Because the roof gable wants to pull up, make sure you clamp the gable and calendar case to your work bench to hold it down and keep it flat. Put a 1/16\" piece of scrap wood under the gable area before clamping to your bench as the back panel is recessed 1/6\".", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F51/YICV/JTON1V1K/F51YICVJTON1V1K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3B/FVOB/JTON2C0U/F3BFVOBJTON2C0U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB3/INS0/JTON2C0V/FB3INS0JTON2C0V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGI/CC2S/JTON2C0W/FGICC2SJTON2C0W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI3/KAI3/JTON2C1U/FI3KAI3JTON2C1U.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 15: Attaching Roof Assembly"}, {"step": 16, "steps_text": "While the case is drying you can cut the roof facia scallop pieces for the front of the roof edges. Cut 2 pieces from Padauk, \u00bc\u201d x 1\u201d x 11 7/8\u201d long. Cut 45 degree angles on one end of each piece. Print 2 copies of the attached drawing plans for a scaled template for the facia pieces. You can either use spray adhesive to attach the template to the wood or trace it out. The paper can easily be removed after cutting and a light sand removes any gum residue from the glue. Cut your scallops on the band saw or scroll saw and finish sand with 220 grit paper. An oscillating sander with a 1 1/2\" spindle makes sanding quite simple. Glue and clamp to front edges of roof ensuring pieces are even and line up straight at top. Leave an overhang on the flat side about 1/16\u201d past the roof. Make sure the facia doesn't block the top corner doors from opening properly.\nTIP: Depending on my material, I often cut the facia from a wider piece of stock, cut the scallops and sand the entire piece. Then I rip my 1/4\" pieces on the table saw. When cutting this way, it is safer to leave the one end square and cut the 45 degree angle after the individual pieces are cut. This makes it safer to rip giving you a square end to use a push block on the table saw.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBG/AV6T/JTON1VCJ/FBGAV6TJTON1VCJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F18/3RE0/JTON1VEW/F183RE0JTON1VEW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZK/P62N/JTON2PO4/FZKP62NJTON2PO4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVP/X0NN/JTON2PW7/FVPX0NNJTON2PW7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDY/2O0B/JTON2PXU/FDY2O0BJTON2PXU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 16: Roof Facia"}, {"step": 17, "steps_text": "To cut the Christmas tree for the top you will need some of the accent Padauk wood with maple accents. Or you can do in reverse with a maple tree with Padauk accents. Prepare your piece for the tree to around 3/16\u201d thick. You will use the attached plans again for the scaled template for the tree. Cut out the tree on a scroll saw (my preference) or band saw with a fine blade and sand to smooth all edges. Now you will cut some 1/8\u201d thick, or less, pieces of maple for the garland using the template to mark them on the maple. Cut with scroll or band saw. If you don\u2019t want them too thick you can use 1/16\u201d maple veneer and cut with a utility knife or scissors. If you pick up some pre-glued veneer edging you can attach by ironing on. Glue the garland to the tree with Gorilla Super Glue. This part doesn\u2019t have to be exact to the plans. Feel free to be inventive. Drill a number of 1/8\u201d holes through the tree between the garland. This allows a bit of the light from the tea candle to glow through giving the appearance of ornaments on the tree.\nThere are other options for the decorative accent for the candle holder. Ready made wood cutouts can be purchased through various online stores like Stockade.ca. They have numerous Christmas options, i.e. Christmas trees, Reindeer, Wreaths\u2026 Remember these will be done in a white wood, so if you want the Padauk wood you will have to cut them yourself.\nTo hold the candle, cut a piece of maple to the size specified in the cut list. Using a 1 \u00bd\u201d forstner bit, drill a hole in the center of the piece. This can go all the way through or not, depending on the depth of your tea light. Ensure the tea light you purchase will fit in the hole. I have had issues with them being a bit too large. Glue the candle base to the bottom back of the tree ensuring bottoms are flush.\nOnce your tree/candle holder is dry, scrape out any glue squeeze-out, lightly sand and apply 2-3 coats of polyurethane. Finish sand the tree/candle holder prior to attachment. Attach with the Gorilla Super Glue in the center of the roof gable area.

I was in need of additional ports for a third external drive, a printer, and then of course jump drives. I searched around online, but everything I liked was an overpriced aluminum strip or block, which would just clutter up desk space. It's bad enough that I'm spatially taunted by a random drink coaster ... wait a minute ... I can combine two annoying things into one useful thing.\n\nIt just so happened that a concrete USB hub challenge was taking place on YouTube (circa 2016), which resulted in many creative designs:\nLawing: Desk orgainizer/holding thingy\nJackman: Electronic device storage shelf\nKage: Side table\n\nAt first, the idea of concrete was of no interest to me, but further contemplation swayed my opinion. A concrete coaster would be impervious to both hot and cold beverages and the weight would keep it from dancing around while inserting cables and drives. Also, it could be used to bludgeon zombies once the apocalypse happens.\n\nFor shape, I decided to go with a shallow block - just thick enough to encapsulate the USB hub.\n\nFor the actually Hub, I chose a 7 port octopus (octopod?) style. I guess the male connector counts as the 8th arm? This style allows me to distribute the ports across three sides of the block.\n\nFor design, I decided to try an epoxy inlay ... in the shape of an 8-bit skull.", "title": "The 8-Bit Skull Concrete USB Hub", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/The-8-Bit-Skull-Concrete-USB-Hub/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The key to concrete casting, aside from an adequate mix, is a quality form.

I happened to have some melamine left over from when I made my large router/assembly/outfeed table.\n\nI sliced a length from the larger sheet using a circular saw and shop made saw track. I further reduced this using the miter saw and then cut my final parts using the table saw. A sharp blade and applying painters tape within your cutting path will greatly minimize melamine chip out.\nBottom: 5 1/2\" x 5 1/2\"\nSides: 9\" x 2\".\n\nIn true BALES fashion, I obsessively laid out screw locations on the four sides. They don't need to be perfectly spaced since this is just a form, but that's how my brain works. Holes were drilled using a countersink bit and then a 1/8\" bit. Within one of the sides, I drilled a recess for the male connector of the USB hub [Fig. 7]. This will keep that part outside of the final concrete cast.\n\nI assembled the form on a flat surface and even used a clamp to ensure the sides were flush. It's a good idea to label the side which will entomb the male USB connector, so that during demolding, you don't pry on that side like a barbarian and destroy everything.

I was thinking about running out to get some angle steel, when I remembered the \u201cwaste\u201d material I had hacked out of the shelving frame. Bolting the steel I had cut out when liberating the longer sections across the rail joint provided the needed rigidity - looking down the assembled rails showed them to be dead-straight. Since I had fitted both the upper and lower rails with the aluminum, I left the aluminum in place on the lowers, as those won\u2019t have any vertical stress on them and may add some horizontal stability.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FH2/7G67/JTOMWQC8/FH27G67JTOMWQC8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHM/4P8S/JTOMWPIC/FHM4P8SJTOMWPIC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTM/BC0C/JTOMWPDP/FTMBC0CJTOMWPDP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Engineering"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The frame assemble with only the addition of two new holes, and used the original screws from the shelving unit, except to attach the stabilizing pieces, at the joint in the rails. Consideration for this part of the assembly was to have a completely flat surface on the top and inside of the upper rails, to not interfere with movement of the sled (more on that later).\nThe back side of the original unit was about four inches taller than the front, so one of the frames (bottom) ended up being longer than the upper. I could have trimmed the longer pieces; but thought that the added length might provide a little additional strength to keep from bending the frame due to the leverage amplified by long risers.\nI lined up the upper and lower (with the aluminum) frames to determine where to drill the holes for the risers, disassembled the frames and drilled holes on the drill press, working up to 3/8\".", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFH/Q8TP/JTOMWPRF/FFHQ8TPJTOMWPRF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Frame Assembly"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Since the shelving unit was built with the shelving unit inside the vertical components (now my horizontal rails), the shelf unit was sized to fall between the rails.\nI cut out the wire mesh between the cross members with the bolt cutter, filed them and then used two more of the remaining short cut-off sections from the disassembly for the ends of the sled. The distance between the long sides was measured to fit my router base well and allow freedom of movement.\nSince the long sides of the sled are the same width as the \u2018box\u2019 the ends of the sled will sit directly on the top rails of the box. To help reduce friction when the sled is on the box, I used thin strips cut from an old plastic cutting board (another thrift store find); it doesn\u2019t matter how thick these are, as long as they are the same. A plywood base was attached to the sides (only) and the plastic strips attached to the runners using epoxy and also screwed the plywood to the frame. I hit the plastic sliders with 220 sandpaper to remove any ridges allowing a smoother ride down the rails.\nThe sled was now ready for my router \u2013 almost. I have a 2\u201d flattening bit for my router, with a 2\u201d shaft extension. I didn\u2019t want to modify one of my factory parts for the router so made a sub-base specifically for this bit. From the same cutting board, I cut a square to fit the router diameter, then cut a 2\u201d hole through the base with a hole saw on the drill press. This is an easier task in concept than execution, as the plastic melts and gums up everything pretty quickly. This melting property actually turned out to be a benefit, as the 2\u201d hole turned out to be a bit larger \u2013 enough to accommodate the 2\u201d bit without interference. You\u2019ll need to do a little clean-up on the hole to remove the solidified plastic blobs, a knife, file and sandpaper do the job in short order. I left this base square to keep it from twisting on the sled \u2013 I don\u2019t know if this is helpful or not, the router will stay in it\u2019s orientation; but, I won\u2019t be able to turn it for comfort during use, it\u2019s a matter of preference I suppose..\nOh, and there\u2019s another thrift store treasure. I picked up this adjustable light for $4 and clamped it to the bench between the drill press and bench band saw. It swivels and adjusts to work for both.\nI\u2019m not overly concerned with seeing the router working the wood for this application, so the opaque plastic and plywood sled are OK here. There\u2019s a big slot in the sled to see what has happened, and this is not detail work.\nHere, I'm going to jump ahead a little, while we're talking about the sled build... During the first couple of test passes with the system, I noticed the upper frame was spreading outward in the center. This was fixed by attaching angle aluminum to the sled, to keep the lateral forced from dropping that 2\u201d flesh destroyer, unexpectedly. The overhang is just enough to keep the sled on the tracks. I should probably mention the plastic runners work great for reducing friction, the sled will slide from one end of the box to the other with just a 12 inch incline \u2013 waxed rails don\u2019t hurt either.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYN/X59I/JTOMWQIJ/FYNX59IJTOMWQIJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL9/1BXP/JTMT0SZ7/FL91BXPJTMT0SZ7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLE/KDDI/JTMT0T0U/FLEKDDIJTMT0T0U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWE/H0MP/JTMT0T3M/FWEH0MPJTMT0T3M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ2/KH01/JTOMWQ11/FZ2KH01JTOMWQ11.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Building the Sled"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "I purchased two six foot 3/8-16 threaded rods for use as the risers. Initially, I had planned for four 2\u2019 risers (on the corners only). After assembly and putting the weight of the router onto the sled, I decided to put another set of risers at the joint of the horizontal sections (the middle) to eliminate potential sag. (It\u2019s inevitable that at least some body weight is going to provide some additional downward force). I cut four 1\u201d x 3\u201d pieces from some old steel framing brackets I had from a deck project. These were drilled to attach to the frame reinforcements in the middle of the rails on one end and to fit the riser rods on the other ends. These sit outside of the main frame to all the sled to move the entire length of the box without interference.\nI used hex nuts and washers to attach the risers to the lower frame and out-riggers (one nut and washer set below and one set above) \u2013 tight but not crushing, and a set of wing nut and washer above and below the rail frame on each riser for height adjustments and leveling when the system is being set up to use. The wing nuts at the top corners also serve as stops and keep the bit from coming in contact with the frame.\nAs mentioned previously, I had applied wax to the sled runners, I also applied a couple of coats to the upper frame rails to help things slide around more freely.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWG/EYB0/JTON05U6/FWGEYB0JTON05U6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV5/79M3/JTON05PP/FV579M3JTON05PP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Risers"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "For demonstration purposed for this Instructable, I went out to my wood pile to grab a log to work.

This process makes a big mess!\nThe log I chose was ~2\u2019 x 10\u201d and had been cut long enough ago that it was starting to show some evidence of deterioration. Before doing anything with an expensive router bit, I used a draw knife to remove nearly all of the bark from the log \u2013 a couple of reasons for this, first to remove the potentially bit damaging crud that lives in bark (the draw knife is easy to sharpen) and second, to try to minimize the number of little critters living in the bark from being flung into all the hard to reach places in my shop.

I screwed together a couple of scraps to cradle the log and keep it from wobbling.\nAfter stabilizing the stock, you will need to lower the upper rails to just above where you will engage the wood with the router by spinning the lower wing nuts down (or up) to support the rails at the desired level. Use a long level to span across two points and lock those into place, tightening the upper wing nuts; then level the rest of the rails from there. It is important to make sure that all connections are tight, to minimize wobble and tilt - double check the riser feet and end bars, immobilizing each of these junctions. The set up presented here is surprisingly stable, even with the upper rails at the full two feet elevation.

I found I could cut about \u00bc inch at a time as long as I worked from the outside toward the center and taking \u00bd-1\u201d passes \u2013 not more than \u00bd the width of the bit. If you start out in the middle (like cutting a dado) you may run into some shifting and control issues, depending on your depth. I used the plunge base for my router, to let me make multiple passes on the log before having to adjust the risers and level the rails again.

It is because it is the first start of the motorcycle after rebuild and it still has to evacuate some humidity from the cylinder and the fogging oil I used into the cylinder ;)", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: The Project Video (timelapse)"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Before detailing each step of my Instructable, I wanted to tell you guys what you need to know in order to make a junkyard motorcycle run again: what do you absolutely need to check? how much does it cost? how \"easy\" is it?\nIf you find yourself with a junkyard bike, or a bike that hasn't run in many years, there are some key components that you'll absolutely need to go through in order to be able to ride it again:\n- Engine: Without an engine, you can't ride. You'll want to determine if the engine is seized (pistons can't move at all) or fine. If the engine is seized, you'll most likely have to rebuilt it and open it up, if not, you can probably just restart following the step I go through in the upcoming steps of this instructables.\n- Final Transmission: the final transmission is what will allow you to transfer the power from the engine to the rear wheels. Most of the motorcycles use chain, some do have shaft drives. If your motorcycle has a chain, best thing will just be to replace it, old chains are often corroded and damaged, and a new one will only cost around $25 to $50\n- Wheels & Suspension: this is a crucial part because they are the contact surface of your motorcycle to the road. On old bike that has been stored for decades, you'll have to change the fork oil and seals, it is not difficult to do and pretty cheap, about $10 for the seals and $15 for the new oil. As for the shocks, it is often better to replace them, but once again, you can find new replacement shock for just about any bike for under $100, so less than the price of having the old shocks rebuilt.\nFor the wheels and tires, most of the time, wheels will likely be fine, except for spoked wheel like on my 350 Four, which will probably be rusty and need to be replaced. Tires however will almost always have to be replaced, remember that a tire lifespan is 6years, even if the bike is not riding during that time (which is actually worse for a tire) because the rubber will harden causing slipping especially in corner. So never try to ride on old tires, always replace them, it is a matter of safety, and most of the time new tires will cost less than $150\n- Brakes: Finally, THE most important part on a motorcycle, its brake. On an old bike, it is always better to restore the brake, that is to say change the brake pads (or shoes for a drum brake) and change the brake fluid (it needs to be changed every 2 years because of humidity in it). You'll likely need to rebuild the master cylinder too with new seals, or maybe you'll just want to change it for new one. Brakes pad or shoes will cost around $20 per brake, brake fluid $10, and a master cylinder rebuild kit, or a new universal master cylinder around $50.\nOn disc brakes, it is also a good idea to replace the old rubber brake lines with new one, stainless steel brake lines are great upgrade and not too expensive.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F4H/C24R/JTOMX9YJ/F4HC24RJTOMX9YJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Preambule : What Does It Takes to Make a Motorcycle Run Again?"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "So, this is the bike I decided to save, the one in which I believed had a lot of potential!\nIt is a 1973 (I think from the chassis number) Honda CB 350 Four, the smallest one of the Honda CB Four series, it was only produced from 1972 to 1974 so it is not a very common bike.\nBut what liked about this bike was especially this! having a 350cc 4 cylinder is VERY uncommon, it's not something you see everyday and just a few models of such small 4 cylinder motorcycle were actually massed produced.\nThe bike condition:\nWhen I got the bike, it was pretty much a wreck, it didn't run for at least 30 years, so the engine needed to be fully inspected and restarted, it had no brakes at all, and overall, was in a terrible condition: corrosion everywhere, the gas tank had a lot of dents everywhere, the forks and shocks had no oil left at all inside them because they were leaking... so everything had to be rebuilt.\nThe motorcycle also shown many signs of crashs, so I believe a crash may have been the initial reason why this bike has been put away many many years ago. The speedometer had dents, the lower tripple clamp had a broken \"turn stopping part\" which can only happen in a nasty crash, and many parts were missing, like electrical compoments, brake parts, etc. So I believed people then came to pick up parts on this bike when it was stored.\nI could tell that the bike had not been run for a long period of time when I pulled the fuel petcock off the bike and oppened it, well first of all it broke, but inside of it,was a lot of solid dirt!! the gas that was once in the tank sat there for so long it turned into solid chunks of dirt!\nSo now that I got the bike, it was time to restore it, and my first goal was to make that little engine run again!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFL/V3DQ/JTMSYN6F/FFLV3DQJTMSYN6F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI4/QW9H/JTMSYN25/FI4QW9HJTMSYN25.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCY/ZT1V/JTMSYN3B/FCYZT1VJTMSYN3B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMC/2R2V/JTMSYN3C/FMC2R2VJTMSYN3C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU8/KTF4/JTMSYN2Q/FU8KTF4JTMSYN2Q.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: The Motorcycle to Be Saved"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Here we are, probably the most exciting part of this restoration: start the engine again. I actually wanted to try to restart an old engine for a very long time, it was a challenge I always wanted to take :)\nSo, when trying to restart an engine, it is crucial to know what actualy allows an engine to run! what does it need?\nWell it is actually pretty simple, it needs:\nFuel\nAir\nSpark\nFree moving parts (piston, crankshaft, etc.)\nLets start by the \"free moving parts\", it just means that the engine must not being \"seized\", aka the piston can move freely inside the cylinder, and others partks like the crankshaft are fine too. When I got the bike, I tried to gently crank it with the kickstarter and immediatly saw that it was not seized and that it could turn easily, so this part was good!\nThen, for the fuel and air, those 2 depends on the carburetor, it is the carburetor that will bring the correct fuel/air mixture to the engine, so the first step here was to entirely rebuild the carburetors.\nAnd finally, for the sparks: there are several component needed for a proper spark: spark plugs, plug caps, coils, points, condenser, etc. A single faulty part would cause no spark at all, and those parts are actually pretty cheap, so best thing is just to replace all of them, which I did (except for the coils because I tested them and they were still good).\nNow, let's start with the carburetor rebuild:\nThe 350 Four has 4 carbs, one for each cylinder, and any bike that sat for more than a year or two will need a full carb cleaning, and most likely rebuild too, because old gas tend to turn into \"gum\" and block the tiny ports. Moreover, old seals and O-ring will harden with time and cause leaks.\nFor rebuilding the carbs, I started by taking the 3 carbs aparts and down to pieces, removing as much parts as possible for better cleaning, there were a lot of aluminium oxyde inside the carbs, it was crazy!\nThen, I had the carbs ultrasonic cleaned, 6 times actually, ultrasonic cleaning is a very effective to clean carburetors. It's the best method I found so far.\nFinally, I put the carbs back together using a rebuild kit, that is to say new seals, o-ring, needles, jets, etc.\nThis alone took me a lot of time, you need to be very careful not to mix parts between the carbs and put them back in the correct order. I'd say that rebuilding the carbs alone probably took me 8 hours.\nLet's head back onto the engine:\nOkay so now that we have a correct air/fuel supply to the engine, we need a spark!!\nSo to get a proper spark, I start by removing the old points (aka. contact breakers) and condenser, they were so old the points did not made proper contact and did not allow current to pass through. If you are not familiar with points, it is what was used on old bikes before electronic ignition came around to determine when to trigger the spark on the cylinders. It is directly related to the crankshaft which tell the points were the pistons are in the cylinder.\nSo after replacing the points, it is crucial to set the ignition timing by turning the crankshaft to certain marks, which indicate certain positions of the pistons, and adjust the points accordingly. It is not a difficult task, you just need to be patient and have a static timing light. I actually made one with a 12v led and 2 alligator clips lol\nNow, before even trying to start this engine, it absolutely needed new oil, you can't run an engine that hasn't started in decades, which 30y/o oil. So I drained the old oil and changed the oil filter, then poured in some cheap fresh oil because I only planned to run the engine for 15min on that oil before changing it again! I also added some \"Engine clean\" oil additive to help remove dirt and debris from the engine.\nI then replaced all 4 spark plugs, installed new plugs caps and... we were good to go!!\nSo.. did it run?? I'd say watch the video and find out ;)\nSpoiler alert: It did!!\nTo make it start again, I hooked up a battery, fuel supply line to the carbs, and starting cranking it!\nI eventually restarted, with a TON of SMOKE!! it was crazy!! all the smoke was coming from the \"carbon goo\" inside the cylinders, the carbon had mixed with humidity and created a kind of goo, which had to be burnt off.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8W/F6V8/JTOMX9W6/F8WF6V8JTOMX9W6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA9/TZH7/JTIYMI3E/FA9TZH7JTIYMI3E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWW/86WS/JTIYMI3H/FWW86WSJTIYMI3H.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Breathe Life Into the Engine Again"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Restarting the engine was a first step... but to be able to ride a bike, you need to be able to sit on it, to transfer the engine's power to the rear wheel, and moreover, to be able able to stop it ^^ as Jeremy Clarkson once said: \"Speed has never killed anyone. Suddenly becoming stationary, that's what gets you\"\nSo we need proper suspension, final transmission, tires and, well, brakes!\nLet's start with suspension:\nThe old rear shocks were entirely corroded and spongy, best thing was just to replace them with new ones, and since I planned on making this bike a scrambler, I installed new, slightly longer shock that has compression and rebound adjustments for maximum comfort.\nAs for the fork, they were out of oil because of the damaged fork oil seals, so I pulled them apart, cleaned everything, changed the oil seals, and poured in fresh 15w oil. I used 15w grade oil because that's \"heavier\" than the old oil, so the benefits from heavier oil will be stiffer forks, which is always a nice benefit on those old bikes.\nNow, the transmission:\nThe final drive chain is what transfer power from the gearbox to the rear wheel. The old chain was just dead, plain and simple, plus someone, for an unknown reason, had remove the master link clip so the chain could just snap at any minute. So here again, the only option was just to replaced the chain, I also replaced the front sprocket during the process.\nHow about the tires?\nWould it be fine to ride a bike with cracked, hard, old tires and corroded rims and spokes? well, actually, no!!\nSo I also changed the rims, tires and spokes, aka. I re-laced the wheels. The only parts I kept were the wheel hubs.\nHere is a tip: if you want to change your spokes, rim and tire, you actually do not need to bother removing the tire and spokes, which can be pretty hard. You can just cut the spokes lol, you are going to ditch them anyway, this will make you save a lot of time!\nOnce you have just the wheel hub, you need to re-lace and true the wheel, it was the first time I did this, and looked for tutorials online. It is actually not very difficult to do, and does not require special tools, maybe just a spoke wrench. However, it does requires A LOT of time and patience. So my advice for this is just take your time, don't rush it, even if you are frustrated when truing the wheel, because once you mount the tire back on, it'll be a PITA to have to do everything all over again.\nFinally, the brakes!\nNow, the most important part! the CB350F has a rear drum brake, and a disc front brake, both of which did not work on my bike.\nThe rear brake was a pretty easy fix, the missing parts were only the spring & nuts that connect the brake rotor to the brake lever on the wheel, so I just bought new one and connected them back. I also bought new brake shoes, but the old shoes were actually in very good shape! so I just kept the new ones as spares ones.\nFor the front brake, well all the brake fluid leaked out, so no wonder it didn't work, plus the brake pads were worn out. So, I did not bother trying to rebuild the master cylinder (which was probably the faulty part) but just replaced with a new one, that looked a lot better, master cylinders are pretty cheap nowadays. I also replaced the old brake line that was cracked, with a brand new stainless steel braided brake line, I then installed the new brake pads, poured in new brake fluid, bleed the brake, and VOILA !\nBonus tip : How to bleed brake easily.\nBleeding brake is often seen as an annoying thing, that often requires 2 people. Actually most of the time, bleeding brakes only takes me about 20 min.\nWhat I do is I just pour brake fluid in the master cylinder's reservoir, then, before even trying to bleed the system, I just open the nipple on the caliper then with through a (at least 50cm long) transparent hose, I suck air out, either with a syringe... or my mouth lol, and you'll see the brake fluid level go down in the master cylinder's reservoir. Do this few times, then you can start bleeding the brakes normally, and you'll see that it'll be much faster!\nHow to bleed brakes? pretty easy: pump the lever with one hand, then press it, with the other end open (for 2 sec) the nipple on the caliper, then close it, and then release the lever. Repeat until no air bubbles comes out and brake lever is very stiff!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGB/Z4WN/JTIYMI3M/FGBZ4WNJTIYMI3M.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Make It Rideable Again"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "When I had the idea of restoring and re purposing this bike, I didn't plan on restoring it as original.\nToo many original parts were severely damaged or corroded for this, and those original are extremely expensive, the exhaust system for example, that broke in 2 pieces because of rust, cost $1500 alone!!\nPlus, I wanted this bike to be even more \"all purpose\", to be able to ride on the streets, but also be able to go on dirt roads in the countryside!\nSo I decided to make this bike a scrambler!!\nWhat is a scrambler? it is basically an old school trail bike, most of the time, they are street bike that are re purposed to ride on both street and dirt roads.\nWhat does your bike needs to be a scrambler? well, first of all, the tires, it needs dual purpose tires with knobs, so you can ride the bike in the dirt. Then it is also a good idea to upgrade the suspension, which I did, and also maximize ground clearance, especially by avoiding \"low exhaust\". Foam air filters are also a good idea, but for occasional ride in the dirt, well oiled and maintained \"K&N style\" filters can work too, just make sure to clean and oil them often (on every dirt ride).\nSo I wanted to re purpose this bike as a scrambler but also make it look really cool! so here is what I did to achieve a new clean look:\nI sanded down the frame and re-painted in black, I also painted the wheels hub in black to contrast with the new chrome rims and spoke. Installed enduro tires that are great for both road and dirt. I also painted the fork in black and installed fork boots in order to protect the from dust and give it a cleaner look.\nI had the gas tank painted in Red to contrast with the rest of the bike.\nI wanted to have a very shinny and clean engine, so I spent a lot of time cleaning the original parts, I actually did not repaint any of those!! I used mostly steel wool to clean and polish the chrome and aluminium parts of the engine. Steel wool is really great and better than sandpaper because it will not scratch the parts like sandpaper does, and it also make them shine :)\nAnd I also changed many parts like handlebars, grips, levers, etc. to match the rest of the bike and changed about every nut and bolt with new stainless steel ones.\nBut one thing I like a lot on this bike is my custom hand made seat that I built entirely myself!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYS/SPUN/JTMSYQOA/FYSSPUNJTMSYQOA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTB/HMIW/JTMSYQOC/FTBHMIWJTMSYQOC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7Q/OWO4/JTMSYQQ0/F7QOWO4JTMSYQQ0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSY/VBZD/JTMSYQP6/FSYVBZDJTMSYQP6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQA/8264/JTMSYQRF/FQA8264JTMSYQRF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Giving It a New Pretty Body & Style"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Now it is time to enjoy that salvaged bike and make it ride again on the street it probably rode on about 40 years ago!\nI always find it satisfying and impressive to think that a vehicle that is almost twice your age can still run after a restoration.\nI think we probably all have already seen or knew someone who had a junk motorcycle sitting and rotting in their backyards for decades, now you know that it can always be restored and you know what are the main steps you need to go through to make a bike run again!\nBut remember to always ride safe!! before the first ride (and also every other ride), make sure all the bolts are secure, brakes are working, tire pressure is good, etc.!

It means when they are stretched in one direction, they expand in the other direction.\" Cool huh? Well, we believe that the smartness in the behavior of this metamaterials is very potent in creating shape-change and adaption.\n\nInspiration:\nOf course, due to the science-based nature of this project, we are not the inventors of auxetics. Auxetics was first invented in 1978 by the Berlin researcher K. Pietsch. Since then, researchers continued working on this topic, one of my favorites is this one by MIT Media Lab so far:\nKinetix - MIT Media Lab\n\nContribution:\nHowever, our contribution to this scientific research is to continue exploring their behavior on a larger scale and possibly defining functionality while integrating fabrication techniques and material properties.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLL/SM28/JTMSF8WX/FLLSM28JTMSF8WX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Aim"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Tools:\nFirst of all, download the file ( it basically helps you to know the size of each wood piece and where there should be rigid/flexible joints) .

I attached a link for downloading here:\nRhinoceros 6 download\nDesign process:\nIn our study case, there is a higher level of dependency between design, structure, and material. Since the behavior of the chair and the right choice of material and geometry are interdependent, our design process starts digitally. We started by exploring different 2d patterns and their deformations, in order to achieve an auxetic behavior.\nAs you can see in the third image, we can break down our design into 3 main parts: rigid body, rigid joints, and elastic joints. The amount of elasticity of the flexible joints, size of the rigid body units and stiffness of the rigid joints were all parameters which needed to be taken into consideration in order to achieve the desired deformation.\n\nSimulation:\nWe also did a rough deformation analysis was also done with KIWI!3d ( grasshopper plugin) in order to have a better estimation of the expected deformation.\nResult:\nHowever, the result was a fairly good start point to understand the behavior in a more tangible way, but we soon realized that physical prototyping was a better approach to anticipate and test the ideas than digital simulation.

It was also a given that a huge amount of spatial change was achieved with a minimum force. Although the first prototype with one 2D unit was not the design goal for the chair, it has the most spatial change.\nThen we continued the prototyping process by connecting two units together in xy plane. The same amount of deformation freedom was achieved since the units were not constrained in 3D, so as a more pleasant design. This prototype also demonstrated the spatial potential of creating positive and negative spaces.

The materials we used can be listed as below:\nwood glue\nmetal hinges (27)\nscrews\nsilicon rubber\nshrinking tube + lighter ( for micro scale)\ndried timber wood (3mm*1mm* (n)mm)\nFor a rigid body of the structure, wood can perform well for the rigid body of the structure as well as the rigid joints where there is a lot of force concentration. For the elastic parts, silicon rubber is applicable since it gives freedom to move and also transfers forces between elements. Regarding materials we are using, our method would include two main steps first is to cut the wood pieces in the desired shapes for both rigid body and rigid joints(making whole rigid parts) then doing final assembly by connecting elastic parts.\nAssembly tools:\n\nOur tools for assembly which are shown in the photo are consist of wood glue, metal hinges, rubber, screws, and screwdriver. Gluing rigid joints is the first step of the assembly where rigid body woods are connecting to rigid joint cubes with a male/female joinery system. After all the rigid joineries were done pieces were put together regarding our design and places where flexible joints are happening were marked. Metal hinges are screwed to the edges of wood sticks. Hinges are keeping the rigid parts together while they have the flexibility of movement in one axis which results in the final movement of the whole system.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYZ/CYHH/JTMSFCC7/FYZCYHHJTMSFCC7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKY/473T/JTMSFCCZ/FKY473TJTMSFCCZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7W/FJZB/JTMSFCEZ/F7WFJZBJTMSFCEZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI5/PYPD/JTMSFCDQ/FI5PYPDJTMSFCDQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJQ/4CMU/JTMSFCDV/FJQ4CMUJTMSFCDV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0H/LIXI/JTMSFCDY/F0HLIXIJTMSFCDY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCS/TQ0F/JTMSFCET/FCSTQ0FJTMSFCET.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGR/UB2W/JTMSFCBV/FGRUB2WJTMSFCBV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Fabrication and Assembly"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBA/DUXY/JTMSFDCV/FBADUXYJTMSFDCV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOT/G277/JTMSFDDT/FOTG277JTMSFDDT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Final Product"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Maybe it is not the most comfortable chair now, but for us this project was more or less a proof of concept for a conceptual drift in designing shape changing furniture, and considering our limited time and student budget we decided to go for bigger units, which means bigger holes and less chance to be comfortable while sitting on it!\nHowever, considering the unit based nature of this design proposal, it is believed that a human interaction approach is a great match for this research.

I am humbled that you were compelled enough to click on my link to learn this simply made, yet beautiful rack (yes I am bias). It all started about a year ago when my wife needed a shoe rack, but all the ones that looked solid built cost an arm and a leg, so, I figured I would just build one. Midway through the project we both realized it looked like a total piece of trailer trash even with us being rednecks! So she gave up, which in turn, made me want to prove her wrong, because that\u2019s marriage, and this could be awesome! So with a little outside the box thinking, black screws opposed to gold, and the beautiful addition of scrap steel as the shelving, voila, my rustic steel combo was born. That lead to multiple experiments and variations, including this one, as it is the first I have built! So it has been fun, but I assure you I am NOT a YouTube worthy wood craftsman, nor do I claim what I do is correct, but it works, so if you will humor me and take a shot, I bet you can make it better than I can. Also I am doing all of this from my iPad so bear with my splleing and punctuaytiom.\n\nSince the challenge was organization, I wanted to modify my standard coat rack to be more...multipurpose.

I have a very small workshop so I thought making a mobile base would be a much better option.\nMaterials Used:\n2x CLS - 63mm x 38mm x 2400mm\n6mm Plywood\n18mm Plywood\nCastors\nPocket Hole Screws\nWood Screws\nWashers\nTools Used:\nMitre Saw\nTable Saw\nDrill & Driver\nPocket Hole Jig", "title": "Simple DIY Mobile Tool Base", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-DIY-Mobile-Tool-Base/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I start the project by cutting the CLS to length at the mitre saw. The cut list makes this process simple. I don't have to think too much. I just measure the length I need to cut, mark it and then cut. This cut list is obviously to fit the BS350S but you can adapt it to any size you like.\nTo join the CLS together I opted to use Pocket Hole joinery. This is done by drilling holes using a Pocket Hole Jig and then fastening the wood together with Pocket Hole Screws. Don't worry if you don't have a Pocket Hole Jig. You can simple join the wood with regular wood screws. Drill a pilot hole first and then fasten the pieces together with screws.\nThe grey dots represents where the Pocket Holes need to be drilled. I used 64mm Pocket Hole Screws to fasten the joints together. The colour coding should hopefully help show how the pieces go together. Its a simple procedure of screwing the parts together to make the frame.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQA/I6AH/JROTOXNU/FQAI6AHJROTOXNU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOK/WQIF/JROTOYYR/FOKWQIFJROTOYYR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZE/76PO/JROTOYFO/FZE76POJROTOYFO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7Z/AZDQ/JROTOYHG/F7ZAZDQJROTOYHG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYL/A4W8/JROTOYHL/FYLA4W8JROTOYHL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEE/20BX/JROTOYHM/FEE20BXJROTOYHM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUF/6BZV/JROTOY18/FUF6BZVJROTOY18.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRH/2Q18/JROTOYHN/FRH2Q18JROTOYHN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYP/RQWE/JROTOYHO/FYPRQWEJROTOYHO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX4/TVYA/JROTOYHP/FX4TVYAJROTOYHP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLI/82G4/JROTOYHS/FLI82G4JROTOYHS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6I/HFMN/JROTOYJE/F6IHFMNJROTOYJE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Make the Frame"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "With the framework put together its time to cut the plywood to size.

I secured the top and bottom pieces to the frame using regular wood screws. I drilled pilot holes first to prevent the wood from splitting.\nNext task was to cut the 6mm plywood to size. I needed one piece at 540mm x 399mm. I also needed 2 pieces at 362mm x 399mm. These pieces will clad the outside of the frame. These also get attached using regular wood screws.

The castors have quite a large hole where the screws go so a regular head to a wood screw would just go right through it. Adding a washer helps to prevent this too.\nNow to put the bandsaw on the base. If you're moving heavy equipment make sure you lift it safely and always get someone to help you if you can. I secured the bandsaw in place using 100mm screws. These aren't ideal but they will do the job for me. I added a washer to them to help spread the load more evenly and help prevent the head of the screw squeezing through the holes on the base of the bandsaw.\nThat's the base done. Nice and simple but it does the job. It moves a lot easier now than it did on the original base. I am a little worried about it possibly tipping if I push heavier pieces through my bandsaw. If it does, I can always add some kick out legs to prevent it from tipping.

I actually got lucky a few months ago and found myself with a craft room of my own, and so decided that it was time to create exactly the table I always wanted.\nEqually as important as the tabletop space is the storage underneath...particularly storage space for very awkward items.\nI have an A3 guillotine, an A3 paper creaser, 3 long greeting card boxes, and a disassembled tabletop loom, and let me tell you that those things are a real pain to store! They are mostly long and thin which is why they do not fit on your normal shelves or in your normal cupboards. In my previous home, they had to be kept on top of tables, and that was really not a good solution because then there was no table space spare.\nSo I set about designing a table that was easy to build, as cheap as I could feasibly make it, and had storage areas underneath to keep all my awkward crafty things organised.\nIn order to keep the cost, time taken and the weight of the table to a minimum, a few parts are bought from IKEA. The areas that need to be custom sizes have been made by me and my helpful boyfriend (i.e. the owner of the power tools :))\nWe have not built furniture before so this is a pretty basic and simple build - and it proved to be a good starter project for woodwork newbies.\nI really hope you like what I've created, thanks for reading!", "title": "DIY Huge Sewing Table for a Craft Room | Custom Storage Shelving Unit", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Huge-Sewing-Table-for-a-Craft-Room-Custom-Stor/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "- Wood: I used 25 mm and 18 mm MDF, plus a piece of 3 mm hardboard. I wanted an even and smooth white finish so that it would match the white IKEA Kallax unit as closely as possible - meaning that all of the units would match in the final assembled table.\nYou could use plywood instead if you wished, or even a wood with a nice grain on it that you want to leave exposed and on display. It's up to you!\nI had the pieces cut out for me at B&Q (a DIY store in the UK) which was a huge help, and was vital for me as I don't have any other way of cutting wood pieces that big. I believe you would need a track or table saw to cut the pieces yourself.\n(Please see the next step for information on the sizes & dimensions of wood I needed.)\nIf you need to trim any wood pieces, you will also need a band saw, circular saw, or even a hand saw...or for small adjustments you could use a well-sharpened plane. Luckily, all of the wood pieces we had cut for us were accurate and so we didn't need to do any cutting ourselves.\n- Router: To make 'through dadoes' (grooves/slots) in the wood surface. The dadoes I cut were 5mm deep and 12 mm wide, so I used a 12 mm straight router bit. Your router cutter size will depend on the width of the dadoes you want to cut.\nIf you're in the U.S. you could use a table saw instead of a router.\n- Tape measure & ruler\n- Clamps\n- Hammer\n- Paint, Paintbrush, Roller & Tray: I bought some matte white MDF primer (by Dulux) and some 'white' spray paint. However, the spray paint turned out to be more of a creamy yellow colour, and so since the MDF primer was already a really good match for the white Kallax unit that we already had, we just ended up painting the whole thing with only the primer. Maybe not what you are supposed to do, but it is exactly the finish I wanted!\n- Masking tape\n- Sanding block & sandpaper (240 grit or so)\n- Breathing mask, safety specs, face shield & good ventilation; MDF dust is not good to breathe in, so you'll need these items particularly when cutting, driilling, sanding and painting.\n- Wood glue\n- Wood screws, plus a few washers.\n- Drill & drill bits; I used an electric drill and a pillar drill, along with drill bits of 1.5 mm, 4 mm & 6 mm.\n- Wooden dowels; The ones I used were 6 mm but I wouldn't go larger than that.\n- Scrap wood: To make various jigs, and also to join the tabletops together. These pieces were mostly made using MDF we had left over from the initial sheets we bought, plus some small pieces of plywood and pine scraps we already had.\n- Tabletops:I bought 2 IKEA Gerton tabletops, which are solid beech wood and measure 1550 x 750 mm each. Either find tabletops to make up the size of table you want, or of course you could make your own instead.\n- Filler & scraper tool (optional); I used a tiny amount of white Polyfilla to smooth the joins and the MDF edges at the front of the units.\n- Pencil\n- Kallax flat-pack unit from IKEA (optional) & Inserts: We used the Kallax as part of the assembled unit, but of course you could make everything from scratch instead if you wanted. I also bought 6 ready-made inserts from IKEA; 4 cupboard door inserts and 2 drawer inserts.\n- Felt pads; for underneath the units to protect the floor.\n- Wallpaper, wallpaper paste, bowl, wallpaper brush, glue, utility knife & scissors (optional); This is what I used to cover the hardboard backing, however you could just glue the wallpaper (or other decorative paper) on instead. This is an optional step, as you may decide you don't want a backing at all, or you could paint the board instead of papering it. Also note that you can just glue the wallpaper on if you don't have paste.\nCost\nI estimate that it cost me around \u00a3350 to make this table, with \u00a372 being spent on the wood (although I had a fair bit left over too), \u00a3150 on the tabletops, \u00a3110 on the Kallax and inserts from IKEA, and a little more spent on paint and bits 'n' pieces. The tools and other things we already had, such as the router, glue and Polyfilla.\nAlthough not cheap, I'm sure that if there was a product like this for sale it would be a lot more expensive, especially if it was custom built!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FW5/F6EP/JTEMYJ9T/FW5F6EPJTEMYJ9T.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: What You Will Need"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "You will first need to design your units to make sure it will fit in everything you want. In my case, I had to measure all of my most awkwardly shaped craft items and figure out how and where to fit them all in.\nI also needed to work out how high I wanted the table to be, considering I will mostly be standing up to use it, and also how big overall I want it to be. Once these dimensions are known, the sizes of the wood pieces you need can be calculated.\nDiagram 1: This shows a wide but quite shallow unit which will house my paper creaser at the top, my guillotine in the centre, and then at the bottom I wanted to be able to have 2 IKEA Kallax inserts. These inserts will be ready-made cupboard doors, as they are just easier and cheaper to buy than make to be honest! For these to fit, the opening needs to be 335 x 335 mm exactly. The narrow gap in between is just what is left over, but would be big enough for A4 paper/card.\nNote: In this unit only, I will be adding a hardboard backing. I have therefore made the top 2 shelves and the shelf dividers 5 mm shallower than the other sections. The effect will be that these pieces will be recessed at the back to create space for the hardboard back.\nDiagram 2: This shows a narrow but deep unit which will house my 3 long card boxes. As with the other unit I'm making, the sides are made from 25 mm MDF, the shelves are made from 12 mm MDF, and 5 mm deep dadoes (grooves) cut into the sides will hold the shelves.\nDiagram 3: This shows the pre-bought IKEA Kallax grid storage in grey, and then on top are the 2 blocks of 25 mm MDF that I'm going to need to add. This is mostly to make the 770 mm height of the Kallax up to the 850 mm height I want, but also to create more storage space in between these blocks that is long enough to house my loom pieces :)\nDiagram 4: This shows the cutting guide that I took to B&Q to get my wood pieces cut. On the left is the 25 mm MDF and on the right is the 12 mm MDF.

Therefore, you will need to use thicker wood for the shelves, in order to accommodate the dadoes. This Instructable (not made by me) is particularly good if you want to see how a grid design would be made.\nI made my dadoes 5 mm deep, 12 mm wide (i.e. the thickness of my shelves), and they were cut all of the way across the width of my 'uprights'.\nIn total, I had to put 2 dadoes into 4 pieces of wood. As we hadn't made furniture before, we practised on some scrap wood first to work out where we needed to position the router to get the dado in the correct place.\nWe used our 'practice' piece of scrap wood to guide the router, as it has a straight edge. You can buy a straight edge or a clamp guide to do this bit instead of using a long piece of wood, but whatever you use, just make sure that it is long enough to span the width of the wood piece you're cutting into.\nWe used our practice run calculations (see the whiteboard photo, where the circle is the router and the top rectangle is the scrap wood guide) to place the scrap board into position on the wood piece we wanted to cut, and clamped it in place. In our case, the dado would be positioned 72 mm from wherever we placed the straight edge.\nWe then used the straight edge of the scrap wood to guide the router all of the way across the wood pieces to cut the dadoes.\nFrom the photos you will see that for the the 2 narrowest uprights, we placed them next to each other with the sides lined up perfectly, then cut the dadoes across both pieces at once in order to make the position of the dadoes identical on both pieces. Just make sure the router moves smoothly across this join.\nWe didn't have the space to cut the 2 largest uprights side-by-side, so we instead made a jig (322 mm long) that helped us ensure the scrap wood was the correct distance from the edge when we cut the dadoes into the individual uprights.\nWhat you are aiming for is for the sides of the units to be identical on the inside, so that the shelves won't be wonky and will go in smoothly. Repeat until you have cut all the dadoes.\nNote: Don't cut too fast otherwise the cuts may not be smooth.\nYour shelves should now fit snugly in these dadoes.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1I/JOXA/JTCSP0VY/F1IJOXAJTCSP0VY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUM/VM5P/JTCSP0WF/FUMVM5PJTCSP0WF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVQ/CGU7/JTCSP0WM/FVQCGU7JTCSP0WM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4B/H8LL/JTCSP0WW/F4BH8LLJTCSP0WW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYP/NPSA/JTCSP12H/FYPNPSAJTCSP12H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ4/N1T0/JTCSP12J/FJ4N1T0JTCSP12J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWH/1D4D/JTCSP12L/FWH1D4DJTCSP12L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYL/GGA0/JTCSP12Q/FYLGGA0JTCSP12Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9M/UO9W/JTCSP12U/F9MUO9WJTCSP12U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDK/58ID/JTCSPAR6/FDK58IDJTCSPAR6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTI/398L/JTCSPB17/FTI398LJTCSPB17.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Routing"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "We're going to insert wooden dowels into the base of each unit (one in each corner), that will go up into the upright sides of the units.

This will mean that at the back of this particular unit, the shelves will be recessed (to make room for the backing).\nOne extra step we then did was to add a tiny amount of slightly-watered-down white Polyfilla to the joins at the front of the units - where the shelves meet the uprights - and along the front edges of the shelves and the base.

The reason I didn't use a laser cutter for this stage (like with other projects I've done in the past) is that katalox is too dense to cut on a laser cutter without burning it up.\nWith all the pieces cut out, I took some wood files and filed down the edges of all the cutouts.

As a beginner in the sport, you can go to any retail store that sells archery equipment and buy a dozen low-grade carbon arrow shafts that are pre-fletched. Those arrows will get the job done in terms of developing your form and technique, but they are limited in accuracy because of the straightness of the shaft and fletching. A dozen high-end carbon arrows can range from 100 to 200 dollars depending on the brand and greatly improve your accuracy. With use over time, vanes will begin to peel off, get sliced by broadheads, and become deformed. These accidents have a huge impact on arrow flight and should be fixed immediately. Replacing a perfectly good arrow because of damaged fletching isn\u2019t cost effective.

I use this thing to sand off elephant's foot on 3D-printed parts often.\nAggressive finesse by use of force rather than speed (again, no end grain burning!)\nEnables sanding to be part of the sculpting/shaping process for items like spoons.\n\nOk, now Why the Who:\nThe KitchenAid Mixer is the perfect candidate to drive a slow-speed, high-torque sander. Not only is it the perfect candidate, it's begging to be a shop tool.\nIt's heavy\nIt's crazy powerful with lots of torque\nIt has a variable speed adjuster setting\nIt has a PTO attachment port. (in other words, it's a tractor)\n--\nHistory: Previous Slow Speed Sanders I've Built/Tried/Used\nHere are my previous slow-speed sander builds over the past few years that led up to the Kitchen Aid.\nDrill - handheld: hard to control.\nDrill - clamped in vise: Awkward to clamp, hard to control speed.\nVariable speed right-angle grinder: Actually a decent setup, A bit too fast\nLathe attachment: Still a bit fast (on my lathe) but otherwise very nice.\n30RPM motor: Too slow.\nKitchenAid: For spoon sculpting, the KitchenAid is, IMO, far better than any of my previous setups.\n--\nResources\n7-minute YouTube walkthrough of the design, reason, and build:\nThingiverse for 3D Printed Parts: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3507813\nMy website for additional content outside the scope of this Instructable.\n\nLet's get on with it!\n\nWarning about Sanding Dust:\nUnlike fairy dust, sanding dust is REAL.

A pendent or coin is a good choice.\nNext, you'll need the silicone to cast your metal. While it's possible to use sand or plaster, I find they both have their problems. Plaster contains water and will crack when the water evaporates and sand gives you a very rough surface, and doesn't capture small details. I'll be covering green-sand casting with zinc and copper in a future instructable.\nI'm using mold max 60. It's not cheap, but it gives the best possible result. You can buy it from amazon. https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mold-Resistant-Silicone-R... (uk link)\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Mold-High-Resistant-Silicon...\nNow you need the metal. I get my pewter from old tankards I buy from charity shops. The old battered ones are best because they are the cheapest. You'll be cutting it up and melting down the metal, so the quality doesn't matter. Don't worry if the metal looks dull, it'll look like new once melted down. You can also buy pewter ingots online.\nYou'll also need something to melt the pewter. I'm using a furnace, but that isn't necessary.

First estimate the volume needed. You'll want to mix a little more silicone than needed because there'll probably be losses. Find the ratio of silicone to activator. With mold max 60 it's 100 parts A to 3 parts B by weight. You'll need a gram scale for accurate measurements. I got mine for \u00a313 on amazon.\nPour the amount of silicone you need into a pot. I highly advise wearing gloves when doing this. The silicone gets everywhere and is very difficult to get off your hands. Rubbing alcohol is great for removing it from your countertops. Don't pour the silicone into your nice measuring jug though. Instead, measure it with water, then pour the water into a disposable pot and mark how high the water is. Empty the water and fill the silicone to the line you've just drawn.\nNow weigh the silicone, remembering to take the weight of the pot away from the final measurement. Now you need to add part B; the activator. The silicone will only set once this is added. Assuming the ratio required is 100:3, take the weight of your silicone and divide it by 33.3.\nLet's say you used 150 grams of silicone. You need to add 4.5 grams of activator. Place a second pot on your scales and zero them. Now slowly add the activator (with a pipette if you have one) until the scales read 4.5 grams. Then add the contents to your first pot and still well.\nMake sure the mixture is fully mixed, otherwise the silicone won't set properly. Once that is done, it's time to pour.\nNow, you're meant to use a vacuum pump to get rid of all the bubbles from your silicone before pouring. I Didn't have one. If you happen to have a degasser, use it. Otherwise do what I did.\nPour the silicone slowly from about waist height, with the container with your object on the floor. (Please cover the floor with newspaper first) This will stretch the silicone as it falls, and get rid of any bubbles. Try to pour in one place at the lowest point of your container.\nWhen you're done, leave the silicone to set. Wait at least 20 minutes before touching it. Then put it somewhere safe, and wait 24 hours for it to set properly.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FU1/SWA1/JT91M2HH/FU1SWA1JT91M2HH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Making the Molds."}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "When the molds are set, remove them from your container and carefully remove your object.

They can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6q0fd3ileW...\nYou can just pour the pewter directly into the mold. This works for some objects like the ring I used for this tutorial, but some objects with flat backs get a much better result if you cut a channel in the top of the mold, clamp a sheet of metal to both sides, and pour into the channel.

I'm using English pewter which is supposed to have no lead content, but a respirator should be worn when dealing with any metal fumes.\nI've added a video of the casting process. It's pretty simple, but takes a bit of practice.\nGet the furnace/ blowtorch, stove, whatever else you want to use, heated up, then add the pewter into a heat resistant container. Don't let it get too hot though, or you'll burn the pewter. You're aiming for no higher than 240C.\nWhen the metal has melted, scape off the stuff floating at the top with a metal spoon. This are impurities, called dross or slag. When you see a shiny liquid metal, it's time to pour.\nAct fast, but don't rush. Too slow and the metal will set before you've filled the mold, too fast, and you'll spill the metal everywhere.\nOnce it's cooled down (this happens in minutes with pewter) use pliers to remove the pewter from the mold. Place it in water to make sure it's cool enough to touch.\nDon't expect a good result the first time. There's often a little bit of moisture in the mold which causes air bubbles.

It should only take a few minutes to darken.\nAnother way I accidentally discovered by myself. I was attempting to copper plate some pewter pendants I made. I used a copper acetate bath and ran about 6 volts of electricity through it with the pewter on the negative terminal and a piece of copper on the positive. The actual plating didn't turn out too well. I got a bit of copper on the edges, but that's it. However, it darkened the metal significantly, giving it a weathered look.

We both enjoy a good bottle (or two...) now and then and over the years she's acquired a small collection of wine bottle stoppers as gifts or souvenirs from her travels. While she loved the one that I had made for her, it relegated some of her other stoppers to a kitchen drawer for storage, and before I knew it I was digging through a pile of bottle stoppers every time I needed a pen or pair of scissors. Something had to be done.\nI follow several fantastic woodworkers on youtube, and one of these is Frank Howarth. He is a tremendous designer and is known for his ability to take real-life objects and create a wooden version of them, often using his lathe and CNC (he's made a wooden 8-ball, a football, the Death Star, etc). While kicking around design ideas for bottle stopper storage in my head for a few days, I was watching some of his videos and got inspired to see if I could create a wine bottle out of wood and find a way to mount bottle stoppers on it. Follow me through this Instructable and see how this was done.", "title": "Wooden Wine Bottle Stopper Display", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Wooden-Wine-Bottle-Stopper-Display/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "My intention was to try and remake a bottle of Josh, my girlfriend's favorite wine brand, and was hoping to do so with some scrap woods hanging around the shop. To match colors, I decided to go with walnut for the darkness of the bottle, maple for the lightness of the label, and purpleheart for the boldness of the foil on the top. Since I didn't have thick enough boards, I needed to laminate pieces of all three woods together to get enough thickness.\nI ran them all across the jointer to flatten the sides that I would be glueing together, and then trimmed them down to size on the miter and table saws. With the blanks ready to go, I glued all of the individual wood species together to build them up to thickness. Once dry, I took them to the disc sander to flatten up all of the ends that would then be glued together.\nOne great component of wood turning is that - unlike traditional woodworking and furniture making - since much of the outside of the wood blanks will be turned away in a shower of wood shavings, having to run through the typical jointer/planer/table saw process to mill all of the sides perfectly parallel with 90\u00b0 corners isn't a concern. Since the walnut blank will need to be cut in approximately half (to represent the bottle above and below the label), I squared one corner and cut it down to size.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPX/UELX/JT91OFKP/FPXUELXJT91OFKP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSU/JQTY/JT91ONTG/FSUJQTYJT91ONTG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4P/7FB1/JT91ONTL/F4P7FB1JT91ONTL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHK/B9HH/JT91ONU1/FHKB9HHJT91ONU1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP3/M8KT/JT91ONUI/FP3M8KTJT91ONUI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPU/S804/JT91ONVO/FPUS804JT91ONVO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM9/VY2F/JT91ONY8/FM9VY2FJT91ONY8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPW/WW74/JT91OO2C/FPWWW74JT91OO2C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU0/JQ43/JT91OO2K/FU0JQ43JT91OO2K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2B/MDX7/JT91OO2O/F2BMDX7JT91OO2O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG5/GCBA/JT91OO2W/FG5GCBAJT91OO2W.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Selecting and Milling Lumber"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "With all of the pieces cut down to an approximate size, I need to figure out how to attach all of them together. Since the edges that will be joined together are end grain, a simple glue joint wont be strong enough to inspire much of my confidence when I'll be turning it at thousands of RPMs on the lathe. Now, I'm lucky enough to have a Festool Domino and I use it at nearly every opportunity (to rationalize how much money I spent on the damn thing!), but in this case the process for aligning the mortise locations on pieces that are not the same size simply isn't worth it.\nSo I decided to go with dowels to inject some additional strength into the piece. The easiest way to do this is to create a simple one-use doweling jig to ensure that all of the dowel holes are perfectly spaced on all of the pieces. I cut a piece of plywood to a similar size to the blanks and ensured that one corner was at a perfect 90\u00b0 angle. I put 'X' marks on each edge of this corner on both the top and bottom of the jig, and labeled the two faces 'T' and 'B' for top and bottom. The idea here is that when I'm drilling into the end grain of the blanks, if the face that I'm drilling into is on the top of that particular blank, I orient it so that the 'T' is facing up (or the 'B' is facing up if it's the bottom side of the blank). This ensures that the holes on two joining faces will be perfectly aligned.\nI drilled three holes an inch apart in a triangle pattern that were just ever so slightly undersized relative to the diameter of the dowel plugs that I'm using. The exact placement of these holes is inconsequential, as long as they will not be so far apart that I might end up turning the bottle down too far on the lathe and exposing the dowels within. After figuring out how I wanted the blanks aligned to give me the best grain pattern, I marked the edges with 'X' marks to line up with the dowel jig that I just made. Using the same drill bit, I figured out the depth that I needed to drill (the thickness of the jig plus slightly more than half of the dowel length) and marked that with blue tape on the drill bit. I then drilled the dowel mortises on each face of the blanks, being sure to have the jig properly aligned each time.\nI test-fitted all of the dowel plugs without pushing the blanks all of the way together, as my slightly undersized dowel holes will produce a serious pressure fit that will be hard to take off. Now for the glue up. When doing end grain gluing, I prefer to use long-set epoxy. This penetrates the end grain better and gives a longer working time than traditional wood glue. Here's my process for end grain glue ups: 1) Wet the end grain with water to open the pores of the grain. 2) Spread on a healthy layer of epoxy and allow it to soak into the end grain - this needs to be done several times until the epoxy is no longer being absorbed. You can see in the pictures above how much of this will get absorbed into the pores. 3) When reapplications of the epoxy stop soaking into the end grain, it's ready to be joined together.\nI inserted the dowels into their mortises with epoxy on them, and hammered them together.

First, while all of the corners are intact, I want to mark the center points on each end. I'll start with the bottom end of the bottle blank, drawing lines between opposing corners - the intersection of these lines is the center point. I did the same process for the top piece of purpleheart, but since this piece may be ever-so-slightly offset from the center of the body of the blank, it's important to ensure that the center point on top is in the exact same plane as the one on the bottom. From the centerpoint on the bottom of the blank, I traced two lines on opposing faces all of the way up the sides of the piece until they intersected again at the very top. This point indicates the exact centerpoint of the top of the blank relative to the bottom.\nSince this blank isn't one uniform dimension (as I didn't have enough purpleheart to match the size of the walnut and maple), I want to trim off some of the excess waste wood on the bandsaw to make it a little more balanced on the lathe. This process also allows me to knock back the square corners of the blank, which will save me time and tear-out when I'm roughing the blank into round. To accomplish this, I removed the fence and angled the table of the bandsaw to 45\u00b0, cutting these out by hand.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FE8/FKQL/JT91OOIN/FE8FKQLJT91OOIN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHQ/Q2TR/JT91OOIU/FHQQ2TRJT91OOIU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZG/WGQN/JT91OOKE/FZGWGQNJT91OOKE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ9/UZK9/JT91OOLX/FQ9UZK9JT91OOLX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Lathe Prep"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "As this blank is really just a large (mostly) cylindrical object, I chose to turn this project between centers. The base of the blank is now a strange octagonal shape, so mounting it in the chuck would not be stable, and using a woodworm screw on the base would require me to drill a hole in the bottom which wasn't preferable. So I seated my spur chuck on the bottom end of the blank by hammering it into the centerpoint with a deadblow mallet. After lining up the centerpoint on the top of the blank with the live center, I'm ready to turn.\nAdmittedly, I could have saved myself a little headache by first taking the blank to the drum sander and removing a little more of the outer material to get this blank slightly more round. But I honestly was too interested to see how this was going to turn out that I just mounted it on the lathe and went for it. I'm using carbide insert cutting tools to turn this, as they're incredibly easy to use and require very little of the technique that gouges do, so for instructional purposes I felt it was a good choice. Whenever starting a large new turning with carbide insert tools, I try to ensure that I rotate the inserts to give me a fresh new cutting edge to get the best results possible.\nTurning this blank was slow going at first, as I invested a lot of time in gingerly bringing the blank into round at a slow speed. Since the blank wasn't symmetrical along its width, the balance of the spinning lathe isn't ideal. A great tip for turning an unbalanced piece into round is to start your lathe on a slower speed (around 300-400 RPMs), gradually ramping up the speed until the lathe begins to vibrate and shake slightly, and then dial the speed back just a bit. It takes the guesswork out of deciding on a speed for roughing the blank, and once the piece gets closer to round, you can ramp the speed up a little more.\nI elected to rough this out as if the blank were two separate pieces: the body and the neck. When using carbide inserts to rough a blank into round, it helps to work on small 1\" sections at a time rather than trying to sweep across the length of the piece right at the start. When trying to determine how close to round a blank is, lightly resting the arm of the cutting tool on the top of the blank while it's spinning will indicate where you're at. A round blank will allow the tool to ride along the top smoothly, while one that still has a ways to go will produce a lot of chatter.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0G/TDJB/JT91OOND/F0GTDJBJT91OOND.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9Y/DES9/JT91OOOU/F9YDES9JT91OOOU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVT/TW1Y/JT91OORM/FVTTW1YJT91OORM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Turn Into Round"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Once the blank is fully round, it's time to define the shape. The three most important details to transfer from the actual wine bottle to the blank are the taper of the bottle, the curve of the neck transition, and the length and nub of the very top. Having the glass wine bottle on hand to use as a comparison while turning helps tremendously.\nWhile the taper of the bottom end of the bottle is fairly subtle and easy enough to quickly translate on the blank, the neck transition is a bit trickier. The curve at the top of the body begins earlier than you might think, and the neck shape swoops up before the walnut meets the purpleheart. I switched back and forth between my square radius carbide cutter and round nosed tool, as the former is best for quickly removing material and the latter is ideal for smoothing inside and outside curves. I checked my progress regularly by comparing the glass bottle, and stepped back from the lathe a few times to see how the shape looked from a glance.\nOnce I was happy with the neck profile, I needed to determine where the top end of the bottle will be, and used a parting tool and the round nosed carbide cutter to shape this profile. With the shape of the bottle complete, I pulled out my 100 grit cutting tool (aka sandpaper) and began to sand the entire piece thoroughly. Since I will be doing a good amount of work to the bottle before this project is finished, I only sanded through 100/150/180 grits and will finish the sanding later by hand.\nWith the blank removed from the lathe, the last two main shaping details to consider are removing the small tenon from the bottom of the bottle and cutting off the excess waste wood from the very top. I took the bottle to the bandsaw and carefully cut away the unwanted top of the neck where I marked with my parting tool. The drum sander was perfect for quickly hogging off the small tenon on the bottom of the bottle where I had it mounted on the lathe.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F19/EI1R/JT91ON10/F19EI1RJT91ON10.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3W/NHBT/JT91OOUJ/F3WNHBTJT91OOUJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW3/4A51/JT91OOWT/FW34A51JT91OOWT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX5/W667/JT91OOYO/FX5W667JT91OOYO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYN/B1XV/JT91OP1J/FYNB1XVJT91OP1J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR6/8KF2/JT91OP33/FR68KF2JT91OP33.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Final Turning and Sanding"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "So that actually looks pretty cool! It's definitely a wooden wine bottle at this stage, and I shuddered to think about the next step in this build, which is to drill a dozen holes across the face of the bottle. It was a little tempting just to put finish on the damn thing and place it in the kitchen as an art project, but since necessity is the mother of invention I reconciled myself to press on and drill out the holes to mount the bottle stoppers in...\nThis is one of those points in a project where you tend to step back and say, \"umm, how the hell am I going to do this?\" I need to 1) drill a dozen holes into a cylindrical object, and 2) those holes have to be drilled at an arbitrarily offset angle relative to the face of the object, and 3) they have to securely hold small delicate objects whose body is a cone shape. I really set myself up for success on this one...\nBreaking down those processes individually allowed me to see the best way to proceed. For the first consideration, I need to determine hole placement. For aesthetic purposes, I decided to have four bottle stoppers along each side of the bottle, three stoppers in the middle, and one sitting in the top (as bottle stoppers are prone to doing). Using a combination square, I marked out where the three columns of holes will be and struck lines along the length of the piece. Then I determined the individual placement of these holes - they'll be about 2.5\" apart vertically, and the middle column will be offset so that the holes fall in between the hole placement of the outside columns.\nWith the hole positions in place, it's on to problem number two. I experimented with the idea of using the drill press to drill these angled holes, which would require building a jig to hold the bottle at the correct angle. But after thinking it through, the extreme angle of these holes (about 30\u00b0 relative to the bottle) meant that the chuck of the drill press would get in the way when drilling holes further down the body, so that idea is out. Then I considered building a jig that I could mount to the workbench that would hold the bottle down horizontally and would have a pre-drilled guide hole at the correct angle. But securely holding down a cylindrical object required more engineering than I was interested in doing that particular afternoon, and I was worried that precise repeatably over twelve holes would be a concern. So, I scrapped all of these ideas and decided to drill out the holes by hand. The angles of these don't need to be spot on exact from hole to hole (31\u00b0 in one hole and 28\u00b0 in the next wouldn't be a huge deal), and I wont have to worry about a jig failing halfway through the project and being stuck with another dilemma. All I would need to do is mount the blank in the leg vise of the workbench, and drill away.\nLastly, how do I drill holes to securely hold a cone shaped object? For the hole in the top of the bottle, this is no issue - as long as the diameter of the hole is narrower than the top of the cone of the bottle stopper, the stopper will sit perfectly. But at a 30\u00b0 angle, a simple hole would allow the bottom tip of the stopper to rotate inward and the stopper would end up sitting at 45\u00b0 or more, which would not only look weird but would not hold them securely. After some experimentation on a scrap piece of wood, I decided that each mounting hole would actually contain two holes: one would be large enough that the majority of the bottle stopper base would slide into it, and the other would be small enough that it would hold the bottom tip of the stopper securely in place at the correct angle. I got the best results when using a 3/8\" forstner bit for the primary hole, and finishing off the hole with a 1/4\" forstner for the tip holder.\nWith all of the hurdles now overcome, it was time to drill. I found the best way to drill these was to start drilling perpendicularly to the bottle, slowly pivoting the bit as it gained a grip inside the hole, and leveling out when I hit around that 30\u00b0 that I was shooting for. This results in a tapered-looking hole, and the process was fairly straightforward and thankfully I didn't hit any snags.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FA7/IT2T/JT91OP4J/FA7IT2TJT91OP4J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQN/FH7O/JT91OPCW/FQNFH7OJT91OPCW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCN/D38H/JT91OPEC/FCND38HJT91OPEC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3L/NTSS/JT91OP61/F3LNTSSJT91OP61.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRQ/FFMK/JT91OPA0/FRQFFMKJT91OPA0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F37/UZO4/JT91OPFS/F37UZO4JT91OPFS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9C/7HQ3/JT91OPIK/F9C7HQ3JT91OPIK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN6/SDV9/JT91OPK1/FN6SDV9JT91OPK1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKV/XP5H/JT91OPLN/FKVXP5HJT91OPLN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Drilling Stopper Holes"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "The holes that I just drilled needed some cleanup and TLC to look pretty, so I went at them with a file and some low grit sandpaper. It was important not to change the actual shape of these holes during the cleanup process - rounding over edges or removing material on the inside of the holes will throw off the geometry and the stoppers wont sit properly. These holes don't have to be perfect, but for the ones that will be temporarily empty (until my girlfriend's bottle stopper collection catches up with this project), I want them to at least appear nice at a glance.\nMy plan for this bottle stopper display is to mount it on the wall, so I need to flatten the back face of the piece to allow for that. I decided how much of the back I wanted to remove and used the fence on the bandsaw to line up the blade at the correct spot. After cutting away this wastewood, I hand planed this newly cut face to make it perfectly smooth and flat.\nThere are a number mounting options I considered, but in the end I opted to go with keyhole hangers. These can be easily recessed into the back of the piece, and wont leave much chance for me to mess up the progress I've made so far. The first step here is to strike a line perfectly parallel to the body of the piece and centered on the back face that I flattened. Then, after tracing the outside keyhole hardware, I used a trim router with a plunge base to recess these holes by hand. After determining that the hardware sat flush in these recesses, I needed to remove enough material for a screw head to sit in.\nLastly, for the finish. I sanded the entire outside of the piece both with a random orbit sander and by hand, through grits 180/220/320. I want the finished piece to look glossy and almost like glass, so I opted to go with the glossy version of General Finishes Arm-R-Seal.

I processed all of these blanks at the same time, and it took me maybe 90 minutes from grabbing some blanks off the shelf to putting finish on the turned pieces.\nThe first step is to select your blanks and cut them to size. The ideal dimensions for a small project like this is about 2\" x 2\" x 4\". It's important for the blanks to be square to make it easier and quicker to turn them into round, and you need at least 3-4\" of length to be able to safely mount it on the lathe and have enough material to work with.\nOnce rouged out to dimension, it's time to drill holes to accommodate the stopper hardware. These are available at any of the woodworking specialty stores online for a few dollars, but I picked up a bag of 10 of them a little while ago and can grab one whenever I need an instant gratification project. Since these will be turned between centers, we need to find the center point on each end of the blanks. This is easily accomplished by drawing lines between opposing corners of the end of the blanks - the intersection of these lines is the center point. After finding the correct drill bit that matches the diameter of the mounting hardware, I can square up the blanks in a vise on the drill press and drill a hole on one end that is deep enough to accommodate the tenon or bolt on the end of the stopper hardware.\nTo mount on the lathe, put the hole that was just drilled into the end of the live center, and line up the point on the spur center at the center point of the other end of the blank, tightening down the tail stock. Since these blanks are fairly small and well balanced, cranking up the speed can make turning these a breeze.\nI used carbide insert turning tools on these blanks, and once the corners have been turned down and the piece is round, it's really just the creative process of finding the shape within the blank. First, use calipers to find the diameter of the outer piece of the stopper hardware that will meet up with the wooden handle. The end of the blank that is in the tailstock will be the part of this handle that meets the hardware, so it needs to be turned down to this same diameter. While roughing out a shape to the handle, turn down the waste wood above the top of the handle to a small tenon - this will make it easier to remove the waste wood after the handle is turned.\nWhen you're happy with the shape of the piece, it's time to thoroughly sand. I typically start at around 150 grit and sand up to at least 320. Then the blank can be removed from the lathe, and using a bandsaw or handsaw, the tenon can be cut away to remove the waste wood. Any remaining material on the top of the piece can be easily sanded away, and the top can be sanded smooth up to the same grit as the rest of the handle. Before finishing, wipe the pieces down with mineral spirits to clean up any remaining sanding dust.\nFor finish, it's easy to apply a few coats of lacquer and call it a day. For small pieces like this, use a long necked screwdriver to hold the piece upright while spraying on the lacquer. Some small spring clamps can be used to hold these screwdrivers upright on a work surface while they dry.\nOne the finishing process is complete, use epoxy or CA glue to attach the handles to the stopper hardware. Some hardware kits have a threaded mounting bolt which removes the need for any adhesives. That's it! This is a super quick and fun process and produces a finished piece in no time that can serve as a great handmade gift.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUQ/F0W1/JTENB2QJ/FUQF0W1JTENB2QJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9W/M7FP/JT91OTHC/F9WM7FPJT91OTHC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMS/YPZ5/JT91OTHD/FMSYPZ5JT91OTHD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLR/WH5J/JT91OQLR/FLRWH5JJT91OQLR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA7/B72C/JT91OTHE/FA7B72CJT91OTHE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHE/C4J9/JT91OQSS/FHEC4J9JT91OQSS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBU/DBRB/JT91OQUO/FBUDBRBJT91OQUO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL4/9BEA/JT91OQWY/FL49BEAJT91OQWY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA8/JRQR/JT91OTHF/FA8JRQRJT91OTHF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVI/TWLI/JT91OR1D/FVITWLIJT91OR1D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0F/XYMS/JT91OR45/F0FXYMSJT91OR45.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ1/CYTJ/JT91OR5K/FQ1CYTJJT91OR5K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR0/SEVI/JT91ORAC/FR0SEVIJT91ORAC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEU/JKGP/JT91ORAH/FEUJKGPJT91ORAH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: BONUS: How to Turn a Wine Bottle Stopper"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "In the end, what I can definitively say is that this ended up being a challenging build and a rewarding exercise in design, and produced a very unique piece which serves its intended function.

Conveniently, the 3/4\" plywood was a square. This allowed me to reference the 90 degree angle on 2 sides.\nThen, I used a marker, a ruler, and a combination square to connect the lines.\nAs a side note, I made a few brackets from scrap 1/2\" particle board because I ran out of 3/4\" plywood; however, I didn't use them - yet.

As an engineer I'm always looking at ways to improve things, and my first machine was no exception. The process began with some small changes which quickly turned into the opportunity to overhaul the design even more to better suit my needs (an overview of these changes is detailed in the next step).\nFor the previous iteration and documentation of my design, refer to my original Instructable: Modular DIY CNC Machine which has all the files included for easy access. For this Instructable, however, I've decided to include technical drawings of the plates rather than actual part files. The parts themselves are fairly easy to create so this shouldn't be a large inconvenience for most, especially if you plan on actually using a CNC since CAD is a big step in the whole CNC proces. In the future I'll provide the actual part files for a fee and may consider offering actual printed parts for purchase also for those without a 3D printer.\nWhether you've already made a CNC or this is your first one, I hope you find this Instructable helpful. Feel free to leave any comments or questions down below and if you like what you see please vote for me in the Build a Tool Contest!", "title": "Modular DIY CNC V2", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Modular-DIY-CNC-V2/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "After building my first CNC I realized there were a few things I incorporated that I didn't fully need in the design. Namely:\n1. The size. I originally wanted a CNC that was a decent size and could handle larger jobs, however I found myself only using the front half or so of the machine. This machine has a smaller cut area and I also changed the width and length proportions so wider pieces could be fit on the spoilboard. I did, however, leave the front and back of the machine open to allow for longer pieces to still fit by utilizing a pass through or indexing-like system (similar to one of the Glowforge models).\n2. Rigidity. The original machine had some play in the Z-axis when I mounted a router or spindle and when certain cuts were performed. For this design I chose to incorporate eccentric spacers on all the axis to take away this play and give a tighter grip to the framing.\n3. Materials. The previous machine was made out of 80/20 t-slot framing mainly because 80/20.net would cut the pieces to length and I wouldn't need to use any specialty tools (I essentially had no tools at the time). Through various other projects I've been able to grow my tool collection, and chose to order v-slot extrusions from Openbuilds and cut it to length myself. Additionally, I have a larger 3D printer now so I was able to print all the plates myself and didn't have to get them laser cut elsewhere. Initially I planned to use the 3D plates as prototypes before I ordered laser cut pieces or aluminum plates, however they seem to be holding up so the other options aren't needed.\n4. Electronics. One of my least favorite parts of the previous machine was the electronics bundling. This made it hard to move the machine around, and overall looked fairly messy. For this machine I chose to have a separate box with all the electrical components inside and adapters that can easily be detached if I need to move the machine. The box also has other features included in it that make it easier to use the machine and safer to operate. I also chose to omit limit switches for this design since I didn't use them much, but these can be added back in easily if needed later on.\n--------------------------------------------------\nThe area of travel for the cutting tool (500W spindle) is about 13\" in the X, 9.5\" in the Y and 5\" in the Z, but this could be increased if longer aluminum extrusions were used. The gantry moves along the Y-axis via belt drive with motors on either side of the frame while the X-axis moves perpendicular to the Y-axis along the gantry, also via belt drive. Attached to the X-axis is the Z-axis, which moves up and down via screw drive. I've also incorporated mounting holes on the plates to allow the axes to be converted to screw drive, however this still needs work to mount the motors and make sure everything else lines up.\nThe Z-axis still has a basic attachment scheme, meaning multiple tools can be attached so long as an adapter is designed with matching mounting holes. For my purpose, my 500W air powered spindle can attach and I've created an attachment for my 2.5W laser. You could also design an adapter for a pen or even a 3D printer head to name a few options.\nThe overall cost of this machine ends up being around $325, not including the spindle or laser. I hope you find this Instructable useful if you decide to build your own CNC. There are a lot of resources out there for doing so, and I hope I've created something that helps centralize a small portion of this information.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGS/22VP/JTCSLD22/FGS22VPJTCSLD22.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: The Design"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Frame:\nThe v-slot aluminum extrusions all come from Openbuilds.com but there are other suppliers out there that might be cheaper. The pieces came oversized but can easily be cut with a circular saw. The nature of the design itself allows for various frame configurations so you can adjust the extrusion proportions to fit your specific needs.\nCarriages and Drivetrain:\nThe X and Y axes move using carriages which reduce friction and make it easy for attaching the extrusions, motors, and other electronics. For the carriage plates, I initially was going to use 1/8\" aluminum plates but wanted to make sure I had a plate design that worked first. I started with 1/8\" 3D printed PLA plates and was happy with the fit so ditched the metal plate idea for the time being. Currently I'm using 1/4\" thick PLA plates which add more rigidity than the 1/8\" ones. The carriages also use V-slot wheels with bearings, which start to get costly as you add them up. However, I've found the wheels to work very well, and they increase the overall machine effectiveness. The motors on each carriage then use a belt drive system to move along the frame.\nFor the Z-axis, I added some V rails to the extrusions so the wheels weren't cantilevered as far from the mounting plate. This axis is also driven using a screw and delrin nut directly attached to a NEMA 23 motor which add some rigidity and more power.\nElectronics:\nI already had a lot of the electronics from my previous build so I stuck with what I had to save some money. The CNC is still powered by an Arduino Uno with CNC shield and stepper drivers. Two NEMA 17 motors power the Y axis while one NEMA 17 motor powers the X axis. The Z axis is powered by a NEMA 23 motor. More information on the electronics box can be found in Step 8.\nCustom Parts:\nDrawings for all the plates are attached to this Instructable so you can CAD them yourself. They're pretty simple and can be easily recreated no matter your CAD level. The parts can then be 3D printed, machined out of aluminum, laser cut, etc... Additionally I've tried to design the plates so they can accept either NEMA 17 or NEMA 23 motors, however I have not tested out most of the NEMA 23 motor holes to see if there are any issues. Some plates also have spots for delrin nut blocks to be mounted on if you'd rather use a threaded rod instead of a belt driven system. Again, this has not been fully tested so there may be issues. You'll also need to design a mount to hold the motors if you want to go the threaded rod route.\nNote that all important dimensions should be included in the drawings, however I did not spend the time to clean up the drawings and bring them up to ANSI standards. There should be enough information included to generate the plates regardless though but let me know if any critical dimensions are missing.\n--------------------------------------------------\nMaterials List:\n- Estimated Cost: ~$325 (not including spindle or laser)\n- See attached Excel file for all parts, prices, and links. All plate files are included in drawing format while more complex parts have the .STP file included. Standard disclaimer: Some parts might be missing from assembly materials lists and images. I've attempted to include everything necessary but I might have missed some parts.\n- Note: A lot of the screws listed are meant to work for 1/8\" thick plates. If you're using 1/4\" thick plates you might need to add counterbores or use longer hardware so everything fits correctly. Additionally, all assembly photos show 1/8\" plates instead of the 1/4\" ones I currently have but the assembly is the same regardless..", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFQ/5Z1P/JT91LKYL/FFQ5Z1PJT91LKYL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Bill of Materials"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Tools Needed\nThe tools used are as follows:\n1.

This makes it easier to troubleshoot everything, however this can still be done if the parts have been placed.\nTest the Electronics\nThe general electronics are a duplicate from my previous machine. Like before, make sure to hook up the power supply correctly, otherwise you may short out the components and could destroy your electronics. For an extra precaution, I initially plugged the power supply into a surge protector.\nTo hook up the supply, I took an old computer power adapter and stripped down the cord so the live, negative and ground wires are showing. Make sure whatever cable you use has a ground connection. You can use a multi-meter to determine which wire is which, or you can consult online sources since most cables are the same. Once I determined which wire is which I labeled them so I didn't get them mixed up later on. I then hooked them up and plugged the power supply into the outlet and measured the output voltage using a multi-meter to ensure I was getting the 24V I needed. My power supply had a potentiometer on it so I tuned the supply to get the value I wanted.\nPrepare the Arduino\nThe next step is to load GRBL onto the Arduino Uno as this is what communicates with the motors and transmits the G-Code to the CNC. I placed the motor shield on top of the Arduino Uno and the motor drivers on top of that. It's best to test one motor and motor driver at a time to ensure GRBL is running correctly. Once you've determined GRBL works, you can hook up the rest of the motors and play with them. I thought this step was pretty cool as it's one of the main things that makes a CNC a CNC. There are various programs online to actually send GCode to the Arduino and most of them are pretty light and self explanatory. I like Grbl-Panel the best (linked below), but there are several other programs available that you can find with a quick search. I also attached a few guides I used for installing GRBL and other electronic troubleshooting:\nLoading GRBL\nConnecting GRBL\nUsing GRBL\nCNC Shield First Run\nAt this point you can also use the jumpers included with the CNC kit for configuring the 4th axis and microstepping. Configuring the 4th axis will tell the shield which axis the motor plugged into the \"A\" port on the board controls. For this CNC, place two jumpers across the Y pins (detailed here under 4th Axis Configuration) since the two motors control the Y axis. Microstepping is discussed further in the next step.\nCAUTION: Make sure the power supply is off when messing with the Arduino and CNC Shield. If you don't then you run the risk of damaging the motor drivers, the shield or even the Arduino. Trust me, I learned this the hard way and it's not fun trying to figure out what's causing the problem.\nFinalized Routing\nOnce I had all the electronics working again I routed the cables to the back right of the machine through various drag chains.\nI then laid out the power supplies and other electronics I wanted to hide in the box so I knew what size I should cut my scrap wood into. My box ended up being 8.5\"W x 5.5\"H x 13\"D and has an acrylic window on the top for easy access. I also incorporated holes in one side of the box for the fan, all four motor connections and a spindle connection. Also on this side of the box I added in a 3 way switch that splits a secondary AC current so I can choose if I want to power an outlet or the spindle. I also plan on adding in a relay to the circuit to allow the Arduino to turn on or off the tool whenever the job starts or stops.\nOn the opposite side of the box there are cutouts for the Arduino connections and a spot for the spindle speed control.\nFinally, the back of the box has the power adapter components so I can easily unplug power for the machine itself or the spindle / outlet current.\nIn the initial design I had powered the fan with the Arduino itself but this meant it was only getting around 5V (less than half of what it's rated for). I added in a 24V to 12V converter so I could power the fan straight from the power supply at its full power making it easy to cool down all the components.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FN3/MTO1/JT91PZAF/FN3MTO1JT91PZAF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1M/B31U/JT91PZAI/F1MB31UJT91PZAI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNN/7ZTI/JT91PZAL/FNN7ZTIJT91PZAL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F05/OQ0Y/JT91PZAO/F05OQ0YJT91PZAO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Electronics Routing"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Once everything's been put together your almost done to run your first test program. However, the CNC won't fully have the right settings, meaning your program won't be accurately executed. The CNC must now be calibrated so it actually goes where the Gcode tells it to. For instance, the CNC doesn't know how far one revolution of the motor actually makes the machine move. To configure this, you need to set the step/mm which tell the motors how far they need to rotate to move the amount specified in the Gcode.\nYou may need to iterate through the step values until you have a value that produces the most accurate results. The main formula you need is:\n(New Step Value A) = (Old Step Value) * (Traveled Distance) / (Measured Distance)\nThe best way to find the step value is:\nSet the step value in GRBL\nMark the machine starting location on each axis using tape or a marker\nUse the software to move the machine a specified amount\nCompare the actual amount moved with the desired amount and use the above formula to calculate the new step value. For example, you may tell the machine to move 1\" but it really measures out to be 0.75\" so use the formula to find the new step value.\nRepeat until you have an actual movement value that matches the desired value (i.e. you tell the machine to move 1\" and it actually moves 1\" in that direction)\nYou can also use microstepping which makes the movement smoother at a loss of torque. For this reason, it's best to minimize the overall machine friction in order to have the smoothest movement possible. To incorporate this, you need to connect the appropriate jumpers on the CNC shield and adjust the step value. The new formula you'll need is:\n(New Step Value B) = (New Step Value A) / (Microstepping Fraction) where New Step Value A is still calculated using the formula above.\nFor my machine I used the following settings:\nX-Axis: 24.482 step/mm (Microstep = 1/4)\nY-Axis: 21.122 step/mm (Microstep = 1/4)\nZ-Axis: 49.248 step/mm (Microstep = 1/2)\nI also used the following links for reference:\nStepper Motor Calculations\nCalibrating GRBL\nGBRLInterfacing Programs\nThe following programs can be used to set GRBL settings and send the G-Code:\nGRBL Panel\nCandle\nGCode Sender\n\nIf Your Stepper Motors Aren't Moving\nIf your motors are plugged in but they don't move when you send the commands, make sure the correct current or voltage is being sent to the stepper drivers. You can measure this with a multimeter as mentioned here, then adjust the potentiometer until the correct value is achieved. Your should run the motors per the specifications. If you go over these values you run the risk of damaging the motors or stepper drivers. Also make sure all your electrical connections are sufficient. This can be tedious but sometimes inspecting one component at a time is the best way to find the culprit for your problems.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSM/33D0/JTCSL5LT/FSM33D0JTCSL5LT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWT/PP9M/JTCSL5M3/FWTPP9MJTCSL5M3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Configure the Electronics"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "Now comes the fun part: MAKE STUFF! For this you just need to create a design, make the Gcode, and send this to the machine. There are many different ways to create the code, but I've found success using Easel which is meant for the XCarve, however you can just change the settings to match your machine and export the Gcode. The basic steps for running the machine after generating Gcode is as follows:\nSecure your work piece to the wasteboard.\nMove the machine to the furthest point of your work piece relative to the homed location (machine zero). Lower the Z-Axis so it just touches the work piece.\nZero the machine. Your work coordinates should now be zero (work zero).\nRun the Gcode.\nEasel runs you through these steps so it should be pretty straight forward. I also run the Gcode before having any tools in to avoid damaging the tool if the Gcode isn't quite right, or I just use a scrap piece of material rather than wasting the actual work piece. I quickly tested the machine by laser engraving a square and then doing a test cut using the spindle. Some of the feed settings and depth cuts still need to be optimized but other than that the square came out well.\n--------------------------------------------------\nClamps:\nThere are many different types of clamps out there so it mainly depends on user preference. I like the ones made by Marius Hornberger or you can find ones on Thingiverse too. Alternatively you can also use tape but make sure the workpiece is securely fastened to the wasteboard so it doesn't fly off.\nTips and Tricks:\nIf the motors are skipping steps try adjusting the voltages. The motors may not be getting enough voltage/current.\nRegularly check the belts to make sure they're still tensioned\nIf you use a relay then put M3 at the beginning of your Gcode and M5 at the end to turn the power to the outlet ON or OFF respectively. This is especially useful if you're using a laser so the laser doesn't drag across the workpiece and cause unwanted burn marks.\nIf your machine isn't moving very quickly or movement seems clunky, try adjusting GRBL settings. I found success in changing the acceleration and speed until I got movement I was happy with.\nPossible Improvements:\nUse NEMA 23 motors on all axes for more power\nSwitch from belt drive to threaded rods for more reliability and precision\nUse a knob instead of a coupler on top of the Z-axis to make it more ergonomical\n--------------------------------------------------\nThat's it you're all done creating and setting up your own CNC!

I wanted to use the power button on the battery pack, but I didn't want to try and rewire anything as that's not really my strong suit. So I came up with a button extension of sorts. I needed to make a dowel that had a narrow section on the top and a wider section on the bottom or a stepped dowel.\nIn order to do this I used a brass rod to cut in to a wood dowel which created the stepped dowel. The brass tube has one end that is sharpened, kind of, basically I chucked the brass rod in my drill and tapered the end with a file to thin out the wall and \"sharpen\" the edge. Its not perfect but works well enough for this task. I cleaned up the dowel with a razor blade.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F79/LJ3K/JTCRKNYA/F79LJ3KJTCRKNYA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIA/KQDR/JTCRKNYE/FIAKQDRJTCRKNYE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI4/PKJI/JTCRKNYH/FI4PKJIJTCRKNYH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAJ/X3CO/JTCRKNYZ/FAJX3COJTCRKNYZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6R/UM9Z/JTCRKNZ4/F6RUM9ZJTCRKNZ4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10:"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "I did a dry fit with all the pieces.

You can see in the last pic the small wooden button.\nSo this works because the actual power button has a bit of a springiness to it, it has a nice click to it.

It's very easy to fall into the trap of 'designing as you go' but this does make the implementation much longer and can be risky should you come up against any unforeseen issues that a robust design would identify.\nThere's no reason why you can't hand draw your design with a pen and paper, but I prefer using a 3D modelling software like Sketchup. This allows you to draw everything to the exact scale, and also take measurements off the model once it has been drawn.\nIf you're new to using Sketchup I would recommend spending some time working through their free YouTube tutorials I found it easy to use and picked it up quite quickly.\nTo start drawing your area in Sketchup measure everything you can and put this into your model. I started by doing a few hand drawn sketches of the area then marking the drawing up after crawling around the space with a tape measure.\nOnce the space is modeled you can then start on the design of your drawers. You can then transfer each section onto a cutting plan that will help you to estimate how much materials you will need, and how to cut the sheets of wood for minimal waste.\nThe Sketchup file for this set of draws can be downloaded in this step.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FY8/JYYB/JT91OIZL/FY8JYYBJT91OIZL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F73/N4LS/JT91OIYI/F73N4LSJT91OIYI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Measuring Your Space and Designing in 3D."}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Note: If the wall under the stairs is made of brick rather than plasterboard (drywall) in my case, you may want to start demolition of the wall in the next step first.\nThe frame that holds the drawer runners is made out of 4\"x2\" timber. Cut a housing (dado) into the upright pieces that would support the horizontal supports at each end and screw these uprights into a piece of 4\"x2\" that will fix to the floor. It is important that the horizontal supports are supported from the top and the bottom with the housing (dado) to prevent them coming away with a see-saw action when a heavy drawer is fully extended.\nOnce you have the uprights installed at the front and back you can install the horizontal cross members the the drawer runners will fix to. Before fixing down it is important to spend the time to ensure all your horizontal pieces are square, level, and all parallel with each other. This will ensure the drawer runners are parallel when fully extended.\nWhen fixing everything down it's best to fix in as many places as possible to make this as rigid as possible. This frame is going to take the weigh of the drawers so it is not ideal if there is any room for movement or vibration. In my case I used a lot of metal \"L\" brackets to support this frame from all angles. This was mainly because my walls and floor were not square and these brackets allowed a square frame to be fixed to a wonky wall.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSC/A142/JT91QU2H/FSCA142JT91QU2H.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Making the Frame"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Bravery test!

Don't worry too much about the rough edge, this will be covered with your PVC angle later in the project.\nYou could also use a jig saw here. I opted for the hand saw as I felt it would make less mess and would be easier to control.

If your drawer runners are not level and parallel your drawers could be stiff and difficult to open and close.\nOffer your first run up to the first horizontal support and use a clamp to hold in place. The clamp needs to be firm enough to hold it and allow some wiggle room to make adjustments. Use a spirit level to make sure this is as level as possible. Once level screw it in place.\nWhen installing the 2nd runner in the pair, follow the same process by clamping in place, but this time you will need to ensure it is not only level but at the same height as the first level. Use a spirit level across the two runners to make sure they are at the same height. Once in position it can be screwed in place.\nNow that both runners are screwed in place it is worth fully extending the runners and checking that they are not only level with each other, but that they are parallel. You can do this by measuring the distance between them at the front and back to ensure the distance is the same. You can then go one step further by measuring diagonally from the front of one runner the back of the next, and making sure this is the same for both sides.\nIn one case I had runners that were not parallel so I used some penny washers to pack out the back of one set of runners to bring them parallel with the 2nd in the pair.\nIt is possible to now leave these and move onto building the drawers, however I went one step further and mounted a strip of 1\"x2\" timber onto each drawer runner, and installed a cross piece between them, so that I had a sliding solid base that the drawers can sit on and fix to.

Up to 15 cuts for free and a small fee for additional cuts providing they are all straight line cuts and not on pieces too small. I found all the cuts on the large sheets were accurate to the exact measurement I gave. I only used this service to cut down the large sheets so they were small enough for me to get them home.\nTIP: If you model each piece you need to cut out in the Sketchup model, you can get the most pieces out of your sheet of wood with the least waste.\nI used a table saw to cut each piece out. You can also use a hand circular saw with a straight edge if you don't have a table saw, or you could try your hand at cutting with a hand saw if you're brave enough to cut a straight line.\nTo find the angle of the stairs, I used an angle finder which I transferred over to the table saw sled.\nTIP: If using a circular saw or table saw with plywood, you're likely to get some splintering on your cuts. To overcome this you can make the cut in 2 passes. The first pass with the saw at half the dept of the wood, and the second finish off the cut.

These are the pieces which you will see the screw head in. Next, using a drill bit slightly smaller than the thread of the screw, align your two pieces and mark the receiving piece with your smaller dill bit.\nOnce you have all your holes marked out, drill a pilot hole deep enough to take the entire shaft of the screw. As plywood is multiple pieces of wood sheets glued together, if you are to screw into the end grain without a pilot hole you will force the single sheets apart and your plywood will split. A decent pilot hole will prevent this from happening.\nLastly, make sure you are using a screw that is partially threaded. That is a thread for most of the shaft but a smooth section of the shaft by the head of the screw that will not bite into the top piece of wood. This will allow the pieces to be pulled together when you screw them up tight.\nI started by fixing the bottom and two sides of the drawers together first.

You could now just screw down from the top into the timber bases, however you will see the screw heads on your drawer surface so a cleaner look will be to screw up from the bottom.\nTo do this, use wood clamps to hold the drawer to the base so that both drawer and base will stay attached to each other and you can use the release mechanisms on the drawer runners to remove both parts from the frame under the stairs.\nOnce removed you can drill a pilot hole from the bottom and screw into place.\nTIP: If screwing in from the bottom, make sure you check the length of the screw isn't going to piece through to the top side of the bottom shelf on the drawer.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FA2/NWUN/JT91QTVR/FA2NWUNJT91QTVR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYV/LB80/JT91OIL0/FYVLB80JT91OIL0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRL/B9JG/JT91QTUN/FRLB9JGJT91QTUN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFA/OEG3/JT91QTU9/FFAOEG3JT91QTU9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Fixing the Drawer Units Into Place"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "The front panels are the decorative fronts that you will see when the drawers are closed. I used a thinner sheet of MDF for my drawers. I chose MDF as it has a smooth finish and I wouldn't have to do too much to prep it to make it look like its part of a hidden drawer.\nI checked the measurements twice for this piece, and allowed for a 5mm gap around each drawer front. Rather than cutting each drawer front individually, I cut a piece to fit in the the space where the wall was and then cut down into drawer sections last. This meant I would have accurate edges that would align perfectly.\nI cut the sheet down on the table saw so that the bottom and sides were the right size. The sheet was too large to cut the angle of the table saw sled, so I used a circular saw and a straight edge to cut the angled edge.\nTIP: Cutting MDF with power tools can usually cause burning on the edges. I find that making the cutting blade as shallow as possible reduces the amount of burning on the edges.\nOnce the sheet is the right size it can be cut into the pieces to cover the front of the drawers. At this point it's worth checking it fits and checking where each drawer starts and finishes to make sure you're cutting in the right place.\nUsing the longer edge against the rip fence, cut this piece down on the table saw.\nLastly, using a chamfer bit in a router will give the edges a clean edge that will be less likely to suffer damage from minor bumps from everyday use.\nTo fix the front panel to the drawer, first wedge the drawer forward so that the drawer is sticking out and you have a solid edge to push against. Use a small amount of hot glue on the MDF front panel and stick it to the drawer that is sticking out. If your hot glue gun is set to a hot temperature you will have 10-20 seconds working time before it dried solid. Use this time to align the front panels so that they fit in place perfectly.\nOnce the front panels are held in place you can drive a series of small screws in through the drawer front to the front panel to hold firmly in place.\nTIP: Once again, drilling a pilot hole in the MDF will help the screw catch and not rip out the MDF.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVL/923X/JT91QTTL/FVL923XJT91QTTL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP0/NBG3/JT91OIQI/FP0NBG3JT91OIQI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL5/NWUA/JT91QTT5/FL5NWUAJT91QTT5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOE/82UW/JT91OIVD/FOE82UWJT91OIVD.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Making the Front Panels"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "There are a variety of push to latches available.

THIS is why everything takes so much longer than it should!\nSoooo.... yeah...The tool works, but even after removing all the clearance in the holes and slots there's still just a bit of tolerance I can't seem to get rid of with the sliding design. And... I made the mistake of borrowing a professional version of this tool from a friend to see how it works. So this \"tolerance stackup\" is enough to annoy me now that I know the \"real\" version works better. Wiferneer also ran across a metal commercial sliding style divider tool at a sewing expo about this time and we saw the same tolerance stackup with the commercial version that is in our homebrew version.\nSigh. Back to the drawing board...\nThe tool I borrowed works well. There isn't noticeable or measurable (with a tape measure) slack. The main difference I see is that it uses a pivioting motion on the pointer legs instead of a sliding motion.\nWith this observation, I changed directions from a sliding style divider tool to a pivoting style divider tool. This doesn't look as neat, isn't as fun to use, isn't as clean to mark intervals since the tip is canted - but it removed a little more tolerance and it reduced the number of parts to assemble so we'll call it a win.\nAttached to this step is the re-remix V8, a pivoting style equal distance divider tool.\nThis is the one I'm personally using in my shop.\nAssembly of V8 is easier than V7, there's only two layers to stack and that means there's also only one size of chicago screw needed. Basically criss-cross a pointer leg and a connector leg to assemble. Insert a chicago screw and then Loctite the screws when you're done. I forgot to take pictures during the assembly so unfortunately we'll have to use the picture of the tool expanded for the assembly reference.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FW6/U31R/JSL3BEJI/FW6U31RJSL3BEJI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9S/153G/JTEN33Q6/F9S153GJTEN33Q6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB0/F0B5/JSL3BCWN/FB0F0B5JSL3BCWN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F23/T2XW/JT91VTQL/F23T2XWJT91VTQL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFL/K9AZ/JSL3BD18/FFLK9AZJSL3BD18.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWJ/XZHG/JSL3B147/FWJXZHGJSL3B147.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Redirect, Remix the Remix"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "It works!\nOK, I know you have questions, so here's some questions I asked myself while working on this re-mix.\n1) Self - Why can't the tip of the divider just be a normal triangle? Answer - Dear Self, The tip has a straight edge so you can draw a straight line to mark on your workpiece. Duh...\n1a) In the pivoting version this is less of a thing since the tips angle sideways instead of slide up and down.\n2) (OK, I can't do third person anymore...) Why are there scallops on the divider leg of the sliding version but not on the other legs? Answer - The chicago screws need to be able to nest into this piece in order to fully collapse the tool. Checkout the picture.\n3) Do you think this will be as accurate as the commercial versions? Answer - Probably not. This version is made of wood and there has to be some \"tolerance\" to allow the screws to rotate. However, I'd bet it's just as accurate as using a tape measure to do the same layout job and it's faster.\n4) You list polyurethane in the materials section, but this tool doesn't look finished? What gives? Answer - I need to stop using it for a couple days so I can take it apart and put a coat of poly on it to make it last longer!\n5) Why is the metal version so much taller?

Traditional mortise/tenon, pocket screws, or dowel joinery could also work for this build.\nFor the stopped dovetails, a one time use jig was created. This allowed me to be able to accurately locate the sliding dovetails on both the front and back rail to ensure that the riser pieces to raise the top were located exactly opposite of each other. The sliding dovetails were cut using a dovetail bit in the router, a collet, and the one time use jig.

I then cut a 45 degree angle at the top of the pieces. I started the cut about an inch from the back of the board.\nThen I cut the back of the organizer. The back piece was 14.5\u201d by 15\u201d. I wanted the full width to be 16\u201d. When the first three pieces were cut I moved on to cutting the slots for the dividers.\nOf course we know that wrenches come in all sorts of shapes and sizes so the so the size of the slots in my pliers organizer can be different as well. I made my slots between 1\u201d and 1.5\u201d. Most regular pliers will fit in an one inch slot but some do call for a little more room. I used my sliding miter saw to cut shallow channels an inch apart. I find that two passes of my saw blade makes a channel wide enough for a 1/4\u201d piece of ply. I cut all my channels and then checked to make sure the plywood would slide into each one. If there was one that was too tight, I went back to the saw and went over it one more time.

Assemble! I used TotalBoat 2:1 mix high performance epoxy resin for this because it cures clear and is super workable. Now let's talk about epoxy resin for a bit. It's formulated to be used in thin layers because it's an exothermic reaction which builds up heat (max of about 1/2\"). If you pour it too thick, it will overheat and boil, crack, and/or possibly split up your marriage. So why am I using epoxy for such a large resin casting? Almost entirely just because I was told that it wouldn't work. Spite is kind of on-brand for me I guess.\nI start with the bottom section of the screwdriver, the blue section. Now I need to do this in multiple pours to build up the layers, so I need to ensure that the color is identical with each layer or you will be able to seeing the layers super easily. The way that I solved this problem is by mixing the blue dye in with the resin part of the mix and then combine with hardener just the amount I need for each layer. That way, the remaining blue resin is the same color and won't cure since I haven't mixed it all with hardener yet.\nI mix enough volume to be roughly equivalent to a 1/2\" layer around the outside of the form. This mix gets put in my vacuum chamber to pull out all of the bubbles. Luckily, I use a slow cure hardener which gives me about 40 minutes of working time. The bubbles take about 30 minutes to pull out, which gives me just enough time to pour it into the form.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3A/13OF/JT91JL51/F3A13OFJT91JL51.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRX/QM4E/JT91JL72/FRXQM4EJT91JL72.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFZ/0VM1/JT91JLAF/FFZ0VM1JT91JLAF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: Preparing the Epoxy"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "After my 30 minute timer goes off, I pour the epoxy into my silicone form. The top is closed up with some plexiglass just because I'm curious to see what's going on inside. I also use a piece of scrap wood to span corner to corner so that I can use the tailstock on the lathe to support the box on the lathe.\nNow is where this project fails or succeeds... I slowly turn up the speed of the lathe so that the epoxy will spread out and turn it up to 600 rpm to get it going fast enough that the epoxy is pushed to the outside of the form (which you can actually see here!). Now let's back up a second, why am I doing this? Main reason is because if I just poured 1/2\" layers directly in the bottom of the form and built it up from there, there would be subtle layer lines on the screwdriver. Doing it like this, the layer lines are on the end and almost invisible. This also had the side benefit of letting me pour essentially twice as much because I get a 1/2\" layer all the way around which is equivalent to 1\" in thickness. Going into this I actually talked to the TotalBoat technical reps because neither of us were actually sure if this technique would work because the epoxy might react funny to rotating once it hits the gel stage in the curing process. I figured if I got it rotating fast enough, gravity should be negligible compared to the force pushing out on the form so I decided to give it a shot.\nSuccess!! This is after a few pours already. I leave the form spinning on the lathe for an hour before I pour in the next layer. I was just guessing on this set time, but after it looked good on the first layer I just stuck to it. You want to make sure that you are pouring the next layer while the previous layer is still in the gel stage to ensure that they will bond together. This actually worked out nicely because I just set a timer to go off every 30 minutes and I would mix up a batch of epoxy and then put it in the pressure pot after 30 and then after that has been spinning for 30 I would mix up the next batch to have it ready after the previous pour has been on the lathe for an hour.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOB/3Q7E/JT91JLDQ/FOB3Q7EJT91JLDQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F09/6DAW/JT91JLJ5/F096DAWJT91JLJ5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZD/EF36/JT91JLVZ/FZDEF36JT91JLVZ.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif"], "step_title": "Step 11: Epoxy Pouring Adventure"}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "Rinse and repeat the same process for the clear part of the handle (except with no dye this time) and then once the whole piece is cured, I can pop it out of the form.

I put that aside and made a new casting, I figure I'll turn the dud into one of those Craftsman screwdriver handled bottle openers instead. Not for giant bottles though, because the metal bit will be the same size as the regular one... I just like the idea of that visual.\nThe ends of the epoxy castings that were the top of the form are a little lumpy just because that's where I poured it in, so I flatten both of them on the disk sander.

Not the worst thing in the world because that profile is already defined by where the clear epoxy that I poured to join the pieces meets the blue epoxy of the bottom section.

This is the easiest way I've found on larger circles where typical jigs won't fit anymore (plus the outside is slightly irregular still at this point).\nIf you don't account for the mess that this left behind after, this was a really fun part of the process. The shank is bit is going to be 1\" bar stock, so I just pick the forstner bit that is slightly larger than the diagonal of that piece and go to town drilling. You just need to make sure not to push it because you can overheat the epoxy. I'm realizing now that I should have just left the center of this part hollow, but wasn't it worth the confetti show? Probably not, my apologies. So I'm not long enough, no surprise there. If you look at the regular screwdriver, the bit actually extends a bit into the clear part of the handle a decent amount.

The holes were drilled with a forstner bit, but the EMT was undersized, so I had to pad it out with electrical tape in order to get a snug fit.\n\nThe Achilles heel was mounting the 2x4s on their face, as opposed to their edge. I didn't want to waste 3 1/2\" of the already shallow 11\" space behind the door, so I gave it a shot. 1 1/2\" of attachment between the wood and pipe just isn't enough, so they ended up sagging unevenly.\n\nWhen the time came to upgrade, I looked at the common metal lumber rack kits, but most have 5-6 horizontal supports, which are fixed. I wanted adjustability for tighter spacing, so I wasn't always burying the board I wanted under 37 others.\n\nMy solution was metal track shelving components from the home center. I bought two 72\" lengths of track and cut them each in half to fit my space. The brackets are sold individually and are available in a few different depths (6.75\", 9.53\", 11.75\", 14.86\", 18.96\"). I went with 11.75\" since that's what fit my available space and I started with 12 brackets. If/when I want to add more shelves, it's just a quick trip to the store.\n\nI started with four equally spaced shelves, but I'm able to adjust them and add/remove as necessary depending on current wood inventory.

May I suggest ... sacrificial OSB wall panels.\n\nI have two floor to ceiling wall panels and one partial panel. The panel by the table saw is built like a standard wall because a 2\" PVC pipe runs through it and it's held against the wall with two blocks screwed into the joists. The other panels have the 2x4 framing laying on face, keeping them tighter to the wall to conserve space. (1 1/2\" as opposed to 3 1/2\"). The wall behind the drum sander is tied into a corner post of the house and a pipe chase, while the partial wall is secured to a rim joist.\n\nI skin my panels with 1/2\" OSB primarily because it's less expensive and lighter than plywood, but I've found that it holds screws just as well.

It seems like such a simple and elegant solution - just attach some parallel strips to the wall, which have a 45 degree angle cut on the top. Then make tool hangers with the complimentary angle cut and you are off to the races.\n\nFor me, this was a false sense of adjustability and flexibility. I thought I'd be able move tools around as acquired and keep things tightly nested, but in actuality, I ended up with wasted space due to tool lengths causing collisions.\n\nA slightly better option would be slot wall. Less wasted space, but still the need to make custom holders that integrate with your chosen slot wall (not standard) for each new tool acquisition.\n\nThe method which is working for me is just securing things directly to the wall. This allows me to position items exactly where I want them to make use of all available space. Tool holders are screwed to the wall, combination squares hang on a magnetic strip, and for pegs, I use modified drywall screws [see next step].\n\nI didn't entirely eliminate the use a french cleats. My chisel storage rack [Fig. 6] and saw blade cabinet have integrated cleats (glued and nailed in place), so I just screwed a necessary length of cleat to the wall. I also have one row of cleat above my sanding area, which I use to hang strap clamps and drum shells during work [Fig. 7]\n\nI've also repurposed a few office organizers.

I'm hyper-organized. I like clutter free spaces, dedicated storage, economy of motion, efficiency, and enjoying myself in the workshop. The last thing I want to do is dig through piles of junk looking for tools and materials.\n\nStep one to eliminating clutter ... give everything a home. Most of us employ this practice daily in a room we call \"the kitchen.\" Aside from a few lunatics (Kevin), it's safe to say that everyone has system when it comes to the kitchen. Dishware in this cabinet, glasses in this cabinet, canned goods over here, spices over there, etc. It's really easy to use that same approach in a workshop.\n\nWhen you have dedicated storage for tools, materials, and supplies, you're more likely to put them away, which means you'll know where to find them in the future. When your pancakes are burning on side one, I bet you know exactly were to find the spatula and have it in hand within seconds. You aren't running around the room looking in every cabinet while the delectable treats burn to an inedible crisp. You shouldn't have to frantically search for a clamp, marking gauge, or a damp rag during a glue up, nor should you be searching for screws or other materials mid project when you are in the creative zone.\nPertinent examples:\nI keep commonly used 1lbs boxed screws in a shop made storage rack [Fig. 1]\nSmall hardware (nuts, bolts, washers, etc) are in Harbor Freight storage cases [Fig. 2]\nDrum hardware (lugs, bolts, washers, vents, etc) live in Gladiator storage bins [Fig. 3].\nI'll take it a step further by renouncing the use of tool cases/bags. Back in the day, tools came in plastic cases for storage and transport, which is nice if you move job sites all the time, but in a stationary workshop, they become a hindrance. They are rarely a uniform size and even if you do manage to stack them, the next tool you need will be on the bottom. The bags are even worse because they are oddly shaped and deform when you look at them. It only took me a few weeks of pulling tools in and out of cases before I decided they were a waste of time and space. Now most of my tools have their home in plain sight, so it's just grab and go.\nPertinent examples:\nBulky and/or rarely used tools are stored on a shelf under the miter station - circular saws, corded angle grinder, finish nailer, and jigsaw [Fig. 4].\nThe Festool Domino in it's case since it has multiple accessories and is actually a useful container.\nMy drills and impact drivers have integrated belt clips, which I use to hang them on the tool wall instead of building a larger storage caddy [Fig. 4].\nMy drills and impact drivers have integrated belt clips, which I use to hang them on the tool wall instead of building a larger storage caddy [Fig. 5].\nOther handheld power tools are hung on the tool wall using the sprinkler pipe pegs - brad nailer, pin nailer, cordless grinder, glue gun [Fig. 6].\nAlso, drawers are evil. If you want to misplace and eventually forget something even exists ... put it in a drawer. I used to have a drawer under my router table for the wrenches, bits, a depth gauge, and some calipers. It never failed that the item I wanted was buried at the bottom. The only set of drawers that still resides in the shop is a short filing cabinet, which is primarily used as the stand for my OSS.\nPertinent examples:\nInfrequently used router accessories are kept in the affore mentioned filing cabinet drawers - bases, edge guides, table pins, older bits [Fig. 7].\nRouter wrenches are stored by their router in plain site by using neodymium magnets [Fig. 8 & 9].", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FI6/BBN2/JT4TPCYZ/FI6BBN2JT4TPCYZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRS/8C77/JT4TPCZB/FRS8C77JT4TPCZB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSG/UFHM/JT4TPCZO/FSGUFHMJT4TPCZO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0K/PI7M/JT4TPCSQ/F0KPI7MJT4TPCSQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFU/WLAH/JT4TPCST/FFUWLAHJT4TPCST.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6F/QNWR/JT4TPCTH/F6FQNWRJT4TPCTH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEX/ULY0/JSYZBU8U/FEXULY0JSYZBU8U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRI/CLHX/JT4TPCTV/FRICLHXJT4TPCTV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ6/135Z/JT4TPCTU/FZ6135ZJT4TPCTU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Every Tool Needs a Home ... and Not in a Drawer"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "My small space dictates where most of the stationary tools are placed, but I still put some thought into it.\nPertinent examples:\nThe table saw is near the door with ample open space on the infeed side. It abuts the workbench/assembly table, which therefore functions as the outfeed table.\nThe jointer is directly under the lumber rack - tucked behind the door in an otherwise unusable space.\nThe miter saw is against a long wall with space on both sides for long stock and has direct/open access from the door.\nThe bandsaw is nested against the assembly table. Because they differ in height, there are no obstacles on the outfeed side.\nOnce placement was established for these large tools, I filled in the voids with the remaining tools. Is a corner the best placement for a drill press? Not really, but when the need to drill longer stock arises, I just pull it out from the wall. I'd also prefer to have my drum sander next to the rest of the sanding tools, but it doesn't fit. It's tucked in an opposite corner, which works for most of the projects I make. When I'm fabricating trim molding for the house and need space for long stock, I just roll it into the space in front of the table saw.\nSmall Shop Tip: Put everything on wheels. Even if you don't plan on moving tools, invest in the future. You'll be able to easily rearrange, reposition tools for large material, and even move tools for deep cleaning.\n\nI'm of the opinion that tool grouping is more important than overall layout. In the kitchen, the oven/stove is the stationary tool. It stands to reason that most of us store pots and pans within close proximity and they are all stored together - not spread out like an easter egg hunt. I make it a point to store all similar tools and their accessories in one spot.\nPertinent examples:\nIn a back corner of the shop, I have my sanding zone. The two stationary tools are the oscillating belt/spindle sander and a downdraft table. Every other sander also lives in that zone. 1\" strip sander on the tabletop, orbital sander hangs on the wall, belt sander and detail sander sit on shelf under the table [Fig. 2]\nNote: The drum sander is an exception due to space limitations.\nAll drill bits are stored on a rack next to the drill press [Fig. 3].\nBandsaw blades are hung next to the saw [Fig.4]\nPush sticks, insert plates, and brake cartridges are stored by the table saw.\nRouter bits, wrenches, and router lift tools are all stored on or next to the router table.\n\nTo further demonstrate my extreme organizational practices, I store all pertinent sleds and jigs next to their related tool. They all have a permanent storage location and if they aren't within direct reach, they are no more than a few steps away.\nPertinent examples:\nAll marking gauges and small handheld tools are stored on the tool wall adjacent to the assembly table.\nDrilling jigs are stored on the wall panel behind the drill press [Fig. 3].\nA small bandsaw sled sits on the PVC dust collection run by the saw [Fig. 4].\nAn ever growing collection of sleds are stored on the wall panel adjacent to the table saw [Fig. 5].\nCustom jigs for drum making are stored on a wall, which is just a few steps from the tablesaw and workbench/assembly table [Fig. 6].\nJig Tip: Label your jigs with their purpose, as well as any specific use information. Take my 6 Pack Groove-In-Ator 1.0 jig as an example [Fig. 7]. If I hadn't labeled it, I wouldn't remember it's function. If it weren't for the fact that I recorded it's birth date, I wouldn't remember when I made it. Luckily for me, past BALES denoted the required router bit and base (thanks, buddy). He even marked a center line, so the jig can be quickly aligned to the work piece.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPF/LNM4/JSYZBV4C/FPFLNM4JSYZBV4C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F38/8JNH/JSYZBV44/F388JNHJSYZBV44.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUO/28SC/JSYZBV37/FUO28SCJSYZBV37.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJZ/G5OE/JSYZBV38/FJZG5OEJSYZBV38.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD5/M8EW/JSYZC4X7/FD5M8EWJSYZC4X7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6O/HWQ0/JSYZBU8N/F6OHWQ0JSYZBU8N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUX/OJKL/JT4TPD0G/FUXOJKLJT4TPD0G.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Tool Placement and Accessory Symbiosis"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "This one goes against my tool grouping ideology, but hear me out.\n\nI've seen large clamp racks on walls, as well as clamp racks on casters that you can ride around the shop like a scooter, but I don't have the need, nor the space (for the clamp rack ... I'll totally take the scooter).\n\nI think I started with 4 clamps and just stored them towards the top of my tool wall. As the projects grew, the collection grew, but space on the wall diminished. It also became painfully obvious that I always needed a clamp when they were all out of reach, so I started spreading some around the shop.\n\nI have found that for my workflow, large bar clamps, K body clamps, and F-clamps, can be stored in a solitary location.

I made one horizontal run along two walls of the shop using 2\" pipe. The solitary turn is accomplished with a sweeping 45 degree fitting and wye fittings are used for the tool drops. 2\" flexible couplers/boots connect the PVC to aluminum blast gates and then 2 1/2\" flex hose ties into each tool.\nNote: Some people insist that PVC needs to be grounded. I've seen several methods using copper wire - some inside the pipe and others on the outside of the pipe. My system is not grounded. I've never experienced static build up, never been shocked, and nothing has blown up.\n\nThis set up is surprisingly effective. It kept up with all of my stationary tools until I upgraded from a job site saw to a professional cabinet saw. It's also no match for handheld routing. Space is still a concern for me, so I'm considering a dedicated wall mounted dust collector for the table saw.\n\nFor overall air quality, I use a Jet air filtration system [Model AFS-1000B], which is centrally mounted above my work bench. I was shocked at how much of a difference it actually makes, so I highly recommend it as an addition to any workshop. Several companies make them at this point (Grizzly, Shop Fox, Rikon, Powertec), so the cost has dropped to around $200. WEN has a unit around $150.\n\nMy manual collection system is a dual attack - buckets and a brush. The buckets are for off cuts and prior to using them, I'd just toss pieces onto the floor, which I would then have to pick up later. Buckets keep the floor clean, probably reduce accidents, and are easy to empty into the fire pit once full. I have one next to the bandsaw/miter saw zone and one next to the table saw. The brush comes in handy for cleaning the dust off of the workbench and table saw mid project.\n\nBottom line IMO: Some dust collection is always better than no dust collection.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FV0/VBLK/JSYZBV3X/FV0VBLKJSYZBV3X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF9/UPE8/JSYZBV3Y/FF9UPE8JSYZBV3Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVQ/WVV4/JSYZBV40/FVQWVV4JSYZBV40.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB5/891X/JSYZBV3Z/FB5891XJSYZBV3Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDD/QZZJ/JSYZBV31/FDDQZZJJSYZBV31.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8A/69XX/JSYZBV35/F8A69XXJSYZBV35.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYJ/2DBS/JSYZBV41/FYJ2DBSJSYZBV41.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Dust Collection"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "I'm in the habit of putting on safety glasses and ear protection when I enter the shop and leaving them on until I quit for the day, but it was a struggle in the beginning.

The cord is also a safety hazard unless you run it under your shirt.

It is based on simple hexagonal geometry and it's triangular division. The angles of the triangle in a hexagon gives proper support to the books lying on them. I chose cardboard because of it's strength due to corrugation. It is potentially a good material to explore and work with.\nI like to work with a combination of geometry, physics and materials. It is an amazing combo if explored to it's fullest.

The micro car is mainly remote controlled but it has ultrasonic obstacle sensor inputs and capability to make decisions upon those inputs therefore is able to sort of steer and drive itself.\nDuring the production of this 30cm micro car, the time required for printing was so long and processing parts was so boring and difficult i realized that 3d printing a 1.5 long car would be almost impossible for me with the capabilities at hand such as my small Anet a8 3d printer and the makeshift workshop which i currently have access to.

Based on my sausage fingers I added enough space around the outside to allow me to grab them and also slip them into the cabinets easily but you can adjust those measurements according to your bins. I have seen other examples of this type of storage made for the harbor freight containers and that works just as well.\nOnce you figure out the inside dimensions everything else is designed around those numbers. For my bench I could fit four stacks of bins so I made two of these double-stack boxes and one extra at the end that was not wide enough to hold the bins. The boards you use can be anything - plywood works great and here I used some leftover scrap from some unfinished furniture. Make some standoffs to hold the bins as well, a lot of them. I had a bunch of 1/2\" ply and ripped it to 1-1/2\" wide and eased off the inside corner before sanding them a bit. I made 8 smaller ones at 1-1/8\" wide for the bottoms that don't get put into a slot.\nI cut some rabbets around the back edges so I could use 1/4\" plywood for the backer board. You could also be lazy and just pin the back on but I had the blade on already so why not get fancy. Then with the dado blade set to the same width as 1/2\" plywood cut the dados across the boards at 3/8\" deep to hold the standoffs. When measuring from the bottom you don't cut a slot for the first one because the edge of the board is too close. Instead you just lay a standoff in the corner after everything is together. But you have to allow for the skipped one when you measure up - basically you want 3/4\" for the bottom board then 1/2\" for the standoff then 2 1/4\" for the bin before you cut the first slot. Then another one at 2-1/4\" inch apart and so on until you get the last one that will be the bottom rest for the top bin. That determines the height of your overall cabinet as well.

Glue the standoffs into the dados using an extra piece of plywood laid across them as a caul to hold them down. You can see in the fourth pic here where the smaller standoffs are glued into the corner to complete the set.\nAfter I had my cabinets together I didn't really like the edges so I added some small strips of aspen to the front to match the workbench.

Make the support as long as all of your cabinets put together and the width the same as the cabinet depth. Also choose your 2x4 studs for the support carefully - since it will be holding a lot of weight across the gap you need some good wood.

Converting the scooter/truck to RC is all done, My original plan was rather basic..the scooters speed n direction was a handle bar mounted thumb lever, push forward and pull back respectively for travel. I planned to remount this under the cab n connect it to an rc servo via a control rod, prob would of worked but the scooters controller was old n did cut out now n then. So in the bin it went.\nThe scooter is 24v and its motor rated at 650w. So, i need to know how many amps the motor will pull under full load and source a controller of a higher rating, so, 650w\u00f724v=27A. I need to find an rc speed controller rated at 24v input and have an output capable of delivering over 30A . Straight away input voltage of this in RC is classed as High Voltage(HV). It needed to have a reverse function and needed to be for a brushed motor. Rc is usually either brushed or brushless, two or three motor wires respectively. Unbeleivably i found exactly what i needed, in the form of a HV speed controller for an RC boat. I used a watt meter and found under full load the motor pulled 23A. The controller i purchased was an 'Mtroniks Viper Marine40 HV' (40A) . i fitted inline 30A fuses just before the motor to further protect 80 quids worth of speed controller !\nSteering was the next big issue. A Servo to turn lock to lock while the trucks travelling would need some power, never mind when stationary, so I am looking for a servo with massive torque. A standard servo will give upto around 10kg of torque at a certain speed, dependent on its input voltage. Again servos can be bought in HV to gain higher torque. Larger servos in their physical size can also be found. So i needed a massive servo, HV as well? .... At first I ordered a giant scale high voltage servo rated at 120 kg of torque, the servo got bolted into a metal box which I welded to the chassis, and connected to the steering arm with another tie rod i bought from ebay as a spare part for another scooters steering assemble, i simply measured the length i needed and found one that was slightly longer, as i would either adjust its threads or cut to suit. Unfortunately what was needed to turn those wheels with all that weight above was yet more power, so a second was purchased. I did find it difficult to setup the servos to work in perfect tandem throughout their travel as they had to be mounted in different positions,. My RC transmitter is a computerised 10 channel TX with endless settings so I got it close mechanically and fine tuned it digitally !\nOnto lights yay...easy fun bit. loads n loads of 12v led lights. X2 Voltage regulators have been installed to drop the 24v down to the voltage required by the servos at 12v n lights at 12v.

It is an excellent product though! It will bond to concrete, brick, stone, mortar, wood, iron, steel and cured epoxy mortars. It is shrink free, insensitive to moisture during application, it has high tensile and flexural strength and is full of mold inhibitors. I live in Japan, so I bought a local brand, but you can easily find an epoxy mortar and grout with a quick Google search.\nThe epoxy grout is rubbed over the tiles. It is made from two different resins mixed with a filler making it is very waterproof and bettered suited to harsher cleaning products. This stuff sets super quickly too.\nThis step is tiling on the shelves\nOne shelf at a time:\nSmear the epoxy mortar onto a shelf and then place the tiles in it.

The LED strip doesn't bend well, so in the future, we might go a different direction for this type of setup, but it worked well enough! We also used hot glue periodically to hold down areas that didn't stick as well.\nThe Arduino (The \"Brain\")\nWe used an Arduino Micro for this to control the LEDs that light up the sign. There are lots of off the shelf LED controllers available but we enjoy coding it ourselves. It gives us more control and allows us to change things whenever we want, which is right up our alley! Along with the LEDs (300 sequential LEDs, all in a single strip), there\u2019s the Arduino Micro, a small breadboard, a 100uF capacitor, a 470ohm resistor, and a barrel jack for the 5V power source.\nPowering Everything\nThe Arduino uses a USB micro adapter for its power and the LEDs are powered externally by a separate 5V power adapter. Because there are 300 LEDs and they\u2019ll be using a lot of power, its recommended to power them separately and not through the Arduino. Since both the Arduino and the LEDs use a 5V power source, we could have spliced the one wall adapter to power them both\u2026but in our case, it was easier to just use two cords. We might upgrade it in the future to simplify once we\u2019re sure we\u2019ll stick with this configuration long-term.\n\nA Mini Breadboard?\nThe LED manufacturer recommends putting a 100-1000uF capacitor on the positive/negative terminals between the power input the LEDs to prevent any surges from damaging the LEDs, so we did that (100uF). Additionally, they recommend putting a 470ohm resistor between the data pin of the LEDs and the Arduino for the same reason, so we did that too. Since we didn\u2019t have a circuit board to solder these extra components to, we used the breadboard as a junction to get the capacitor and resistor in place. We also used it as a junction for the power and ground jumpers, since it was there.\n\nThe Code\nWe\u2019re using FastLED, which is an excellent free library available for Arduino that makes it super simple to make LEDs do\u2026basically whatever you want. You can choose which type of LEDs you\u2019re using and then use some really simple APIs to control them. Highly recommended if you\u2019ve not used it before! Otherwise, the code is dead simple! Choose your LED type, figure out how many there are, then tell them what to do.\nIf you'd like to see the actual code, check it out here: https://thewickedmakers.com/projects/how-to-make-a...\n\nTIP: If you don't want to do any of this, you can pick up off-the-shelf LED controllers which are just as awesome.

The one problem, which I'm sorting out in this instructable, is to lower the height of the tailstock centre. It's about 1mm higher that the headstock centre which is unacceptable for long turning and drilling. After a lot of thought and browsing the Internet for a solution, and finding nothing, I decided to try and skim the upper base of the tailstock myself. To do this I would need to hold the tailsock firmly on it's side on the cross slide and to use a fly cutter to do the skimming. As I don't own a fly cutter I had to make one.\nDesigns and videos for fly cutters are aplenty so I chose to use one of the simple ideas which I could turn on my lathe and then work out how to make the tool holder slots. I have sort-of followed the design in this drawing. I don't think the dimensions are critical.\nPay close attention, however, to the slot holding the cutting tool in place. The point of the cutter must lie along the centre line of the holder and it is crucial that you make the slot on the correct side of the centre line. If you study the images and drawing, and think of the direction of the spinning cutting tool you will see that, because of the angle of the cutting tool, it can only be on the one side.", "title": "Homemade Fly Cutter - From Scrap Steel", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Homemade-Fly-Cutter-From-Scrap-Steel/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I needed a bit of round bar about 30mm in diameter and I determined to find some scrap.

Again I remind you to be careful of which side of this line you will make your slot. You can cut it on the wrong side. It will depend on whether the 10 degree angle is towards you or away from you. Picture the cutting tool in action as it spins in the chuck. If you get this wrong the cutting point cannot line up with the scribed centre line across the face of the tool. I set the angle of the 10 degrees in my case with the tool pulled in towards me (see image) and clamped the tool post down - this must remain clamped until all the milling is complete. As we are using the quick change tool post to hold the work the work, together with the quick change tool post holder can be lifted out and replaced without the 10 degree angle being changed..\nUsing the set up I have and using an 8mm end mill you will need to set the top edge of the end mill to run along the scribed line.\nThe depth of the tool holder slot will be determined by the dimension of the cutting tool you will be using.

This milled cut of mine was about 10mm deep.\nNote: To keep chatter to a minimum I tightened up the lathe saddle plates and the gib slides on both the cross slide and the compound slide.

I used a scroll saw to round the ends of each hole but this can also be accomplished by sanding, using a jig saw, band saw, or even a wood chisel. By adding the curved ends and slightly opening the jig I can now fit a slightly larger dowel in the next downsized hole.\nFor example, if I were to take a 1\" dowel and put it in the 1\" hole in the jig it will freely turn as I drill it. But by moving the 1\" dowel down to the 3/4\" hole size I can squeeze the jig together and hold it with my hand or clamp it so that the dowel cannot turn when drilled.

The height was determined by dividing overall plies, as opposed to a specific measurement like 3/8\". There are/were 11 plies, so I cut through 5 of them on this first pass. The fence position was set and a stop block was clamped to the edge of the table at a distance of 12 1/2\" from the center of the bit [Fig. 1]. The second tier was cut with a 3/4\" straight bit - through the remaining 6 plies.\nNote: Don't move the fence or stop block, just change the bit and make the cut [Fig. 2].\n\nFor the bottom layer, I wanted something thin, but dense. The available 1/4\" plywood in my area is low quality, so my go to material is usually 3/16\" hardboard. I cut a piece a tad larger than necessary, spread glue on the bottom face of the plywood (the side with the 1\" slot), centered it on the hardboard, added another 3/4 board to help disperse pressure, and applied 104lbs of weight - shout out to Bowflex.\nNote: Be mindful with the glue near the center slot.

I started with the hole in the edge of my router table top because I wanted it vertically centered for strength. It's just a matter of setting the fence height, holding the tool firmly against the table edge, and making the plunge cut. Without making any adjustments to the machine, I made the same cut in the center of the 3/4\" strip. The domino was then glued into the 3/4\" strip.\n\nYou could do the same thing with a dowel peg. In that case, I would drill the hole through the 3/4\" strip using the drill press. I would then clamp it to the edge of the table (flush with the tabletop) and use it as a guide to drill the matching hole in the table.

A center hole was marked and drilled at 5/16\" diameter. Two side holes are drilled at 1/2\" diameter - 1\" in from each end [Fig. 1]. With the jig affixed to the router table using the front stop and retaining peg, this board was butted up to the back table edge, securely clamped, and used as a template to transfer hole locations [Fig. 2]. I drilled just deep enough to mark the center point, using a 5/16\" brad tip bit for the center hole and a 1/2\" forstner bit for the two side holes.\n\nThe actual holes were drilled using the drill press and forstner bits:\n3/8\" for the center hole so that the bolt wouldn't bind - drilled full depth (all the way through).\n3/4\" for the side holes, so the pegs wouldn't bind and get stuck - drilled around 1/2\" deep.\n\nTo elongate the 3/8\" hole into a slot, I used a 3/8\" straight bit on the router table - same fence settings that were used to cut the key way. I made a poor choice in cut direction, which resulted in one end of my slot being torn up. Instead of remaking the entire deck, I drilled out my mistake with a 1\" forstner bit and plugged the hole with a section of 1\" dowel [Fig. 4].

The bottom mark is used to drill a 7/8\" recess for a T-nut. The top mark is used to drill a hole for the 5/16\" countersunk bolts. I used a step bit for this hole, which worked magnificently.\n\nAt this point, I took the time to round the front end of the keys, so that they would slide all the way to tend of the rounded key way. I traced a socket and shaped the part using a 4\" disc sander. The T-nuts were hammered into place and then the bolts were shortened for a perfect fit, using an angle grinder for stock removal and the disc sander to remove burrs, as well as flatten the bottom of the bolt.\n\nPivot Pins\nThe pivot pin location is 1\" in from the front edge. A hole is then drilled for your pin material of choice. I made two versions since I'll be making discs for various projects and was indecisive.\n\nVersion 1: 1/8\" steel rod. I cut the rod with bolt cutters and deburred the edges with the strip sander. It was glued in place with a bit of epoxy.\n\nVersion 2: 5/8\" dowel. I cut the dowels to length using a small parts crosscut sled on the table saw. It was glued in place with wood glue.\n\nHow It Works\nAs you tighten the bolt, it bottoms out on the hardboard and presses the key upwards - lock in tightly and flush with the top of the deck.\n\nThe long keys actually work better since you can clamp them to the front edge of the table while tightening the bolt. The sort keys have a tendency to shift a bit.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXJ/UDOY/JR6OKE0O/FXJUDOYJR6OKE0O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLH/9Z13/JR6OKE1X/FLH9Z13JR6OKE1X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMN/KPVG/JR6OKE36/FMNKPVGJR6OKE36.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F13/LN2O/JR6OKE4K/F13LN2OJR6OKE4K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2T/6CKT/JR6OKE63/F2T6CKTJR6OKE63.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHV/HRM3/JR6OKE7C/FHVHRM3JR6OKE7C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMO/MZQL/JR6OKE7D/FMOMZQLJR6OKE7D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA2/9CG6/JR6OKE7F/FA29CG6JR6OKE7F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM9/98PR/JR6OKE7G/FM998PRJR6OKE7G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBJ/ON9D/JR6OKE7H/FBJON9DJR6OKE7H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX9/DT5Y/JR6OKE7I/FX9DT5YJR6OKE7I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5I/WTTK/JR6OKE7K/F5IWTTKJR6OKE7K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB5/GJRF/JR6OKE7M/FB5GJRFJR6OKE7M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU3/ZVJO/JR6OKE7R/FU3ZVJOJR6OKE7R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8M/OR5R/JR6OKE7W/F8MOR5RJR6OKE7W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLS/J9DA/JR6OKE7X/FLSJ9DAJR6OKE7X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDO/UGMZ/JR6OKE7Z/FDOUGMZJR6OKE7Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5R/EAPA/JRYUT84S/F5REAPAJRYUT84S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBT/Q3E8/JRYUT865/FBTQ3E8JRYUT865.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: The Pivot Pin Sliding Key"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "For the operation of cutting slots, I want a small sled, which will slide on the main deck like a rail.

The idea worked, just not very well. Even with magnets across the full width of the pouch it was only held very loosely.\nI took the metal out of the flap, and decided to see if I could fit the magnets in there. They fit, with some gentle persuasion, and held the flap closed much more securely. All I needed was a way to attach the magnets to the body of the pouch. A short length of paracord with the internal thread removed was the perfect way to attach them.\nTo stop the magnets moving inside the paracord I cut a small length of plastic tubing (from a cotton wool bud) to put between them (photos 3 & 4).

Slots are 2-1/4\" in from ends. Slots end 1/2\" from right side and 1\" from left side. These slots will allow for adjustment of the center foot. Cut the slots using your preferred method. I like to predrill the ends of the slots and use the router table to cut the remaining part. Setting up a fence on your drill press table really helps here. It is not critical that the slots are exactly 2-1/4\" from each end - but it is critical that the spacing of the slots and holes for the threaded inserts be the same. Leaving the drill press fence in place and using it for all of the holes aids in this.\nDo similar slots for the balance support upright.

The holes should be 2-1/4\" in from the ends (to match the distance between slots in last step) and centered on the width of the leg. For the 1/4\"-20 EZ-Loks listed, I find 11/32\" holes work well. If you use another brand of threaded insert, drill your holes to the size required. It may be a little fussy, but I like to counterbore the holes just a bit with a 1/2\" drill bit to allow the heads to sit flush, or slightly below, the surface. Go slow and steady so the drill doesn't grab and go too deep. Drill the same holes in the center of one side of the left leg (use your fence again). These will hold threaded inserts that allow the balance support foot to be adjusted.\nInsert 1/4\"-20 threaded inserts into these holes. I like to use a dab of general purpose glue like Elmer's ProBond Advanced to help secure the inserts over time. If you use a polyurethane glue like Gorilla Glue, use it very sparingly so that it doesn't expand over the top or into the threads.\nSand all the pieces as desired, but especially the surfaces that will be sliding against each other during adjustment.

A great example of one of these projects is to extract the hardware out of a cheap plastic screwdriver and turn it into a one-of-a-kind tool by crafting your own unique handle. This saves some cash relative to the screwdriver wood turning kits available online, and turning tool handles is a fun, straightforward beginner project that gives you something you can regularly use in your shop. These can also be quick projects to give away as gifts during the holidays, as a custom made tool will be much more appreciatively received than a pre-assembled tool purchased right off of the store shelf.\nSo I made a trip to my local big box hardware store and picked up a few Husky screwdrivers for about $3 a piece. These are the multi-bit models that have a long shank which holds a double-sided bit on each end and locks into a sort of collet within the screwdriver body itself.

I will be making four custom screwdriver handles with various materials that all have their own unique appearance, so the sky is the limit on your design and creativity. To get the blank ready for turning on the lathe, there are a few important steps that need to be taken, and some of these will be specific to the hardware you extracted from the cheap plastic screwdriver.\nFirst off, select the material that you wish to use for the handle. Tropical hardwoods are a great choice as they offer unique colors and grain patterns, but you want to make sure that you are using a wood with a medium to high density for a tool handle that will get heavy use. For my blanks, I'll be using a piece of padauk, a chunk of spalted beech, a piece of ash that I'll torrify with a blowtorch after turning, and a some fancy acrylic square stock.\nYou want to make sure that your blank is at least 6\" long (something closer to 8-10\" will give you more material to work with on the lathe, even if the final handle ends up being half of this length), and needs to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 2\" thick. When turning on the lathe, having a blank that is the same size in its width and thickness will save time and result in an easier cut with less chance of tear out. So I ripped all of my blanks to 6-8\" long and about 2\" square.\nNext, we need to square the two ends of the blank. This can be accomplished a variety of ways (miter saw, crosscutting on a table saw, disc sander) but having perfectly square and parallel ends is crucial in helping to mount the blank in the chuck and to drill a straight hole into the blank. After squaring the ends, we need to find the approximate center point on the two ends of the blank. On a square blank, simply use a straight edge to connect opposite corners of the ends, and the intersection of these lines will be your center point. If you're using a round blank, do your best to draw a few lines across the diameter of the ends and these approximate intersection points will be close to your center point. If you're using a particularly hard wood or an acrylic blank for your handle, now is a good time to round over the corners of your blank on the disc sander. This will reduce the likelihood of catastrophic tear out when you begin turning it into round on the lathe.\nIn order to mount the hardware inside the handle, we'll have to drill a couple of holes to accommodate the size of the hardware. This is a step that will vary depending on what sort of screwdriver hardware you acquired. For me, I have to drill two holes for each part of the hardware set: the collet, and the shank that holds the bits. Drilling these holes can be accomplished on a drill press, but I find the easiest method is to mount the blank in the lathe chuck and use a drill chuck in the tail stock to recess the holes (you must have perfectly square and parallel ends to use this method). This allows you to ensure that your mounting holes are in the exact same plane that your final piece will be turned to, guaranteeing that the screwdriver shank will be perfectly perpendicular to the finished handle.\nSo I first used a 5/8\" forstner bit to recess a 1 1/4\" deep hole, and then swapped this out for a 1/2\" drill bit and drilled this to 3 3/4\" deep. Again, these exact hole diameters and depths will likely change slightly depending on your hardware. Make sure that you test drill a hole for the collet on a piece of scrap wood. You want this fit to be tight but not excessively so - too loose and it will be tough for the adhesive to hold the hardware in place, but too tight and you'll be trying to hammer an epoxy covered collet into a hole on your finished handle.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIP/9UFW/JSUOTX6N/FIP9UFWJSUOTX6N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMZ/ONXT/JSUOTX7E/FMZONXTJSUOTX7E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSO/UVIG/JSUOTX7F/FSOUVIGJSUOTX7F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F44/LQPC/JSUOTX8L/F44LQPCJSUOTX8L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F92/HNXX/JSUOTXAR/F92HNXXJSUOTXAR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6U/BBA9/JSUOTXAT/F6UBBA9JSUOTXAT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Prepare Your Handle Blank"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Ferrules are an important part of wooden tool handles. Aside from offering a decorative element, these improve the strength of the handle and reduce the chance of the wood splitting if the tool is put into heavy use or dropped on the floor. While you can buy premade ferrules online, it's easy to make your own in only a few minutes.\nI find the best material for handle ferrules is copper pipe. Copper is easy to cut, doesn't require any special tools, and allows for several decorative options. I picked up a few 1\" wide, 2\" long copper couplings from the hardware store and these offered enough material to make several ferrules. I usually look to make my ferrules between 1/2' and 1\" long, depending on the look I'm going for. So once you've figured out the length you desire, place the copper piece in a vise and use a hacksaw to cut it to size. Begin by taking a few light passes on the copper tube to strike a line, and and then begin cutting down. Remember, hacksaws are designed to be a two-handed tool - using only one hand makes it difficult to get a straight, controlled cut. Only light pressure is needed to cut through the copper tube, so focus on keeping your cut as straight as possible.\nOnce the desired length of copper tube has been cut off, I like to take it to the disc sander to clean up and square the cut end. Copper is very thermally conductive, meaning that it can heat up very quickly. Use a pair of pliers to hold the ferrule while you press it into the disc sander. Very light touches will remove a good amount of material, and holding the copper against the abrasive cutting wheel for too long can produce so much heat that it can actually alter the color of the copper (more on that later...), so go at it easily until you're happy with the shape and finish. (NOTE: if you have a jagged edge even after hitting it on the disc sander, a deburring tool can quickly clean up the edge so that it's nice and smooth to the touch.)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Y/3ZNZ/JSUOTXFP/F1Y3ZNZJSUOTXFP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBW/YGOD/JSUOTXFQ/FBWYGODJSUOTXFQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOZ/XU4P/JSUOTXFR/FOZXU4PJSUOTXFR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Make the Ferrule"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "There are two solid options for how to turn your blanks on the lathe: turning between centers, or turning in a chuck. With a project this small, you will have no issues turning your blank between centers. To do this, take your spur center out of the lathe and place it on the center point on one end, hammering down with a dead blow mallet to seat the spurs (if you're paying attention to grain direction in your handle, the spur center side will be the butt end of your handle). After remounting this on the lathe, you can line up the live center on your tail stock and do your best to place this right in the center point of the hole that you drilled for the hardware. (NOTE: it can be difficult to seat the live center perfectly in the hardware hole, and if you're off by just a couple of millimeters you will end up turning a handle that is not perfectly perpendicular to the holes you drilled, which results in the screwdriver shank coming out of the handle at an angle. This is one of the reasons I prefer drilling and turning in the chuck). Since I elected to mount the blank in the chuck and recess my holes with a drill chuck, I swapped in the live center on the tail stock and after tightening down, I'm ready to roll.\nI'll be using carbide insert turning tools on this project, as they are a quick and easy way to rough out and detail small pieces on the lathe. I begin with a roughing tool to quickly turn the blank into round. I usually start initially at a slower speed (400-500 RPMs) to avoid getting too much tear out on the corners. Another option here is to remove the corners of the blank on the bandsaw, disc sander, or a hand plane to get the piece approximately round. One way to determine how round your blank is without turning the lathe off repeatedly is to lightly rest the arm of your cutting tool on top of the blank while it's spinning. A perfectly round blank will let the tool ride smoothly on the top of the piece, while something that isn't quite round yet will produce a lot of chatter. (NOTE: when turning acrylic blanks, you need to have the lathe speed turned up much higher - in the neighborhood of 2500 RPMs. Otherwise it can be very easily to get a ton of chip out.)\nOnce your blank is round, it's time to cut the tenon for your ferrule. While it's best to shoot for cutting a tenon that is the exact length of your ferrule, it's better to have a slightly longer tenon than a shorter one. You can always sand this down to size at the disc sander after assembly, if needed. Holding the ferrule so that it's lined up flush with the tail stock end of my blank, I use a pencil to scribe a small line where the end of the ferrule is. Then I place the pencil right on that line and manually turn the lathe spindle to transfer this mark to the entire blank. I use either digital calipers or a manual inside caliper to get the exact diameter of the inside of the ferrule, and then take this to the lathe.\nUsing a parting tool or square carbide insert cutter, I begin bringing the tenon down to size right up to the line I just drew. It's VERY easy to cut the tenon down too small, so stop to regularly check your tenon against the calipers. Once you're almost there (we're talking at most a millimeter larger than the inside diameter of the ferrule), stop there. Again, it's better to have an ever-so-slightly thicker tenon than one too thin.\nTurning the shape of the handle is all about feel. Having a handle that's too thick can make it difficult to grip properly, but too thin can mean that it wont feel beefy enough to put a lot of pressure into. Curves are always a nice detail to impart, but improperly placed ones will make the handle feel uncomfortable in your hand. I recommend taking a moment to grab some small hand tools sitting around your shop (other screwdrivers, chisels, handsaws, etc) and see which ones feel the most comfortable in both their size and shape.\nOne of the great things about turning is that you don't really know what the final shape of your handle will be until you start cutting. The finished piece is hiding somewhere inside that chunk of wood. It's up to you to find it. Using your preferred cutting tool, remove material slowly and consider both the aesthetic and tactile shape as you turn your curves.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBT/RRGP/JSUOUBOT/FBTRRGPJSUOUBOT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Initial Turning"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "As you approach your finished shape, you want to determine how long the handle will end up being. Stop the lathe as you come to a shape you like, and grip the piece on the lathe. Make sure that you're pleased with the feel and comfort of the handle, and determine where you would like the butt of the handle to be. I find that I like my handles to extend around a half of an inch past where my palm grips it. Use a pencil to strike a line while manually spinning the spindle to encircle the blank with this mark. Using a parting tool, bring down the diameter of the waste wood behind this mark to a small cylinder - something less than an inch. A round carbide cutter is great for removing material on both sides of this area, rounding over the butt of the handle as much as possible.\nWith your handle shaped and approximately brought down to length, ramp up the speed of your lathe and use a scraper or square radius cutting tool to shear off material very slightly, trying to make one pass across the length of the handle. This should give you a very fine surface free of tool marks and small imperfections. Now it's time to grab your 100 grit cutting tool (aka sandpaper) and begin easing the surface to a super smooth finish. I like to use a scotch brite pad with sandpaper wrapped around it to sand my pieces progressively through the grits. This gives you a cushion to press into your piece while preventing your fingers from getting too hot through the sandpaper. Work through the grits quickly (100/150/180/220/320) and flip between forward and reverse mode (if your lathe has this) to make sure that the grain is evenly removed in both directions. One consideration toward the end of this process is what sort of finish you're going to be using. If you prefer water-based finishes, it's important to lightly wet the piece before you sand at 180-220 grit to raise the grain. Not doing so will result in a rough-feeling surface once you've applied your finish. This isn't as much of a consideration when using oil-based finishes.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKT/YVZ2/JSUOTXK9/FKTYVZ2JSUOTXK9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F28/HJXI/JSUOTX6J/F28HJXIJSUOTX6J.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Final Turning and Sanding"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "With the turning and sanding steps done, you can now remove the piece from the lathe. You will likely have a candlestick-looking piece similar to the one above. In order to release the waste wood from the butt end of handle, use a bandsaw or handsaw to carefully cut away the little spindle on the bottom of the handle. You now have a rough unfinished butt end that needs to be addressed. I like to use a disc sander to very lightly shape the butt into a round surface that follows the bottom contours of the handle. Then, using the same grits that you did on the lathe, hand sand this surface going gradually higher up onto the handle at each grit. The finished product should be evenly smooth and feel great in your hand throughout the length of the piece.\nIn order to prep the handle for finish, take a shop towel or rag lightly wet with mineral spirits and rub the handle down. This will remove any surface dust from the sanding process, and will give you a chance to examine the surface to ensure that there are no unseemly tool or sanding marks that you may have overlooked previously. Address any if needed.\nFor finish, you have a TON of options. Do you want to feel the wood grain in the final piece, or have a super smooth, hardened surface that looks like glass? Do you prefer a satin finish, or something glossier and shiny? How much protection do you want the handle to have, as opposed to having a finish that's easily repairable? My go-to finish for almost all things woodworking is Arm-R-Seal from General Finishes. It really highlights the color of the wood, serves as a highly protective and highly glossy film, is easy to apply and feels great to the touch. But your options include lacquer, natural oils (danish, walnut or tung oils), an oil/wax mixture, or even CA glue if you want to finish your handle super quickly. Regardless of your desired choice, do your best to avoid getting any finish on the outer diameter of the tenon or the inside of your hardware hole. This will make it more difficult to install your hardware. For a tool that will get handled quite a bit, it's a good idea to do at least three coats of your desired finish to give it as much protection as possible, sanding lightly with 400-600 grit sandpaper in between coats.\nLastly, you need to decide what (if anything) to do with your copper ferrule. A natural, untouched copper ferrule can go great with your handle, but there are a few options you can explore to give your ferrule a more artistic look. In the examples that I've made for this Instructable, I created three distinctly different ferrules to help you see what some options look like (the acrylic handle didn't receive a ferrule). For my padauk handle, I left the copper unfinished, which produces a very clean and sleek appearance that matches the tropical hardwood. For my spalted beech handle, I used a flat black spray-on paint/primer that helps attract the eye to the dark spalting lines in the wood. And for the torrified ash handle, I used a blow torch to heat the copper to a high temperature, resulting in a striking mixture of color. These are only a few options you can choose from, but you can see that there are many directions you can go that help to highlight and compliment the appearance of your handle.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FKE/8O2I/JSUOU6A7/FKE8O2IJSUOU6A7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMJ/ZMY5/JSUOTXK1/FMJZMY5JSUOTXK1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5G/IA6C/JSUOTXKD/F5GIA6CJSUOTXKD.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Final Shaping and Finish"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Now that you have a beautiful and functional wooden handle all finished, it seems like the perfect time to goop it up with a bunch of epoxy! I dread this step because it's so easy to mess up a piece that has taken a lot of time to create, but with some careful attention to detail, this step is pretty straight forward. First, lets talk about adhesives. My go-to adhesive for almost every project is epoxy, as it is void filling and will never come off... But you can use CA glue (aka super glue) if you don't have epoxy sitting around - this process can just be a little messier and doesn't give you as much working time to get everything perfect.\nFor both pieces of hardware, it's important to scuff up the face that will be glued to the handle with sandpaper to give a better surface for your adhesive to bond to. Prep your epoxy or CA glue and have some wet shop towels on hand. I began with the collet so that I could leave it in place while attaching the ferrule. Based on the diameter hole I drilled to insert this, it's pretty friction fit and doesn't need much epoxy. After spreading a small amount of epoxy on the interior edge of the hardware hole, I slid in the collet and pressed it against my workbench to ensure that it's perfectly flat with the end of the handle.\nFor the ferrule, it's important not to apply any epoxy to the area that's between 1/8\"-1/4\" from the handle end of the tenon. This will help avoid having to deal with any squeeze out on the handle end. Slide the ferrule onto the tenon, rotating it to spread the adhesive around evenly. Once it's fully seated, now is the time to wipe away any squeeze out with your wet shop towel. Find a way to hold your handle upright while this dries.

It has sat in my lumber stacks for the past 6 months until I had the time/motivation/inspiration to do something with it. Currently I don't have a really good place in my house to do work for my full time job.

I figured this was the best place to put a desk to do work at. I originally thought about a desk with three \"sides\", matching the bay window. However, I soured on that idea after awhile and decided to go with just one angle. For the base I wanted to try to make a \"floating\" system. The idea here is that from most common viewing angles (i.e. typical human height) you can't see that the desk top is resting on the base. Only if you get underneath will you be able to tell.

But then I found the advantage that came with being able to remove the router from its fixed location to a handheld unit. It meant, among other things, that I could use the wider router base as leverage.\nWith this instructable, I want to expand its usage. But let's take it's highly simple, maneuverability nature with us as we do it. Or why do it. Right?\nThese days there are a lot of people making resin tables with uneven surfaces. They're using logs, slabs and even sticks as the main body before they pour. I'm all for resin and all of its sticky properties, but unless those brave epoxy warriors are planning on doing a complete resin cover as it levels itself, there needs to be a way to level the wood. There also needs to be a way to level it as well, after all it set and cured.\nEnter Router Rails.\nNo, no, this isn't some high speed track where routers rush down train tracks, speeding on bearings.

No, need to be flat. Let's keep that in the forefront of our craniums. Buy shelfing rails that are flat and strong. With the \"U\" style shelf rails that I used, there's a lot of reinforced strength that should keep things straight, that is, of course, unless you choose narrow rails (or have a massive Triton router with the 3 1/4 hp motor. If that's the case, go industrial strength). Make sure of this when buying rails. I went with rails that had a 7/8\" section between the top and bottom of the \"U\". If yours is less, I cannot guarantee it will come out the same.\nLet's put this another way, if you choose a different size, godspeed young grasshopper. Throw a comment at the bottom of this and tell us all what you did differently. You'll have to use this instructable as more of a general guide as the sizes will be different. And, in this case, size does matter. We'll need to make absolutely sure that when the base is pressed into the rails that there is a snug fit; NOT a hammer-it-in-with-a-sledgehammer fit, but a nice, solid fit that you can do with your hands. The reason for this is simple: if you wedge it tight in the channel, you're taking a chance that deformation could occur. The bottom lip is not hardened steel and can deform with large amounts of pressure.\nSo, yeah, find a ruler and measure the inside area if you want this to be absolutely perfect. If you can't find the inside dimensions to be of that size, adjust the overall width (the part that fits into the brackets) to what will work.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMZ/QI0Q/JSPABHXX/FMZQI0QJSPABHXX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: A Few Cautionary Words on Selecting Rails"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Okay, no fancy words. This is the base. Not bass (fishy or instrumental), but base. It is quite literally the heart of this project. This means that we'll need to put a little time in making it to ensure that everything works in tandem. The rails are the arms that connect to the...well, heart. Maybe metaphors aren't my thing. We'll see.\nI've put the exact specs that I used with a 7/8\" inside diameter rail in a handy sketchup image attached to this step, so pour over it and soak it in. This will definitely be different (and maybe the only thing different) if you either can't find a 7/8\" ID rail or go larger. Again, I don't recommend going smaller, so proceed at your own risk.\nWe'll need to use a 1/2\" thick piece of plywood that will be the exact same size (not thickness, just width and length) as our 9\" x 9\" acrylic sheet that's attached to our router. Connected to that will be 4 pieces of wood. A top and bottom piece measuring 9\" x 1 1/2\" x 3/4\", and two side pieces (those that will fit in the rail) that measure 12\" x 7/8\" x 5/8\".\nWe'll also want to cut out a viewing hole out of the center that will also allow our router bit to pass through, as well as, well, being able to view what's below. You could get riskier and cut a larger diameter hole out so more viewing can be observed, but that is something you'll have to decide on your own as I have no idea how well it'll work. These are uncharted waters so boldly do as you must in safety.\nTo make the hole, make diagonals from one corner to the other on adjacent corners. This will form an 'X' in the middle. Simple enough. Use your compass and measure out a radius of 2\", set your needle point in the center and sketch out your 4\" centered circle. Next, cut out the circle.

Those dimensions are in the last step. I clamped it all together and added weight to make sure nothing moved during the drying stage.\nI used my Super easy spline jig to add splines to all 4 corners.\nGluing the base...and beyond!\nNow let's have a discussion about gluing our base together. I glued all my joints with the weakest joint possible, edge to edge. Is it enough strength for our router base? I have no idea, honestly. Titebond II glue proclaims to be stronger than wood when glued, but I have never done a comparison to see how strong it really is. There are a few options here. You could use my Super Easy Spline Jig, but that means a deep cut to get to the plywood center of the tootsie pop, which it will do easily. If you don't have my spline jig, there may be other spline jigs out there that will allow you the same thing.\nYou could also use biscuit joints to connect the pieces as well as dowel rods if you have a dowel rod jig. I can't recommend using screws as plywood is not meant to be screwed into the thickness, but it may work somewhat well if you used an appropriate pilot hole.\nTo recap: I used edge gluing when I glued all 4 pieces of wood (the sizes being in the last step) to my piece of plywood; but I used splines on all 4 corners to reinforce the wood. Gluing may be enough, but that is not what I did. I do not believe there is any danger in gluing alone (especially by the manufacturers description (and let's limit this to titebond II)) except for a damaged project if things head south.\nAfter it's been glued and allowed to cure, I used a belt sander to clean the edges.\nFinalizing the edges", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAJ/VWR0/JSOZ3DBB/FAJVWR0JSOZ3DBB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAV/0PUN/JSOZ3DB9/FAV0PUNJSOZ3DB9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG4/NX0O/JSOZ3DBE/FG4NX0OJSOZ3DBE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ4/L7ZM/JSOZ3DBF/FZ4L7ZMJSOZ3DBF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8V/PIS6/JSOZ3DBI/F8VPIS6JSOZ3DBI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBX/SOO3/JSOZ3DBK/FBXSOO3JSOZ3DBK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Edge Gluing and Beyond"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Now we'll cut out the rail ties (do you get the play on words here?). The nice thing about these shelf rails is that there are screw holes every 11 1/4\" inches. Can you guess how far apart we'll put the rail ties? Yes, 11 1/4\" inches apart. We'll cut 6 rail ties at 10 1/4\" out of the 7/8\" square dowel rods. These ties will be placed one by one inside the rail at each of the 6 screw holes. Yes, there are 7 screw holes in these rails, but the center one will be for the base, so we'll leave that one alone.\nWith the rail facing up in the air (the bottom of the 'U' facing up), we'll slide the dowels in from underneath until all have been inserted, again lining them up under the screw holes.\nOKAY, hopefully that wasn't too much to bite off. When in doubt, watch the video. By the way, clicking on the links in each of these steps will take you directly to the exact place where the step being described is being performed.\nNow we'll drill 1/8\" pilot holes in each of the 6 ties ends (through the screw holes) before putting a #10 x 1\" wood screw in each hole. We'll then insert the base (again, not squeezed in so tight that it deforms the metal. You should be able to lightly press it in). Find the center of the base and match it up with the center of the rails, the 7th hole, which conveniently is the most center hole.\nBe careful or you'll do what I did when drilling a hole in the base through the screw holes: I underestimated the width of the wood. Drill a 1/2\" deep pilot hole with the 1/8\" drill bit and put a #10 x 1/2 wood screw through the rail and into the base.\nOnce this screw is in we'll flip the rail down on the bench so that the 6 square dowel rods are in the upright, vertical position as well as the base.

The toggle bolt will need to lock in place after it hits the plastic base of the router, so test where that spot sweet spot should be. Squeeze the lever down until it locks in place, then tighten the set bolts that came with the clamp so that it doesn't move. Of course, a little threadlock would work great here or even some locking nuts, but so far I haven't needed to use anything other than what came with the toggle bots.\nToggle it, just a little bit...\nCenter your handles on the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 6th ties, drill your pilots with your 1/8\" bit and put in (8) #10 x 1/2\" combo pan head screws (dome top, flat underside).

Well, kinda. This instructable assumes you have a 9\" x 9\" x 3/16\" piece of acrylic attached to your router. But that's not fair. Why? Because who has a 9\" x 9\" x 3/16\" piece of acrylic attached to their router? Okay, I see a few hands up in the back, but I want this to be universal. I want this very clever way of flattening a surface to be available to anyone and everyone interested.\nAs each and every router is different, I cannot be more than slightly helpful for this step. Your router should have a base on it already. The best thing that you can do is find the center of a piece of 9\" x 9\" x 3/16\" acrylic, draw a line from corner to corner. Now you'll have an \"X\" in the center. If you take the base off your old router, you can center up the \"X\" through the hole in the center of the old router base. You'll find the screw holes that attached the old base and mark them on the acrylic.\nThis is where it gets tricky. The screw holes need to be sloped as your old screws were recessed in the plastic. You'll have to mimic how your old router base was attached. This will include making pilot holes. Again, each and every router is different, so it wouldn't be fair of me to try to list every router screw for every router. Besides, that would be cruel to me, and I've been nothing but nice to you...haven't I?\nOnce you've rigged up your acrylic to your router, you'll need to plunge a hole through the plastic...very carefuly. Acrylic is very strong, but it gets picky when it is cut or drilled in to. You'll need to find a good bit, preferably one that you'll use with your Router on Rails, and slowly lower your router into the plastic. Of course, for this method you'll need to have a plunge router. If you don't have one of these, carefully use a forestner bit and drill out the appropriate sized hole in the direct center of the \"X\".", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9J/WSXP/JSPAE0PT/F9JWSXPJSPAE0PT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3O/YRI1/JSPAE0PU/F3OYRI1JSPAE0PU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Installing a Platform to Your Router"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Okay, another step that's not entirely part of this project, but necessary to make the project work. To flatten a tabletop or a log, or whatever it is that needs flattenin', I recommend using a bowl router bit. Stay far away from the 1/4\" diameter shaft as you'll be using every bit of the...bit to route with. My router bit is a bowl bit with a 1/2\" shank on it that's about 1 1/4\" wide. It's made by Freud and is an excellent tool that I have used many times for projects like this.\nHere's a few tips for you.\nNever let your router sit in one spot for too long as it is on or you will burn the wood below the router bit.\nEase into the material. Don't jam the bit into the wood or start with the bit touching the wood that's about to be removed.\nTake breaks. The bit gets very hot. Tighten the collet as you go. It'll loosen as it gets hot which will damage your work.\nNever use a dull bit, it will run on the wood instead of cutting it and can be dangerous.\nYou will need runners on either side of the wood you plan on cutting flat. As each set up is a little different, do a little research on how to add runners next to your project. As the Router Rails is something I concocted for a project many years ago, I don't know how widely used it is. I do know that router sleds are popular. Runners for those should be easy to find and make. These runners are important as they create a flattening plane that you'll want to match your router to.\nThe runners you use MUST be longer than the project you plan on cutting as the router bit will need to come to the edge of your project. Remember that the edge of your project still needs to have proper runner space for the 5 1/8\" half of your Router Rails.\nMake small passes. Don't try to cut too much at one time.\nI do have plans for making runners in the future (something I think is unique), but a pair of 4x4's should work just fine, so long as you plan everything out.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVH/IEC1/JSPAE0TA/FVHIEC1JSPAE0TA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEJ/P8P7/JSPAE3Z4/FEJP8P7JSPAE3Z4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZY/1188/JSPAE40K/FZY1188JSPAE40K.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Type of Bit to Use and General Operation"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Thank you for giving this page a look.

You tape the front edge down of the game board and students slide a penny across the table trying to land on the images.

I had mentioned I like woodworking to the boxing coach one day and he asked me if I could make a rack to hold all of the medicine balls the gym has. Currently they occupy a corner of the mats and it would be good to get it a little more organized. I thought this would be a fun little challenge so I happily agreed.\nThe Design:\nI first identified where in the gym the coaches would want the rack to be located. This helped me to identify the physical constraints I was working with. I had about a 4.5 foot wide area to work with. I decided to make a three level rack that was 4 feet wide and about 4 feet tall. I hadn't decided on the width at the time but it ended up being around 9 inches deep.\nMaterials:\nA spare 2\" x 6\" x 10' I had lying around.\nAn 8' 4\" x 6\" pine beam I got for free off of craigslist.\n6 foot long 1\" diameter oak dowel\n\nTools:\nTable Saw\nChop Saw\nRouter\nRound Over Bit (Whiteside is a great brand for router bits)\nDrill/Drill Press\nForstner Bit (1\" Diameter)\nClamps\nWood Glue (I used titebond III)\nSome Screws\nStain of your choice, I used Minwax Red Elm and Minwax Ebony\nOrbital Sander w/ Sandpaper", "title": "Medicine Ball Rack", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Medicine-Ball-Rack/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I was kind of making up this project as I went along. The first thing I decided to do was cut the horizontal rails. I needed 6, 2 for each level.\n- First cut the 10 foot beam down into more manageable sections on the chop saw. I cut mine to 4 foot sections.\n- If you want to clean up the edges on a jointer, more power to you. Otherwise, you can trim the sides with your table saw. I choose to do both. I did one pass through the jointer to take of a 16th and get a nice edge to work with. Then I ran them down the table saw and trimmed the 2\" x 6\" down until it was just a hair over 4\" across.\n- Now rip these sections down the middle. If you have done it right and taken the table saw kerf into account, you should have two pieces that are each 2\" across.\n- I didn't touch the other dimension of the pieces as I wanted these to be as solid as possible. This left me with 6 sticks that were each 2\" x 1.5\" x 48\".\n- This is optional but I choose to take my router and a 1/2\" round over bit and take off one edge. This will eventually be the part of the rail making contact with the medicine ball.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSD/V6O8/JSOZ3FLG/FSDV6O8JSOZ3FLG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTB/D8AP/JSOZ3FM6/FTBD8APJSOZ3FM6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: The Horizontal Rails"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I decided to use the big pine 4\" x 6\" to make the vertical legs.\n- First, I cut the 8 foot beam down so I had a 4.5' section.\n- Now, take the beam and rip it in half on your table saw. Luckily I have a giant old table saw that can take a 14\" blade, this made ripping the beam down pretty easy. I choose to rip it across the shorter side. This left me with two pieces each ~2\" x 6\".\nI decided the best way to mount the horizontal rails was to cut recesses or pockets into the vertical legs for them to sit into. I could glue these into place as well as put a screw in them to keep things strong.\nMark out the spacing you want between the different rack levels on the pieces you just cut. This is kind of up to you depending upon how big of medicine balls you are working with and your dimensions.\nWith the spacing marked, go and mark out on the short sides the exact locations you want to put the horizontal rails. Now you need to cut out the material from the vertical leg to create the pocket. You can do this using a table saw and cross cut fence or just using a hand saw and chisels. I choose to use the table saw just because it was faster and I didn't want to make a particular emphasis of this piece being crafted with hand tools.\nCut these pockets out of both sides (see the picture if this is confusing).\nNow for the fun twist. To get the medicine ball to sit securely on the rail, there needs to be some minimum distance between them. I had originally planned to just put the rails into each side of the vertical legs and calling it done. However, I started having nightmares about the rack not being stable. Therefore, I decided to split the two pieces I had just made and space them apart using dowels.\nPretty straightforward, just set your fence accordingly and rip the two vertical legs in half, right down the middle.\nWe are 90% of the way there.\nLast thing to do is drill hols for the dowels. I choose to put 4 in each side, splitting the gaps between each of the horizontal rails. You can do this with the appropriate size drill bit and a hand drill or drill press.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6P/AUN4/JSOZ3FMB/F6PAUN4JSOZ3FMB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F32/EYVG/JSOZ3FMK/F32EYVGJSOZ3FMK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI7/UQUT/JSOZ3FMI/FI7UQUTJSOZ3FMI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Vertical Legs"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I say to do the finishing now, before assembly, because it will be far easier to sand and stain everything while it is in pieces.\nThe bare pine is kind of boring, in my opinion, so I stained the vertical rails a dark ebony and the horizontal rails a red elm. The oak dowels I didn't stain.\nBy the way, cut the dowels down to the appropriate length to get your rack to have the desired width. In my case I cut them at 6 inches. 1/2 inch on each side would be pressed into the holes that we drilled. That would make my interior gap approximately 5 inches.\nTo recap, sand -> stain\nOnce everything cures/sets you can go for final assembly.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 3: Finishing"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Time to put this things together and go get a workout in.\nFirst you need to assemble the horizontal rails onto the vertical legs.

Get the dowels aligned and use hand clamps to slowly press everything together. Clean up any glue that was running and then let it set.\nCome back the next day and do any touch up/clean up that you feel is necessary.\nAnd you're in business!

By using 3/4'' electrical conduit for your main support you are able to insert 1/2'' electrical conduit into the 3/4'' pipe to extend on the outside ,creating even more storage.\nBy cutting plywood that fits in between your upright 2'' x 4'' and placing it on the conduit you can incorporate shelving into your rack, or make just a rack to be a shelving unit.\nThe rack in the picture is 12'- 0'' high 30'' wide with a pipe spacing of 16'' the individual ladders are spaced 3' -0'' apart.\nMaterial : 2'' x 4'' , 3/4'' and 1/2'' electrical conduit ( comes in 10'-0'' lengths), plywood for shelves.\n( 1 ) Once you have laid out how big and how many uprights you require, lay out your hole spacing.

One of the primary motivations for this project was to try a wireless charging receiver in conjunction with a battery in an LED light. I've seen a lot of people add wireless charging transmitters to anything and everything, but haven't seen wireless charging receivers used in many projects, so I wanted to try one out.\nThis is entered in the REMIX CONTEST -- if you enjoy it, I'd greatly appreciate your vote :) https://www.instructables.com/contest/remix2019/\nMake sure to check out the YouTube video at the top of this instructable, since often the video demonstration is helpful in understanding the instructions here.\nSince it has the wireless charging receiver, you can charge it with any Qi wireless charger (like those used for Androids and iPhones), or make your own custom wireless charging base to really take it up a notch. All the electronics are off the shelf parts from Amazon, including the music reactive sp106e LED controller. This controller is pretty darn cool. It does solid colors, patterns, and even has a built in microphone for music syncing. Music controllers I've tried in the past have always been too blinky/flashy - like an out of control strobe light. As a result, I've often gone through the tedious Arduino programming to create my own music controllers. But, this one has much improved music reactive programming, smoothly blending in and out of patterns, instead of using binary on/off programming.\nAs for the aesthetic design, the shape of the lamp was inspired by several other cube lamps I've seen, and particularly by Darbin Orvar's fantastic concrete light cube: https://www.instructables.com/id/Concrete-LED-Ligh...", "title": "Wirelessly-Charged Epoxy LED Cube Lamp", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Wirelessly-Charged-Epoxy-LED-Cube-Lamp/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "\u00b7 Melamine shelving \u2013 buy at local big box store\n\u00b7 black caulk\n\u00b7 Heat Gun: https://amzn.to/2seaErS\n\u00b7 Total Boat Epoxy Resin: https://amzn.to/2RFzYRS\n\u00b7 5V LED Strip: https://amzn.to/2Emga2h\n\u00b7 5V music sync LED controller: https://amzn.to/2PArObU\n\u00b7 LiPo Battery: https://amzn.to/2DVfFKZ\n\u00b7 Wireless Charging Receiver: https://amzn.to/2NeXBQp\n\u00b7 Wireless Charging Pad / Transmitter: https://amzn.to/2VaRZJH\n\u00b7 Battery Charging Protection Board: https://amzn.to/2BKdJF3\n\u00b7 Aluminum Foil Tape: https://amzn.to/2L36CK5\n\u00b7 Epoxy/Plastic Polish: https://amzn.to/2sljlQm\n\u00b7 Fine grit sandpaper (to 2000 grit): https://amzn.to/2smxPPW\n\u00b7 Cordless Drill & Driver: https://amzn.to/2F9y0b5\n\u00b7 world\u2019s Greatest Sander: https://amzn.to/2PLUJOB", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRT/0QZN/JSL37G3Y/FRT0QZNJSL37G3Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJK/8W8D/JSL37G44/FJK8W8DJSL37G44.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9V/SFA7/JSL37GTC/F9VSFA7JSL37GTC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: PARTS LIST"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The main form is cut from \u00be\u201d melamine, and has four sides with mitered joints and a base \u2013 pretty simple.

Slow hardener also helps pour thicker, by slowing the curing reaction (and thus reducing the heat produced by the reaction).\nFor each layer of epoxy, mix at a 2:1 ratio of epoxy to hardener. I recommend using paint cups so you can just pour straight into the cup. Then add 6 or 7 drops of black epoxy pigment. This is the pigment I used: https://amzn.to/2Ss1KkY\nLet the resin cure for 1.5 \u2013 2 hours, mix the next layer, and repeat until the form is full.

If they aren\u2019t two bad, you might be able to get away with using a disc sander and/or orbital sander. However, I found it easier to run all sides through the table saw to square them up. I would make 2-3 passes to cut up to the max height of the blade on a given side, then flip the cube over and make 2-3 passes to finish cutting off the other half of the same side. Then I repeated this for all four sides of the cube to square up the sides. Making multiple passes through the table saw allows you to push the cube through the saw more quickly, so that heat doesn\u2019t build up (which runs the risk of softening the epoxy and cutting unevenly).\nAfter squaring the sides at the table saw, it is time to carve out the cavity for the electronics. I used a forstner bit and router on the router table to carve this cavity in the bottom. However, I\u2019m not going to go into more detail on this step, since I would actually recommend using foam (e.g., pink insulating foam) to create an insert in the form when you pour. Pouring over a foam insert will provide a cavity in the cube right out of the form, so you don\u2019t have to waste epoxy by carving out the cavity later.\nAfter the cavity is created, use a 5/8\u201d forstner bit to create a tunnel for the wiring between the LEDs in the channel and the other electronics in the cavity. You\u2019ll drill from the channel to the middle of the cube, and then up from the middle of the cavity until you meet the first hole you drilled. The result is a sort of upside-down chimney between the cavity and the channel.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPP/1OSR/JSL37DN7/FPP1OSRJSL37DN7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI9/N0E9/JSL37DO7/FI9N0E9JSL37DO7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQK/9ZIR/JSL37EKH/FQK9ZIRJSL37EKH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPZ/HDH9/JSL37EJW/FPZHDH9JSL37EJW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMW/A5QM/JSL37EIR/FMWA5QMJSL37EIR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNK/KOJT/JSL37EHS/FNKKOJTJSL37EHS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F69/YTLJ/JSL37EHK/F69YTLJJSL37EHK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVL/2ZFE/JSL37G3S/FVL2ZFEJSL37G3S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRT/6LB5/JSL37G3L/FRT6LB5JSL37G3L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5W/EM2K/JSL37G3F/F5WEM2KJSL37G3F.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Rough Shaping the Cube"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "You\u2019ll want to wire up the electronics now and test the LED strips, before you cover them in epoxy, since they\u2019ll be in the cube permanently once cover them in white epoxy.\nHere are the electronic parts:\n- TP4056 charging protection board: https://amzn.to/2BKdJF3\n- pigtail power jacks: https://amzn.to/2tC9wyA\n- individually addressable 5V LED Strip: https://amzn.to/2Emga2h\n- SP106e 5V music sync LED controller: https://amzn.to/2PArObU\n- LiPo Battery: https://amzn.to/2DVfFKZ\n- Wireless Charging Receiver: https://amzn.to/2NeXBQp\n- Wireless Charging Pad / Transmitter (optional): https://amzn.to/2VaRZJH\n- 3-pin JST connectors: https://amzn.to/2Xo3xLq\n(1) Cut off the JST on the power/ground wires on the LiPo battery, and solder these wires to the Battery +/- terminals on the TP4056 board.\n(2) Connect the micro usb cable from the wireless charging receiver to the micro USB jack on the TP4056 board.\n(3) Solder the +/- output terminals on the TP4056 charging protection board to the +/- wires on a male pigtail power jack, then plug the power jack into the SP106e LED controller.\n(4) Cut a length of LED strip so that it wraps around all four sides of the channel in the cube.

It allows the woodworker to make things as simple as picture frames, or as complex as custom cabinetry, with simple straight cuts. Jigs for making pocket holes range from super simple to production-class machines. Price, naturally, increases with capability. For the casual woodworker, the modestly-priced jigs can be used to build almost anything the bigger units can - it just requires more manual setup and, therefore, time.\nThis plan will show how to build a more capable pocket hole workstation using one of the basic jigs and some simple woodworking. The workstation is portable, easy to build, and can make the drilling of accurate pocket holes quick and easy. The focus is on making a capable tool at a relatively low cost.

If you are willing to go without the dust collection port, a much simpler jig holder has been added as Step 4.\nThe heart of the work station is a \"pinch box\" that securely holds the jig. It must also allow easy adjustment of the jig to allow holes to be made in materials of different thicknesses. The jig fits into some shallow reliefs that keep the jig from being pushed backwards.\nFor whatever reason, the jig is made with a shallow 2-1/2 degree angle on the sides. The trickiest part of this whole project is getting the reliefs cut at that angle. Note: If you are comfortable sanding the sides of the jig flat, fitting this angle can be avoided. A disc or belt sander with a well-adjusted table would be ideal for this.\nFor this Instructable, I'll make the angled parts. Start with plywood (I use baltic birch for this one) 2-1/4\" wide that is thicker than the jig. Mine was not, so I glued two pieces together. Set the blade at a 2-1/2 degree and cut each end for the entire thickness. Use the jig to set the blade height on the table saw for the relief. I used a crosscut guide with a stop block to cut the relief approximately 1/16\" deep on each end. Next, cut the angled ends off 1/2\" from the relief. This gives you the two \"pinch blocks\".\nCut two pieces of plywood 3-1/4\" wide and 4-1/2\" long for the sides of the box. Place the pinch blocks on either side of the jig and measure the width (mine was 2-1/8\" as shown in the picture). Cut another piece of plywood 3-1/4\" wide and the length equal to your measurement in the last step for the back of the box.\nGlue the pinch blocks flush with the ends of the sides and insert the back on the opposite ends. Clamp as in the picture. I fastened the back in place with brad nails. Once the glue is dry, drill a hole in the center of each of the sides for a 1/4\" carriage bolt. Drill one side 1/4\" and the other side a bit larger. A 3-1/2\" carriage bolt is used to tighten the sides together to pinch the jig. Use a nut and washer to hold the carriage bolt in the side with the 1/4\" hole as in picture. A 1/4\"-20 star knob is used to tighten the pinch box onto the jig.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F86/1UZW/JSIUN7C7/F861UZWJSIUN7C7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJG/ZIVV/JSEZ5IL3/FJGZIVVJSEZ5IL3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6T/UUV5/JSEZ5KLH/F6TUUV5JSEZ5KLH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FME/RIBQ/JSEZ5KLD/FMERIBQJSEZ5KLD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAH/7QAN/JSEZ5IJ7/FAH7QANJSEZ5IJ7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVZ/7COI/JSEZ5O7B/FVZ7COIJSEZ5O7B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQR/LSG3/JSEZ2ZY6/FQRLSG3JSEZ2ZY6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8U/Z2XL/JSEZ5KIW/F8UZ2XLJSEZ5KIW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Jig Holder"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Note: some of the pictures in this step are from an earlier version and may appear a little different than the current one.\nThe rest of the work station is fairly straightforward. The base can be made from whatever you have on hand. I glued two pieces of 1/2\" plywood together, but 3/4\" plywood would work well also. For this example, the base is 12\" wide and 36\" long.\nThe jig is moved higher or lower in the pinch box to drill holes in different thicknesses of wood. For 1/2\", the bottom of the jig needs to extend below the bottom of the pinch box. A 1-1/4\" clearance hole is drilled in the base to allow this. In my case, I drilled the hole through just one piece of the 1/2\" plywood before gluing them together.\nPosition the box with the back flush with the back edge of the base and clamp in place. Drill holes for screws to firmly fix the box to the base. Don't forget that the sides have to be able to move to pinch and release the jig - only use screws at the back. Don't use glue.\nRip some 3/4\" plywood 3-1/2\" wide for the front side rails. Cut them to length so that they go from the sides of the pinch box to either side of the base. You want to leave a little room for the sides of the pinch box to spread. Now you're ready to drill your first pocket holes using the work station itself!\nInsert the jig and adjust it so that the bottom is flush with the bottom of the pinch box (this is the setting for 3/4\"). Clamp the rails as shown and drill pocket holes at three places to mount them to the base. Clamp a piece of plywood or a straightedge as shown to aid in placing the rails. Glue and fasten the front side rails with pocket hole screws.\nRip more 3/4\" plywood to 3-1/8\" wide to make the back side rails. Making this 3/8\" narrower makes a \"shelf\" on which to mount the optional T-Track. Cut these to length similarly to the front pieces. They don't have to match the length of the front pieces - use what you have. Drill two pocket holes in each piece (not in the same place as the front rails).

This is to set the clamp on so that the clamping force isn't down at the bottom of the workpiece. The clamp listed (which I'm not really thrilled with) has just a bolt to press against the clamped piece. I stuck on a piece of felt made for furniture feet that I happened to have left over from another project. Adjust the bolt as far out as it will go and still feel stable. Then use a piece of 1/2\" (1/2\" is the thinnest practical material for pocket holes) scrap to place the clamp and mark the location of the mounting holes. Pre-drill the holes and mount the clamp with wood screws.\nBefore attaching the adhesive measuring tapes on top of the front rails, sand the tops of the rails smooth with 220 grit sandpaper. A coat of polyurethane will help to give the adhesive tape a smooth mounting surface. Insert the drill bit into the jig and make a mark where the tip of the bit hits the base. This is where a pocket hole will be centered. Measure 2\" from the mark on each of the front rails to show where to position the adhesive measuring tapes. I used the 2\" side of a machinist's 1-2-3 block as shown in the picture. Trim the tapes at either end.\nT-Track might be a bit over the top, but it is handy for stop block(s) if you want to drill a number of like pieces. Cut a piece of T-Track to fit each back rail. Carefully pre-drill the mounting holes and screw in place. You could go all out and get a flip-over stop for the T-Track, but I just made a simple one out of plywood scraps as seen in the picture.\nFinally, I had an old 1-1/4\" shop vacuum hose that I had replaced with a 2-1/2\" one.

You could do this by opening a fixture such as a faucet at the lowest point in the house and this will ensure that there\u2019s no pressurized water inside the pipes when cutting into them. If you\u2019re working in the basement like I am for example, you could drill a small hole where your new fittings will be to allow for most of the water to come out seeing you\u2019re at a lower point.\nWhen there\u2019s no more water coming out the pipe, use the fitting to mark where the cut needs to be made and make the cut. I find that using this type of pipe cutter is so much easier than these as they tend to snag on everything, especially in confined spaces like this. What\u2019s cool about them is you could get a ratcheting handle to make the job a whole lot easier without sacrificing space. There\u2019s gonna be some water left inside the pipe. Now if you can\u2019t get your recipient to fit to catch the water, here\u2019s a cool little trick. Get some aluminum foil and use it to divert the remaining water from the pipe into your recipient, you won\u2019t have any water to pick up like this.

Like I said in the beginning of the video, I\u2019d do a side by side comparison of both normal flux and tinning flux. As you could see, the tinning flux will give you a better chance of getting full coverage because of the solder powder that\u2019s in it. In any case, make sure you are getting a lead-free flux, as some do contain lead which is unwanted for potable water lines. I\u2019ll be using some tinning flux for this demonstration.\nYou need to apply some to both the pipe and the fitting to make sure all the surfaces are properly covered. A big mistake that a lot of beginners make is applying too much flux, only a thin layer is needed and the reason being is that a lot of it is lost inside the pipes when it\u2019s heated and if left there for a while it could eat up the pipe and eventually lead to problems.

As you probably noticed, the joint we need to solder is pretty close the wooden stud so we\u2019ll need to use some precautions.\nIf you got one of these flame protectors, get two thumb tacks and place it around the pipe in a way that anything flammable is protected.

There are 3 things to know at this stage, 1, what to heat, 2 how long to heat and 3, how much solder to use. I like using a low heat for everything in tight spots, starting with the pipe first. The reason why I do it this way, is the fact the between the fitting and pipe is a small gap, and heating the fitting can\u2019t conduct the heat to the pipe properly because of this, so I always heat it up for a couple of seconds prior to heating the fitting. The amount of time you need to spend heating depends on the size pipes you are working with, meaning a \u00bd\u201d pipe will take less long to heat than a \u00be\u201d pipe. The best way to know when to apply your solder is to try it out every now and then, when it gets sucked in, that\u2019s when it\u2019s hot enough. However, you don\u2019t want to wait too long as the flux\u2019ll burn off and you\u2019ll need to restart everything. And for the amount of solder to use it\u2019s easy to know, just use a \u00bd\u201d of solder for \u00bd\u201d pipes and \u00be\u201d of solder for \u00be\u201d pipes. You don\u2019t wanna use more than that, or it\u2019ll end up in the pipe and could cause a restriction, greatly reducing flow.

This is used because it's a good flat surface to work from. Be sure to not get glue on this surface while building the rest.

These were also evenly spaced but, offset slightly to allow for every other row to be slightly off line with the previous row. This allowed for easy access to brad nail the pieces in. I also used a spacer block to align each piece as it went in. This ensured that it was evenly spaced and square.\nNext, the 3/4\" top skin is glued and brad nailed to the grid pattern.

My original hole saw drill I made with an old hole saw that I ground the teeth off of and wrapped it with a single layer of 0.040\" copper sheet. That worked really well and you can see a picture of it on the previous slide.\nThe next hole saw is made using a 3/4\" copper cap. I drilled the center hole with a lathe but if you are careful you should be able to do it with just a drill press. I made the shaft with a 1/4\" bolt, nut and washer. If I did it again I would have used a lock washer and a nylon lock nut because the bolt came loose a couple of times when I was drilling.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVI/LS41/JSEZ61FT/FVILS41JSEZ61FT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIR/Z25W/JSEZ61BO/FIRZ25WJSEZ61BO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWS/RLI3/JSEZ61HF/FWSRLI3JSEZ61HF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVZ/YB2M/JSEZ61MK/FVZYB2MJSEZ61MK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSP/GW5J/JSEZ61P4/FSPGW5JJSEZ61P4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8E/2WLJ/JSEZ61UU/F8E2WLJJSEZ61UU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Make Your Drill"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "To drill the holes you will need to make a dam of modeling clay to hold the grinding compound and water around the drill.

I wanted the uprights to be solid wood, with minimal finishing (simply oil or clear polyurethane), and the shelves painted gray.\nThe bottom shelf is the same color as the other shelves, but much heavier, in order to lower the center of gravity. I therefore used concrete to make the bottom shelf. This makes the lamp rather stable.

The height should be approx. 6\". I created a little alcove under the base, with the idea to place a wifi switch inside, but I then decided not to. The concrete block can be a simple rectangular shape.\nBuild the mold using cheap panels, like melamine. Keep in mind that you will have to be able to easily take it apart, but it should still be sturdy enough to shake it with a hammer. Then run a bead of caulk around the edges, and let it dry. Lastly, mix your concrete with water as directed on the bag, and quickly pour it in the mold and shake it.\nOnce dried, remove the mold, and let it dry a week. You can sand any rough edges with a light grit sander, and fill the holes with epoxy. Then paint it with the color you want, drill 1/2\" diameter holes in each corner, where the center of the uprights will be. Place a threaded rod in each hole, and lock them with epoxy. Make sure that they stay perfectly straight, and are centered!\nLesson learned:\nMake sure that the mold base is level. The cement surface will be level, so if the base is not level, the whole lamp will be leaning like the tower of Pisa. If you made the same mistake as I did, you can correct this later with some shims under the concrete block.\nTip:\nShake well the cement after you poured it in the mold, using a hammer, or with a vibrating tool. And when you think that you shook it enough, shake it some more.

Look at the 4 holes (well 8, if you look at the top and the 'shelf'). Those 4 holes are not going to give us an accurate reading unless we can perfectly center the item we're measuring, which defeats the idea of not having to find the center of the blade. But even if you could find the center every time, there are other mechanical limitations that the springs and even the screw posts have. So what we'll need to do next is create something that will only allow the 'shelf' to extend upwards in a straight path. Enter the glorious over sized Tenon and his beautiful wife, The Mortise. (Please, no connotations here, this is a 'G' platform after all).\nI used a piece of padauk and cut it down on the table saw.

Be sure that you only mark on the piece that you glued on, and not the perpendicular piece attached. I've made a sketchup picture showing exactly what I mean. In the middle, where both lines intersect, take something sharp and puncture it. That's where we'll be drilling next with the drill press.\nThis is where the 1/16\" drill bit comes in. We're going to drill a hole right where that 'X' comes together, but it's only going to be a reference point. After the hole has been drilled, we'll flip the half box over and lay it face down on a scrap of wood. We'll grab our 7/8\" Forestner bit and we'll place the point in the freshly drilled 1/16\" hole. Just a tip, slowing down your drill press is much safer on your project when using large Forestner bits.\nAfter we have a beautifully carved out hole, we'll use our file to square it into a nice mortise. You may have noticed in the video that I used a coping saw, but it is not necessary and could lead to a mistake that might ruin your project, so use it at your own risk. Constantly take the tenon you cut out in the last step and check it to the opening until you're sure you have a perfect fit. A perfect fit is C R I T I C A L!\nNote: Remember, again, that you will be working with a tenon that is a rectangle. After we add a ruler to it, it'll be a nice even square.

Now it's time to make it square. We'll first start off by placing the tenon through the mortise and placing the 'shelf' on the underside of the half box (you have to love all my fancy made up words). We'll do this so that we can run a pencil across the tenon, above the box. We'll cut off the excess and sand until the top of the tenon sits flush with the half box. Perfectly flush.\nNext we'll pull out the tenon and place our ruler (General Tool\u00ae 6\" Stiff Ruler is what I used ) up next to it. We'll position the zero of the ruler to be on the end of the tenon and head to the other end of the tenon where we'll mark a line on the ruler. We'll use an angle grinder to cut off the metal excess and check to make sure that the ruler is not longer than the tenon. If it is, we'll grind the side opposite of the zero until it is slightly shorter than the tenon.\nCutting the ruler\nPhew! Let common sense be your friend on the ruler. Obviously we don't want to cut off the beginning part of the ruler as the excess. Also obvious that we don't want any part of the ruler to stick out of the top of your contraption or we'd have a bad reading when it's time to set it on a blade.\nNow that that's done, I used a steel center punch and put a couple dents about a 1/2\" from the top and bottom of the ruler. I used those to guide my step drill bit and cut up to the 5/16\" step, not going all the way through but leaving a slightly larger pilot hole where the tip of the #8 screw will sit slightly below the metal ruler. We don't want that screw to rub as it passes through the mortise.\nPiloting the screw holes\nFinally, in this step, we'll attach the ruler we cut against the 13/16\" side. We'll move the zero of the ruler flush with the end of the tenon, find the center of the holes we just drilled in the metal, and mark the center with an awl. We'll use an 1/8\" drill bit to drill a pilot hole and drive the screws in, very carefully, maybe even with a screw driver (of all things!). Be sure the zero edge of the ruler is flush with the end of the tenon before cinching the metal tight against the tenon.\nCheck to make sure it fits and slides easily and that it's tight in the mortise, and head onto the next step.\nTenon and his new obsession: the ruler", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFN/C3LC/JS5C36HI/FFNC3LCJS5C36HI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F39/RNY8/JS5C36HM/F39RNY8JS5C36HM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0O/GKE7/JS5C36I4/F0OGKE7JS5C36I4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCN/G840/JS5C36IB/FCNG840JS5C36IB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRF/PRUY/JS5C36M0/FRFPRUYJS5C36M0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7H/JP54/JS5C36N1/F7HJP54JS5C36N1.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Tenon and Measuring Stick"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "That's right, before we make the connection between the 'shelf' and the tenon permanent with wood glue, we'll put a pilot hole through the 'shelf' and the tenon.

I used harry in the last step, but maybe tricky is a better word. Problematic? Thorny? Let's stick with harry.\nIn this step, you'll have to figure out the depth that the aluminum posts will need to have for the included screw to be tight without the 'shelf' being drawn up. That is, you'll have to make sure that the shelf stays flush with the bottom of the half box. This means you'll have to drill a little, check it by inserting the aluminum posts through the bottom and tightening the screws on top. Oh, and the bottom has to remain flush (deeper than flush is probably better), or, again, it'll be inaccurate.\nOn the 'shelf' I used a countersink bit that was larger than the head of the aluminum post. I sank the bit pretty low (about an 1/8\") as that was what was needed for mine. On the top, where the screws will tighten, I used a 1/2\" drill bit, being extremely careful not to drill to far down, as well as keeping it straight and free from tear out. This doesn't need to be complicated, but if you play strictly to instruction and not much to a little outside of the box logic, it might be frustrating.\nAfter you find the sweet spot where the screws are screwed in all the way and both the top and the bottom are recessed, put all four posts in and tighten the included screws (that came with the aluminum posts) in the top. Make sure the shelf is flush and the bottom heads are recessed nicely. Now flip the box over so that the bottom is up and head on over to the next step.\nTIP: Its okay to sand both broad edges (8\" length) of the 'shelf' just a hair. It will have to be able to slide easily.

With the half box still positioned upside down, we'll simply add a bit of glue to the side opposite of the zero on the tenon, slide it through the mortise (lower ruler side up), slide the shelf in and add the screw back.\nGluing...\nOnce the screw is tight and secured, we'll flip it upright. All 4 posts will be in at this stage and we'll slide 2 springs over each post. If you can find a 4\" spring with the spring dimensions I gave (maybe even a 3\" spring), use them. In my part of the world I had a very difficult time finding anything other than the 1 7/8\" spring lengths (again, be very sure you use the exact wire gauge thickness and side that I included in materials).\nThis part can be a little tricky as well, but I found it easier just to leave the 'shelf' sitting upright with all the springs up in the air, and then carefully sliding the half box on top of it. Ease the springs down until the aluminum posts protrude from the holes, and screw in your screws. Once all 4 are secure, we'll flip the half box upside down and add epoxy to the heads of the aluminum posts. We don't want to put too much in, or allow the epoxy to be anywhere in the hole. This, again, is the bottom side of the 'shelf'.

Firstly use kapton tape on all of the conductive services before you start integrating all of the components into the enclosure.

I cut out a curved section for the bottom, creating two points of floor contact for each side. For the tops, I cut out sections for the mortise, but no curve. It would be one long connection to the top. Each bottom and each top piece are two of the strips glued together. This method was an easier way for me to create the mortises.\nAs you can see, this wasn't the best looking work. They work, but needed to be cleaned up.\nAfter cutting the leg pieces to size, I shaped the bottoms to create the tenons to fit into the mortises.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQZ/JLGO/JH6JCBXM/FQZJLGOJH6JCBXM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4M/4ZFY/JH6JCBXW/F4M4ZFYJH6JCBXW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0P/6P9P/JH6JCBMA/F0P6P9PJH6JCBMA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCE/37S0/JH6JCBY5/FCE37S0JH6JCBY5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPB/6MX5/JH6JCBY7/FPB6MX5JH6JCBY7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBG/OLZ0/JH6JCBU6/FBGOLZ0JH6JCBU6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5V/ZDE7/JH6JCBXP/F5VZDE7JH6JCBXP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM4/FITU/JH6JCBBT/FM4FITUJH6JCBBT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV2/FZU2/JH6JCBG6/FV2FZU2JH6JCBG6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Legs and Base"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "After fitting the base pieces together I decided to use bolts on either side of the mortises just to add some stability and a couple of the tenons did not fit as snuggly as I would like.

Sometimes this would delay our completion, then the finishing company had some internal problems, which meant they were unable to take on any new work.\nAfter a lot of research it became evident that because of the cost of a commercial spray booth and the shop area required that purchasing a booth was not practical for our present space. Because of our location a conventional booth would require us to have a make-up air system to heat the incoming air that would be exhausted out, another added expense.\nIMPORTANT NOTE *****\nI decided that we would only be using waterborne lacquers for finishing and no solvent based products.

I would be able to recycle the air providing I could remove all the contaminates.\nToday\u2019s waterborne finishes are comparable with solvent based products; they just take a little longer to dry. And another deciding factor for using a waterborne lacquer was that there is very little odor, compared to the toxic gases given off by solvent based products ( grey cell killers and I need all that I have left ).

I discovered that this concrete yields a super smooth shiny finish if it is poured on a smooth surface. Be creative, even CD covers could work. I used some old floor protector mat pieces as plexiglass is expensive.

It acts differently than Quikcrete. RapidSet Cementall has a plasticity to it and sets really quickly with only a few minutes (less than 10 minutes) of working time so be prepared.\nMix a slightly thicker; less runny version of this mix. You want to make a rough \u2018ring\u2019 of concrete on the plastic. Push it to keep the shape.\nTo facilitate the attachment later of a stand; add a straw into the top and bottom. Make sure it is hidden in the concrete.\nOnce you have the ring about the size you like (make it random shaped as nature is not perfect) place another sheet of plastic on top and wriggle it to flatten. Do not flatten too much! It should be 3/16\u2033 or a bit thicker. If it is very large; thicker is better. Mine are about 8\u2033 or so. The edges SHOULD be quite rough, like stone. Another great thing; this concrete sets in 1 hour!\nTo Make the Hollow Geodes:\nMake a \u2018lump\u2019 out of some plastic bags or wet paper towels and wrap in plastic. Add tape to keep it secure.

Heavy rugged jacket for manly winter things like chopping firewood, a nice running/hiking jacket for those days I feel motivated to exercise, more casual work jacket, plus at least 3-4 hoodies. Usually they either end up draped over various pieces of furniture or stuffed away in my closet. It is messy, doesn't look good, makes things hard to find, causes me to loose my keys, can't drive to work, loose my job, end up living on the street, etc, etc. All because of messy coats. At least that is what I can see happening if I don't clean things up ha ha. That is why I decided it was time to make a coat stand. Not only would it be practical but, if I do it well, class the joint up a bit.\nThe Design:\nI wanted something functional but aesthetically pleasing, not super modern but not rustic tree limb style thing. My brainstorming summed it up in two words, elegant and simplistic. After much sketching and perusing the internet for inspiration I settled on doing three long curved pieces (I'm calling them \"sweeps\") that would be joined about a common axis. I did some rough sketching in Fusion 360 to get a better idea of things like angles and curvature.\nMaterials:\n- Some type of wood, longer than you want the coatstand to be tall (you'll loose some height with the curves, making a fusion model is great for helping with these calculations)\n- I had an 8 foot long beam (2.5\" x 5\") of some nice curly maple.\n- Some smaller cut off pieces to join the sweeps together, I used some nice cherry I had leftover from something else.\n- Scrap wood for making your curving form.\n- Small 1/4 or 3/8 dowel about 12 inches long (I used a black walnut dowel)\nTools:\nTable Saw (nice old workhorse I picked up on craigslist)\nLots of Clamps\nScrews (cheap basic ones)\nBandsaw/Jigsaw\nForstner Bits\nDrill/Drill Press\nJointer\nPlaner\nTitebond\nDanish Oil\nLint Free Rags (I actually get mine from my work, we use them in a clean lab but these look similar)\nOrbital Sander\nSandpaper\nNote: You can probably make do with alot less tools.

I wanted mine to have some moderate curves in the top and bottom of them. There are a few different ways to go about bending wood. The most common techniques are some variation on steam bending (basically get the wood hot and damp while you clamp it into a shape) and laminating up. The steam bending is more commonly used when you want to bend a larger piece, i.e. > 1/8\" in thickness). Laminating is the other route and, in my opinion, a little bit easier.\nEssentially you cut long thin, pliable strips of your material using a table saw or band saw. Then put glue on the adjoining faces and clamp them all together. The trick is you clamp this \"stack\" of thin pieces into a form. A form is a jig that has the shape you want your piece to come out as. No worries if that wasn't clear, it will be soon enough.\n-- I took my maple beam and squared up an edge on my jointer, then started shaving it down on the table saw. I experimented with the thickness until I found a strip thickness that I could bend adequately. Too thick and the strip will break when you bend it. To thin and you will be there the rest of your life trying to glue up layers. Plus you will waste wood when your cutting it down. For my maple, about 3/16 was a good thickness that I could bend. I then cut out 9 strips, mark the order in which you cut them out so you can do your best matching the grain later.\n-- I made my form on a big 4x8 sheet of plywood. I first sketched out with a pencil the general shape I wanted. Once happy with that I cut up a scrap 2x4 and screwed it into the plywood at semi-regular intervals along the curve.\n-- Now, take three of the strips and apply glue to all of the faces that will be touching each other. You don't need to go crazy here as titebond is great stuff and you don't want a thick visible bondline in the finished piece.\n-- I clamped the glued strips together just enough to hold it in one piece while I transferred it to the form. Hold it up against the wall and then start clamping the entire sweep to the wood blocks you screwed in. You need to relax your original clamps here as the strips will each need to bend a little more or less depending on their position (outside of the curve bends more, inside less). Go slowly and make sure things are pulled tight. Once you get it clamped up to the blocks, go back with small c-clamps and where possible clamp up just the sweep as tightly as possible.\n-- Leave for a day...\n-- Repeat for the other two sweeps.\nPro Tip: Try to clamp in all of the same spots for each sweep, this will ensure consistency between the different sweeps.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FG6/6DEQ/JSAOUZY3/FG66DEQJSAOUZY3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFK/P7AQ/JSAOUZY2/FFKP7AQJSAOUZY2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBT/W4ZS/JSAOUZY4/FBTW4ZSJSAOUZY4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAB/HMET/JSAOUZY5/FABHMETJSAOUZY5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS1/O1LS/JSAOUZY6/FS1O1LSJSAOUZY6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL4/RWYO/JSAOUZY7/FL4RWYOJSAOUZY7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8B/NIY1/JSAOUZYB/F8BNIY1JSAOUZYB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWZ/8M19/JSAOUZYF/FWZ8M19JSAOUZYF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F79/045A/JSAOV15Z/F79045AJSAOV15Z.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: The Sweeps"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Awkward name, I do apologize.

Milling the lumber from a rough state to some flat and square pieces is one of those things.\nHow do you mill rough lumber?\nI\u2019ll give you a brief summary of how I did it this time. I start by cutting the pieces to rough length at the miter saw. I usually leave the pieces a little bit long at this point, so they can be refined later. Then, it\u2019s off to the jointer to get one flat face and an edge that is 90 degrees to that face. Then, I take that flat face and put it down in the planer. That\u2019s the reference face, and the planer will make the other side parallel to your flat one.

It really helps when assembling these slatted panels to go slow and take your time. The more careful you are to line all of these up just right, the less time you\u2019ll have to spend sanding later. On the traditional Nelson Bench, I believe the spacer pieces are all one piece and a dado stack is used to create a board with some fingers on it that the slats fit into. I didn\u2019t go that route because I thought it would be faster to just have the spacers and nail them all together. I\u2019m not sure which would be faster. This ended up taking me much longer than I thought it would originally.\nI used an 18ga brad nail gun and some wood glue to attach everything together, and kind of built it up as I went. Occasionally, the nail would split the small spacer pieces, but not very many of them did that, and it was not too bad. I made some spacers that could space evenly from the end small spacer to where the center one would go, both on the top piece and both of the side pieces. That way, I didn\u2019t have to measure each of the 12 times as I built up the slatted panels. I could just use that piece, but the small spacer up to it and nail it in place.\nI just kept building it up and up until the entire panel was made. Then, I took the panels to my crosscut sled and trimmed the ends to be even. This just seemed like the easiest way to accomplish it. Despite being very careful with gluing and nailing, there were still slight differences.\nThen, I ran them through the drum sander a few times on each side\u2026and an even number of times. That way, they were all smooth and the same thickness.\nMISTAKE ALERT: I mess up with my measurements on the height of the sides. I measured to the height of the mini fridge, but I didn\u2019t take into consideration the height of the actual panel on top of that. Well, the panels were about 1.5,\u201d so I was short by that much. It was a pretty easy fix though, since I was able to just nail on a couple of stilt pieces to make up that height difference.\nAfter adding the stilts to the bottom of each side, I tried two different methods to flush them to the slatted panels. The first was to use my router with a flush trim bit in it. This worked ok, but I don\u2019t think I had enough support, because I would not keep it perfectly flat, and I got a couple of places where the bit kind of dug in more than flush. No big deal. On the next one, I decided to just measure the finished thickness of the slatted panels (remember, I sanded them a bit so they were less thick than originally planned) and ripped the additional pieces to that same thickness. That worked much better. The added pieces were a bit longer than the slatted panels, so after I attached them, I just came back with a flush trim saw and took off the part that stuck out.\nOne other thing I had to do was put a small shim on either side of the top panel. After I squared up the top panel, it was slightly too narrow to fit around the fridge.

Also, I paint items in a variety of sizes, from as small as 6\" in length, up to 36\" in length. I started looking at used entertainment systems. I found a lot of them, but none that met my size requirements for both the space in my work area, and/or inner work booth area.\nNext I searched for large cabinets, and found just what I needed, for $35! It has a metal frame with MDF walls. It's heavy! Ideally, you want an all-metal paint booth, due to potential fire hazard, but the MDF walls made a great material to work with for the inner frame assembly, as well as cutting the fume outlet.\nI cleaned the dust off, moved it into place, and painted the outside of the cabinet to brighten up my work area.

The L bars came in 8' lengths. The 45\u00b0 cuts were made on a miter saw, with a normal wood cutting blade. Being that the bars are aluminum, they can be cut by hand with a hand saw, but the process will take much more time. The L bars are held together in the corners with screws through a small 90\u00b0 metal bracket, backed by wooden supports.\nInstead of buying expensive wire mesh to support the fiberglass in the holding frames, I used chicken wire I already had sitting around. This made a cost effective solution, but was in no way, easy work. The chicken wire wraps underneath each wooden support along the metal frame. I had to individually remove each wood support, stretch the wire tight to that point, put the wood support back in place, and then screw it down.\nI made three individual holding frames, each one the width of the interior of the cabinet. I divided the length of the stud frame by three, to get the individual lengths for each filter frame segment. Because the filter wall frame leans back, these filter holding frames easily stack on top of each other without the need to be anchored to the stud frame. Why not make it one big filter frame? I purposely chose to use three segments for efficiency. I knew the filters would build up paint over spay, quicker, in specific areas.

I used an HVAC fan for two reasons. First, it's made to be strong enough to push air through a home duct/ventilation system. Since my booth is larger than a bench top version, I wanted to be sure my fan would properly evacuate paint fumes from my painting space. Second, I already had one at my disposal.\nThe motor of my fan is not explosion proof, so I had to make modifications to the fan housing. Instead of the fan setting INSIDE of the booth behind the filter wall, and exhausting out of the booth, it had to set on the OUTSIDE of the booth, drawing out the fumes from inside the booth.\nTo modify the fan housing, I first removed the metal shield grid from the housing that would be the inlet side. The opening there is about 10\". I mounted a 10\" take off to the inlet with machine screws. The take off has a self adhesive strip, but I also went around it with duct tape. Screws, adhesive strip, and duct tape. I don't mind overkill sealing this off, since the whole point of this is to prevent toxic fumes in my work area.\nThe next modification I made was to the fan outlet. I had to go from a rectangle, to a circle ( 8\" take off ), to accommodate for the outlet duct. I removed the shield grid and cut two pieces of thin sheet polycarbonate to match the size of the grid. I traced the diameter of the 8\" take off onto the polycarbonate, and cut it out with a jig saw. I bolted the polycarbonate sheets together, one on the outside of the shield, and the other on the inside. The 8\" take off was mounted to the polycarbonate, over the cut out holes, with an adhesive strip, and bolts. I caulked the bolts, and every edge of the polycarbonate sheets for a maximum seal.

I just purchased a spare set online.\nInstead of clamping down on a tire, you can clamp down on the object you want to hold like in our need case, loose wires for tinning or maybe a strip of neopixels or a tiny circuit board for soldering.\nA great way to use up scrap pieces of wood around the shop, build the mounts for the bicycle brakes to be turned into a clamping device. Although, you would still end up with smaller scraps of wood to save.\nThe hand brake lever will be mounted on a stable footboard to use as a foot pedal. Since the brake handle is built with a round clamp that is supposed to wrap around a round handlebar, I used a dowel mounted to an upright in the pedal board to simulate the handlebar.\nI also built a platform piece to make a larger pedal pad so it would be easier to operate the brake lever with a foot press. The pedal is attached to the brake lever with tie-wraps that go through holes drilled in the side of the trough that the lever sits in.\nYou can also adapt the pedal foot mechanism to be mounted on the underside in front of your workbench or table so you can activate it with the knee when you press against it. They have these knee controls on industrial sewing machines where you can lift the presser foot without moving your hands off the workpiece of if you need your hands to operate a pair of scissors or holding a soldering iron.

So we picked up a piece of Australian Red Cedar with an awesome live edge. It's a hard-wood in the mahogany family so it has a really nice deep red heartwood and bright yellow sapwood.\nAlthough it's pretty, we had some big issues with wood movement due to it likely being dried too quickly...but we'll get to that later.\nWe only needed the live-edge for this project and not the entire board so we marked a line using a straight-edge of where to cut. We weren't 100% sure how much material we needed at this point because too much planning isn't always our thing, so we left plenty of extra room.\nNext, we ripped off the live-edge at the band-saw. If you look at the back of the board in the band-saw picture, you can see it flexed open about 1/2\" as we ripped it. 1/2\" of flex over 48\" is MASSIVE. This is a great example of why doing initial rips at the band-saw is a smart idea, if you have the means to. If this had been done at the table-saw, all of that flex would be up against the blade and it creates a potentially dangerous situation.\nThe flex is (typically) due to something called \"case hardening\", which basically means the board wasn't dried in the best way for woodworking. When you rip it down the middle, all of the tension is released and it turns your flat board into a potato chip.\nLastly, we're going to make the \"river\" from the live-edges of the two halves put together so we cross-cut it in half at the bench. You could use any saw for this, just need to turn one board into two boards.\nTip: If you have the means to, using a band-saw for your rough \"rips\" is a safer option than using a table saw. Not to mention the kerf of the blade is smaller so you're saving more material! We still use the table saw later when cutting to final size, but rough ripping is always done on the band saw.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7Y/778U/JS0OR48M/F7Y778UJS0OR48M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F36/9KHD/JS0OR48O/F369KHDJS0OR48O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZF/0UA3/JS0OR49W/FZF0UA3JS0OR49W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG1/D3PY/JS0OR49X/FG1D3PYJS0OR49X.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Getting Started With Our Material: Australian Red Cedar"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Next, we milled the wood to get it flat and straight. In the several minutes between ripping the live-edge off and moving to the jointer, the board had already moved a LOT due to all the released tension. It was relatively straight when we bought it and turned into a potato chip shape pretty quick once we began milling.\nIt took a lot more passes than normal at the jointer to get it flat, which resulted in the boards being quite a bit thinner than anticipated. This wood movement issue would continue to mess with us throughout the whole project...\nAfter fighting with it for a bit, we got things looking nice and flat and straight. The ideal thing would have been to let it sit a few days (or longer) to finish it's initial movement and then repeat the milling process. This gives the wood enough time to come into equilibrium before actually starting the project. This way it would have moved a lot less later on. Hindsight, etc. etc.\nA quick pass at the table-saw took care of the extra material we didn't need. Since this is a final size and we'd already released the initial tensions over at the band-saw, it was fine to make the cuts on the table-saw. That being said, you could still easily do it on a band-saw or circular-saw since it isn't critical that it's straight for this project.\nTip: Wood moves! Even long after it's been \"dry\", any cutting or milling can expose moisture to the wood and release internal tension. For best results, when you bring home a new piece of wood, give it some time to acclimate to your shop environment. If you need to mill it and remove a lot of material, the best way to do that is to mill it, let it rest a few days, then mill it some more, to let it acclimate slowly.

This would be easy enough to cut at a miter saw or with a circular saw as well. This is just the fastest way for us to do it. We wanted the ends to be square to the back edge which would make it easier when we build the form for pouring the epoxy.\nThe live edge was free of bark but still had a lot of fibrous material on it so we used 'dragon skin' which is like a metal sandpaper to scrub it off.

We ripped and cut a few pieces down to size.\nThe purpose of the form is to hold the two river pieces inside and create a space between the live edges that the epoxy will pour into. That meant it had to fit the wood pieces as perfectly as possible to prevent leaks.\nWe covered the interior faces of the form in packing tape so the epoxy wouldn't stick to it. Packing tape is definitely not a good choice if you're trying to block up a crack or hole in the wood to hold the epoxy in, but it's good if you're just trying to prevent the epoxy from sticking to something else.\nTo hold the form together we used these Spax MDF screws.

Almost all of the ink had pooled together near the surface and then moved to both of the sides. The mother of pearl flakes had all sank to the bottom and were flat on the surface of the bottom. On top of that, some of the epoxy leaked under the boards so the flakes were actually below the surface of the wood. (Gravity...) AND on top of all that, the wood had kept on moving and twisted back up after milling. The whole thing was totally out of flat again and wobbling all over the place. Not the greatest sequence of events.\nWith limited options that didn't involve starting over, I had the bright idea to run it through the planer to try and at least get some flat areas to work with. In doing that, the first pass sheered off all of the mother of pearl flakes on the bottom.\n(Jaimie was SUPER happy about that. Not my best work.)\nAfter a lot of nonsense, I ended up starting at 80 grit and sanding it all back to as flat as I could. In doing that we took of what was left of the flakes and a lot of the ink that was on the surface. What we ended up with was a turquoise-ish epoxy river. Not at all what we'd planned for but it still looked alright. We started at 80 and sanded up to 320 with the orbital sander.\nIn the end, we decided to flip it over and use what was originally going to be the bottom as the top, since the flakes were gone and it would hide the weird ink spots on the surface.\nTip: Sanding and polishing epoxy back to a pure, see-through gloss requires a LOT of effort.

In my following instrucatables I'll try demontrate them, along with different materials you can cut with this tool.\nSo,let's begin.\nAt the moment when I decided to make a guillotine cutter, for my workshop, I was able to find only one single tutorial on Youtube - this one:\nFor me the problem was that I didn't have neither a good quality steel for making massive blade, nor more or less capable power tools for working it.

While I don't think it was the first time I saw a marking device of that type, it intrigued me. A sharp blade, known as a wheel, slices into the wood and creates your mark. Now, I have a marking device like this, a mortise gauge, that uses a similar concept, except instead of cutting the wood with a wheel, it puts more of a scratch on the surface.\nSome love this concept, I don't. I have been a fan of pencil wielding ever since I pushed my first block of pine through a bandsaw in Mr. Fairchild's junior high woodshop to create a salt shaker (or was it a piggy bank?). But one particular thing I enjoyed very much about that wheel marking gauge that wasn't a part of my mortise gauge, was the measuring feature. Set your mark, drag your line and your done. This removes looking for a ruler or a tape measure before setting the gauge, something I spend a lot of time doing.\nThe other problem I wanted to solve when I started this project was locking my marking device without actually turning a knob and bumping it out of alignment (call me clumsy), or, I'll say it, my infinite ability to be lazy. Instead of a knob, I used rare earth metal magnets to give it a little friction.

An adjustable follower is attached to the front of the Angle Grinder Assembly, and calibrated to be inline with the cutter as seen in the photo.\nA table with a steel top is bolted to the bed of the lathe between centers. The steel provides a smooth surface for the duplicator to slide over, and the steel provides a magnetic surface for the Magswitches on the template mounts. The bottom should be waxed with paste wax to reduce friction.\nPatterns are one half of a full scale profile split on its center-line, printed on paper and glued to 3/16\" (5mm) plywood. These are attached to a template mount with screws, and positioned on the table in relative to the stock location between centers as well as the center line of the lathe. Finally, the template mounts are locked into location with the Magswitches.\nLoosen the handle on the follower, and adjust the depth of cut turret to the highest setting. Move the follower until the calibration screw contacts the depth of cut turret and tighten the handle again. The duplicator will work if the lathe is turning in the forward direction, but I recommend running the lathe in reverse. Now, start the lathe and adjust the speed to 650 RPM. This is the recommended speed suggested by the manufacturer of the cutter. Next, start the Angle Grinder, and begin taking cuts on the stock. Follow the edge of the template, and work the stock down slowly in the deep sections of the template. After each pass, stop the Angle Grinder and adjust the depth of cut turret to the next level, and make another pass.\nRoughing the stock is much easier and safer if shims are used to guide the duplicator along the piece to remove only the desired depth of cut. The best results are made with a slow steady movement, and less aggressive material removal.\nWARNING!\nThe cutting blades recommended for this project are very aggressive, and can remove a lot of material at once.

My expectations were high. I hoped to duplicate intricate turning details, but found this technique produced chip-out on details such as a quarter rounds, beads and v-grooves. It should be noted at this point in time, the only species of wood I've used thus far has been hickory/pecan which is notorious for chip-out. I hope to get better results with hard maple, but my expectations are much lower now. Avoiding chip-out required a modification to the templates with epoxy glue to fill in the areas of vulnerable pattern details.\nThe intricate details are completed with regular woodturning tools, and the use of a tool rest and banjo that can be Magswitch mounted to the table. One of the greatest benefits is the ability to create many pieces that look identical with a little extra hand turning and sanding. Several years ago I built a four poster bed, and each post is a little different. Most people won't notice, but I always will.\nI mentioned the King Arthur's Tools 45822 Lancelot 22 tooth cutter in the Parts and Materials section, but I do not have any experience with cutter. One reason I didn't use the Lancelot was the width of the kerf and it would require sharpening more often than the carbide Viel cutter. I've seen the results of this cutter in several videos (for example The Homestead Craftman), and the finish looks satisfactory. This cutter cannot reproduce detail either as a result of the kerf size. I choose the Viel Cutter because it was used on a commercially available Lathe Duplicator at the time I purchased it...So, it must be great. Right?! Currently, this duplicator and Angle Grinder Attachment don't appear to be available...Enough said. The Viel Carbide Cutter is still being sold, and is still very expensive.\nI would recommend this device if you have the need to reproduce several identical turnings. But, don't expect a perfect finish after the final pass. However, the finish is good enough to refine in a short period of time with sandpaper. The proof of the results can be seen in the 60+ spindles I produced. I am extremely satisfied. More information about how I turned these spindles can be found at Woodturning Slender Spindles.\nFinally, build and use this device at your own risk.

It uses the hydraulic equivalent of a mechanical lever, and was also known as a Bramah press after the inventor, Joseph Bramah, of England. He invented and was issued a patent on this press in 1795. As Bramah (who is also known for his development of the flush toilet) installed toilets, he studied the existing literature on the motion of fluids and put this knowledge into the development of the press.\nMain principle\nThe hydraulic press depends on Pascal's principle-the pressure throughout a closed system is constant. One part of the system is a piston acting as a pump, with a modest mechanical force acting on a small cross-sectional area; the other part is a piston with a larger area which generates a correspondingly large mechanical force. Only small-diameter tubing (which more easily resists pressure) is needed if the pump is separated from the press cylinder.\nPascal's law: Pressure on a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished and acts with equal force on equal areas and at 90 degrees to the container wall.\nA small effort force acts on a small piston. This creates a pressure which is transferred through the hydraulic fluid to a large piston\nApplication\nHydraulic presses are commonly used for forging, clinching, moulding, blanking, punching, deep drawing, and metal forming operations. With the growth and importance of light-weighting in the aerospace and automotive industry, more applications are present in Thermoplastics, Composites, SMC Sheet Molded Composites, RTM Resin Transfer Molding, GMT Glass Mat Transfer and Carbon Fiber Molding. All of these applications require precise control and repeat-ability. wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_press", "title": "DIY Hydraulic Benchtop Press", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Hydraulic-Benchtop-Press/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Remember Safety First.\nWelding Cutting and Grinding Tools are Dangerous!\nDo it at your own Risk!\nUse Always the Suitable Protective Equipment.\n\nAngle grinder 115mm (4 \u00bd\u201d) or 125mm (5\u201d)\nCutting disks according to grinder \u00f8115x1mm (\u00f84 \u00bd\u201d x 0.04\u201d) or (\u00f8125 x 1mm/ \u00f8 5\u201d x 0.04\u201d)\nFlap Disk Grinding Wheel\nDrill press\nDrill bits \u00f83 / 4 / 4.5 / 5 / 6 / 6.8 / 8 / 8.5 / 10 / 10.2 / 12 / 16 / 16.5mm\nCountersinks\nCenter punch \u00f83mm \u00f84.5mm \u00f88mm,\nTaps set M12 / M8 / M6 / M5\nTap handle\nWelding machine\nWelding Mask\nWelding gloves\nWelder magnetic angles\nTape measure\nCaliper\nPen Scriber\nBenchtop Vise\nDrill press Vise\nClamps\nVice grips\nWrenches 10-11 / 12-13 / 18-19mm\nAllen Keys 4 / 5mm\nScrewdrivers\nHammer\nSteel stock pieces at vary dimensions and shapes", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Tools"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Tube80x40x2mm 2pcs 348mm\nTube60x40x2mm 2pcs 640mm\nAngle iron40x40x4mm 2pcs 70mm\nFlat bar70x5mm 2pcs 335mm, 2pcs 290mm, 4pcs 35mm & 1pcs 185mm\nFlat bar 40x3mm 2pcs 60mm\nFlat bar 40x5mm 1pcs 100mm,& 1pcs about 500mm for the making of the 8 rhombuses\nFlat bar 40x10mm 1pcs 340mm & 1pcs 160\nPlate120x8mm 4pcs150mm\nPlate80x8mm 4pcs 150mm 1pcs 165mm\nSquare bar 14x14mm 2pcs 150mm\nRod \u00f83stainless steel 2pcs 20mm 1pcs about 50~60mm\nRod \u00f816 1pcs 185mm\nRod \u00f810 2pcs 240mm 1pcs 100mm\nAxle \u00f812 2pcs 230mm\nBolt M12 1pcs 60mm\nStud bolt M12 2pcs 220mm\nNuts M12 10pcs\nWashers M12 10pcs\nBolts M8 10pcs\nNuts M8 10pcs\nBolts M6 10pcs x40mm\nNuts M6 10pcs\nBolts M5 8pcs 20mm\nNuts M5 8pcs\nElectrodes 6013 2.5mm\nHose Fitting 1pcs per jack\nPlastic pipe according the hose fitting about 500~600mm\nBottle from refreshment juice for the extra oil container", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: Materials"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUY/4D6N/JR4TFIKW/FUY4D6NJR4TFIKW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOW/ME02/JREUCJWU/FOWME02JREUCJWU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU0/QLY6/JRBBMRC0/FU0QLY6JRBBMRC0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMT/K3AQ/JRBBNW2E/FMTK3AQJRBBNW2E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1T/RJYH/JRBBNTI0/F1TRJYHJRBBNTI0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRK/H2Z3/JRBBNTHX/FRKH2Z3JRBBNTHX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB8/WFQT/JREUCJTA/FB8WFQTJREUCJTA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHU/0P6V/JRGOJJ2Y/FHU0P6VJRGOJJ2Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT4/52UD/JRGOMSGC/FT452UDJRGOMSGC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVW/UPJ9/JRKYRGMT/FVWUPJ9JRKYRGMT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F19/6G4K/JRV8BQZE/F196G4KJRV8BQZE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGN/QF4P/JRGOOP9V/FGNQF4PJRGOOP9V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZN/WRIR/JRGOMVTX/FZNWRIRJRGOMVTX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Plans"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "1.

At the up side of vertical tubes weld a piece of flat bar 40x3x60mm\n7. Complete the welds and mark the centers at the front and back side of horizontal tubes.\nThey will needed later to installing the beds.\n8. Prepare 2 pieces of flat bar 70x5x335mm and then weld at the inner side of the horizontal tubes as substructure for the beds.\n9. Make 8 pieces from flat bar 40x5mm at rhomb shape to strengthen the joints of frame. (See the sketch at the photo). Leave 1mm gap between the marks of each piece for the wastage of cutting, or you can mark and cut one by one.\n10. Weld the rhombuses according the plan at photo1\n11. Installing the beds.\nNow using the marks of step7 we find the centers at the beds substructure and do a hole 4.5mm and no deeper than 4.5mm.\n12. Prepare the plates (120x8x150mm) that we will use for beds. Mark the orientation of the plates. Then using the first one as model, we make the five holes using the same orientation at all plates.\n13. At the upper plate that we will use for jack base cut four M12 threads. Using a drill bit 4.5mm as guide we place the plate at the main frame onto the substructure. The hole at the plate's center is 4.5mm too. Adjust the plate and welded onto substructure only at the left/right sides.\n14. Use the same method to install the second plate (Mold bed).\n15. Truss\nFor the truss we will need two pieces 240mm of a rod \u00f810mm and one 185mm of a rod \u00f816mm and one piece of flat bar 40x5x100mm.\nAt the midle of flat bar 40x5x100mm do hole \u00f816.5mm and at the midle of upper tube do a hole \u00f816mm using\n\u00f84-8-12-16/16.5mm drill bits.\nPlace the flat bar onto the tube, place adjust the \u00f816mm rod into the hole.\nThe bar must be supported on the underside of the tube and be perpendicular.\nTack welds the bar onto the tube and then weld.\nWeld the rod around the hole at the flat bar.\nPrepare the two \u00f810mm rod members of truss.\nPlace - adjust - tack welds - Weld.\nVideo: My Hydraulic Benchtop Press Main Frame-Hydraulic Jack-Frame Footings", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVC/PJW9/JR4TES7Z/FVCPJW9JR4TES7Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIW/H7KL/JR4TESBK/FIWH7KLJR4TESBK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX7/YET8/JR4TESMW/FX7YET8JR4TESMW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWE/KMOT/JR4TESE8/FWEKMOTJR4TESE8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOL/O331/JR4TESJ8/FOLO331JR4TESJ8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJL/ZS50/JR4TESQC/FJLZS50JR4TESQC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F58/ZJV5/JR4TESU5/F58ZJV5JR4TESU5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB8/QH19/JR4TETRU/FB8QH19JR4TETRU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5H/4852/JR4TEU2R/F5H4852JR4TEU2R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCP/V2E7/JR4TEU65/FCPV2E7JR4TEU65.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKR/CT4A/JR4TEUAJ/FKRCT4AJR4TEUAJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTB/7F6O/JR4TEWK3/FTB7F6OJR4TEWK3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLL/YWOV/JR4TEYQV/FLLYWOVJR4TEYQV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3D/2JAD/JR4TEYRE/F3D2JADJR4TEYRE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSM/SPA8/JR4TEZPB/FSMSPA8JR4TEZPB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMN/20N6/JR4TEZV9/FMN20N6JR4TEZV9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9W/AN0H/JR4TF04I/F9WAN0HJR4TF04I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIX/AO4T/JR4TF1R9/FIXAO4TJR4TF1R9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK1/KH2G/JR4TF3C4/FK1KH2GJR4TF3C4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYB/B3IM/JR4TF4I6/FYBB3IMJR4TF4I6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2G/1VOJ/JR4TF5PI/F2G1VOJJR4TF5PI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNV/Y51H/JR4TF6Y7/FNVY51HJR4TF6Y7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F76/OZRP/JR4TF9DM/F76OZRPJR4TF9DM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5M/IGLX/JR4TF9QR/F5MIGLXJR4TF9QR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2T/5RGM/JR4TF9YD/F2T5RGMJR4TF9YD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ7/48Q9/JR4TFAID/FZ748Q9JR4TFAID.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNY/CK0Y/JR4TFAKX/FNYCK0YJR4TFAKX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT0/554R/JR4TFHRD/FT0554RJR4TFHRD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAU/9H5D/JR4TFI5I/FAU9H5DJR4TFI5I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUG/4HG5/JR6OD21Q/FUG4HG5JR6OD21Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F10/SA4N/JR6OD34Z/F10SA4NJR6OD34Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F96/9ANM/JR6ODAKT/F969ANMJR6ODAKT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2W/BTBK/JR6ODBAD/F2WBTBKJR6ODBAD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0E/GFF9/JRAYMEYW/F0EGFF9JRAYMEYW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3Z/8HNG/JRAYMEZ3/F3Z8HNGJRAYMEZ3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQW/SU5E/JRAYMHAH/FQWSU5EJRAYMHAH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Main Frame"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Base\nFor Jack base we will use a piece flat bar 70x5x185mm with a hole at the middle about \u00f836mm and two holes \u00f812.5mm near the edges.\nFrom the first hole would be pass the cylinder.

{"step": 8, "steps_text": "Bending Die I.\nSuitable for bending flat, square bars, rods and sheet metals.\nPunch / Male Die\nFor this making I used a piece of steel \u00f824mmx85mm.\nIt is a very simple make and need only a hole with a M8 thread. (By the same way we can make a punch at any dia).\nI haven't a lathe, so I used my Circle Center Finder Tool, to find the center that would become the hole.\nIf you interested for this build you can view my instructable:\nDIY Circle Center Finder Tool, Stainless Steel Made\nUsing my drill press made the needed \u00f86.8mm hole starting with \u00f84mm drill bit and threading a M8 thread.\nCut the head of an M8x40mm bolt, and screw two M8 nuts at the thread.\nUsing two wrenches (Num.13) tighten reversely between them till locked\nUsing a wrench screw the thread at the punch\nLoosen / remove the nuts.\nScrew the punch's thread at the support's bed.\nForming / Bending Female Die\nIn use with the punch and a piece of rod can do bends at vary radius, according the rod diameter.\nFor this make we will need a plate 80x150x8mm 2 pieces of rod \u00f820x100mm and 2 pieces from flat bar 40x5mm at rhomb shape.\nPlace/adjust and tack weld the rods near the edges onto the plate and then tighten using the press or the vise. Weld with two tack welds about 35mm. Let it cool down and weld the other side of rods. Let it again to cool down and straighten the plate using the press.\nWith the male die attached at the support bed place the female die at the press bed, lower it and centering using two pieces of flat bar 3mm, and tighten the press. Remember the punch dia is 24mmm, plus 6mm the two pieces of flat bar, total 30mm. The gap between the two rods at female die is 30mm too (see the plan). Place the rhomb pieces, mark and drill the holes (\u00f89mm), secure the rhombus at the bed's holes with M8 bolts/nuts. Weld two tack welds about 15mm.\nRelease/remove the female die from press, turn it upside down, and using a cutting disk 3mm make a groove about 4mm till the root of the welds.\nPlace it again at the bed, screw the bolts and tighten the press.\nBefore proceed to welding oiling the axles to protect them from splatters.\nWeld filling weld at each groove.\nLet it to cool down.\nUse a flap grinding wheel to grind the welds and refine with a file.\nFirst tests\n2T jack - flat bar 3mm - 90\u00b0 bend - ok\n2T jack - stainless steel sheet metal at thickness 0.70mm (used at punch die: rod \u00f810, \u00f820 & square bar 10mm) - 90\u00b0 bend with big radius - ok\n2T jack - flat bar 40x5mm - 90\u00b0 bend - ok\n3T jack - flat bar 70x5mm - 90\u00b0 bend - ok\nBending Die II.\nForming / Bending Female Die\nFor this make we will need a plate 120x150x8mm,and 2pieces of angle iron (L profile) 25x25x3x150mm. Place/adjust the angle iron pieces onto the plate leaving a gap 3mm between them using a piece of flat bar 3mm thick. Tighten using the press and a pice of steel stock. Weld tack welds at the outer sides and let it cool down. Remove the flat bar and weld tack welds at the inner sides. Refine the welds at the inner joint of angle iron pieces using at first a flat file and then a triangle file.\nI made from a 0.90mm thick galvanized sheet metal, two load supports with a load guide at the back one, for repeatable tasks. This add on is optional but I think that is very helpful and too easy to made. Needed a piece of threaded rod M6 about 200mm, 2 bolts & 3 nuts M6, 2 bolts & 2 nuts M5, a piece of aluminum profile as at the photos, and a piece of \u00f83mm stainless steel rod about 50mm.\nPunch / Male Die\nFor this make we will need one plate 80x165x8mm for base, one plate 80x150x8mm for blade, and 2pieces of square bar 14x14x150mm to securing the blade onto the base.\nPlace the first one piece of the square bar onto the base at 22mm distance from edge and use the press to keep it in place. Weld tack welds at the short edges. Release the press, place the blade and check/adjust the perpendicularity and tighten using the press.\nPlace the second piece of square bars in place and secure it using two vise grips (square bar-blade-square bar). Weld three tuck welds at each pair of square bar/base.\nRelease the press, place 2pcs of rod \u00f820x100mm onto the middle of square bars and tighten by press. Weld four tuck welds at each pair of square bar/blade.\nLet it cool down.\nMake four \u00f89mm holes at the base, according the dimensioning of the holes at the movable support bed.\nSharpening the Blade\nPaint the blade with Aniline paint about 20mm from the edge at both sides. (You can make it using 400ml Alcohol, 50ml Shellac, 20ml Aniline and a very good shake, until dissolved the shellac completely).\nPlace the male die onto vice using a rectangular piece of stock steel at the blade's edge. Mark a line at 10mm distance from the blade's edge using as guide a plate 10mm thick and then mark a second line at 8mm distance from the blade's edge using as guide a plate 8mm thick.(see plan and photos). Do the same at the opposite side.\nAt the blade down side, mark two lines at 2mm distance from the edges, and one at the middle.\nPlace the blade vertically at the vice. Using a grinder with a new 3mm cutting disc, grind the blade at the both sides till the line of 8mm, slowly and carefully.\nUsing a file refine the grinding till the line of 10mm at the both sides.\nBy the eye, refine the grinding at the down side creating an acme of 2mm.\nFirst tests\nGalvanized Sheet Metal at 0.90mm thickness - 90\u00b0 bends - ok\nVideo: My Hydraulic Benchtop Press Add

For me, this usually meant that I ended up with different stacks of paper on my bench or table. This did not look nice and also was not very practical.\nSo I decided to make myself a wooden magazine rack. I wanted it to have at least four shelves, and I wanted a modern design to fit with my dining table and bench.\nI have only basic woodworking skills and limited access to woodworking tools. Yet as I have access to a laser cutter, I chose to make the magazine rack using the laser cutter. I am sure somebody with more skill, can come up with a better way to construct the magazine rack. I am also pretty sure that with a CNC router the building could be done much more efficient. Of course, another option would have been to simplify the design, but I had a certain image in my mind and wanted to test if it was possible to create it with the laser cutter as the main tool.\nMaterial:\n4 mm Birch plywood\n4 mm Clear acrylic\nSandpaper (120 grit)\nWood glue\nTools:\nLaser cutter\nClamps\nBelt/disc sander (recommended)", "title": "Make a Wooden Magazine Rack With a Laser Cutter", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-Wooden-Magazine-Rack-With-a-Laser-Cutter/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "First I did some freehand sketching of different shapes.

I am quite new to Fusion. I have done some beginner tutorials and played around with it, but the magazine rack was the first real project for me.\nBelow you can see a quick rendering of the final design. I decided to use acrylic as part of the shelves because I like the look of the wood combined with the transparent acrylic. Acrylic also has the advantage that it can be cut with a laser cutter and it is not as fragile as glass.\nI really learned a lot during the making. At some parts, it was also a bit frustrating, like when I found out the hard way that it is not a good idea just to ignore the automatic Fusion 360 warnings. I had my model completely finished but when I wanted to rearrange the parts of the rack to create files for cutting, I ended up with multiple errors.

This script takes your parts from different locations and in different orientations and places them next to each other on a flat plane. It is not perfect because sometimes you can get overlapping parts and you still need to do some manual re-arranging but it is a huge time saver.\nThe second tutorial explains how to create DXF files with automatic kerf compensation in Fusion. I later imported the DXF files into Inkscape and turned them into SVG files.\nWhen I finally had the file ready, I arranged all the parts on five 60 x 30 cm (24 x 12 in) sheets of birch plywood and cut them on the laser cutter. I choose the birch plywood because I like the look of it and it is also harder than for example poplar which gives more structural strength.\nThe total cost for the wood was about 14 \u20ac (16 $) and 17 \u20ac (19 $) for a 50 x 50 cm (20 x 20 in) sheet of acrylic.\nHere you can download the files for laser cutting as SVG or PDF.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: Fusion File Export and Laser Cutting"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Once all the parts were laser cut, I sorted them and made stacks of similar parts.

In order to hang one bicycle I needed 4 rollers. This put me over $100 per bike. This was getting expensive. Instead, I designed the body of the rollers to be 3d printed. To complete the roller assemblies, all I needed to buy was 5/16\" nuts, bolts, and washers, and some 5/16\" steel rod for the bearing axles. Oh, and some bearings. My first test run used some old roller blade bearings. I then ordered a box of 200 bearings on ebay for $20. I scoured the internet for the best deal on the Park bicycle hangers. I managed to get them for just under $4 a piece.\nI went through a few design changes to get the best clearance for the roller assemblies, and then I put the printer to work. The printing, as many of you know is quite time consuming.

My goal was to create a final piece with a kind of \"Dr. Seuss\" feel to it if that makes any sense. The layers allowed me to play with layers like he did with colors. Also, whenever you see a strange shape like this it tends to be mirrored or symmetrical but I wanted to do the opposite of that.

Since my frame is square, the length of the boards equals the width of the frame for half of the boards and the other half of the boards are cut down to a length equal to the width of the frame minus 2x the width of the slats.

So I just connect the line that I drew on the top surface with the layer that I want at the bottom of the contour and rinse and repeat on all 4 sides all just with the Turbo Plane.\nNow the inside edge gets the same treatment, but these edges are harder to reach so I mount the frame vertically in my bench vise to help reach the areas easier while I dish out the contours.

The surface in the larger contours are already in good shape because of the clean cut left behind by the carbide cutters on the Turbo Plane. But the end grain and anywhere there are tighter areas and transitional surfaces, these need a bit more work which is where the Mini Grinder sanding attachment really shines, much like myself.\nAnd the final power carving tool that I need to complete the frame is the Contour Sander which I use for all of the finish sanding.

The tenons were cut by mounting the blanks in the Spigot Jaws of the chuck and running the lathe at a very slow speed.

Tighten the wingnut again to firmly seat the chucks morse taper in the tailstock.\nPlacing the stock in tension stiffens it, thus reducing the amount of vibration from tool pressure and/or the compressive forces generated by the tailstock ram.\nAs seen in the photos above, this method is capable of exerting 100 lbs of force on the blank without either chuck slipping. While using this setup, I probably wasn't exerting more than 15 or 20 lbs of tension on the work piece, but this is only a guess.\nMore information about calculated and experimental results of different work piece mounting methods can be found at the American Association of Woodturners (AAW) written by Dennis J Gooding, \"AN ENGINEER\u2019S LOOK AT TURNING SLENDER WOOD SPINDLES\".", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8P/T0OE/JRQOMC4Q/F8PT0OEJRQOMC4Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F73/JUS2/JRQOM9DY/F73JUS2JRQOM9DY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6T/97G7/JRQOM9EE/F6T97G7JRQOM9EE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8V/53UK/JRQOM9EF/F8V53UKJRQOM9EF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMM/PXGT/JRQOM9DV/FMMPXGTJRQOM9DV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: How It Works"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The photo of the lathe duplicator shows an example of spindles being turned between centers.

These were made using a lathe duplicator. The finish required some sanding, but overall the results were great. Turning thin spindles with a hand tool using this technique should yield good results as well, as Dennis J. Gooding confirmed in his article.\nInstructions for building my duplicator seen above can be found at Wood Lathe Duplicator With Angle Grinder.\nOne thing I noticed after turning very thin pieces (5/16\" or 8mm) the spindles behaved like torsion springs. With the lathe stopped and the work piece in both chucks, I could twist the collet chuck a few degrees and release it which resulted in a slight oscillation axially for a very short period of time. I cannot say for certain how this affected my results, but the 2 lb 6 oz (1.07 kg) weight of the collet + collet chuck + adapter probably affected the results one way or the other.

Our earliest ancestors shaped the materials at their disposal into tools that allowed them to survive and thrive in what were often harsh and untenable environments. Among those earliest of tools were stone knives. Cultures throughout the centuries have made knives in vast varieties and styles to suit their specific purposes and bladed instruments have a long and storied history of use as tools, status symbols, religious instruments, accessories, and much more.\n\nAmong my favorite types of knives are kiridashi. Originally designed in Japan as a woodworking tool, these simple yet elegant blades are perfectly suited to a modern lifestyle as a pocket knife, box opener, paper cutter, craft assistant, nail cleaner, or, of course, even a woodworking tool. Sleek, stylish, simple, and incredibly useful, the kiridashi has taken on a life and genre all its own in more recent years. A quick google images search for the term will return many unique interpretations of this simple knife and a lot of inspiration for aspiring knife makers.\n\nThis project is a great place to begin for anyone looking to get into knife making. It is challenging enough to be interesting, but simple enough to be doable and the finished product is a tool that is both useful and beautiful.\n\nThis instructable will walk through the basic steps needed to make a simple kiridashi from a metal file.

You are about to begin making a knife. Knives have a little bit of danger inherent to them. They\u2019re sharp when they\u2019re done. Sometimes they\u2019re sharp even before they\u2019re done. Please be careful handling the sharp piece of metal.\n\nAlso consider that at various points of this project, you will be heating the steel to roughly 1100-1300 degrees (that's literally red hot) then to around 500 degrees (still really hot). Hot things hurt if they\u2019re touched. Please use tongs and don\u2019t touch the hot piece of metal with any part of your body.\n\nLast but not least, there are power tools involved. Drills put holes in things, cutoff wheels and saws cut things, and sanders and grinders sand and grind things. None of those are practices that someone should be trying out on their own body so please don\u2019t hurt yourself with the spinning, whirring, grinding cutting things.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWX/66MF/JRQOQ98A/FWX66MFJRQOQ98A.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Cautions"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "For this project, you will need a few tools. Substitutions can be used in place of some of them, but using these keeps things relatively simple.

A bench grinder will also work, but will make it more difficult to get a consistent grind)\n- A Gas Torch (anything that will bring steel to a red heat will work, but having recently bought the MAPP gas torch in the picture, I have discovered that it is absolutely wonderful and everyone should have one. The best $60 I\u2019ve ever spent)\n- Tongs (long handled pliers will work as well)\n- A Cut Off Wheel (a sawzall with a metal blade or hacksaw will also work, but both will take a little longer)\n- A Drill (there\u2019s really no replacement for this. If you don\u2019t have one already, go buy yourself something nice: a drill)\n- A Set of Drill Bits (see comments regarding drill)\n- A Wire Drill Brush (this can theoretically be replaced with steel wool, but, again, will make things take longer)\n- Oil in which to quench (dunk) your piece during heat treatment (I use old motor oil, but you can also use vegetable oil, mineral oil, or even water)\n- Water to cool the knife during grinding\n\n\nMaterials:\n- A File (or another high carbon steel piece. It is important that your steel be high carbon or the finished knife will not hold an edge. Metal files are always high carbon tool steel. They have to be to file other metal. Because of this, they are a consistently safe material choice)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8J/N8GU/JRBBTGM8/F8JN8GUJRBBTGM8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZG/HBH7/JRBBTGM3/FZGHBH7JRBBTGM3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Tools and Materials"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Our first step is to normalize the file so we are able to cut and shape it. This is important because files are generally very hard since they are usually meant to cut and shape other things and are not, themselves meant to be cut or shaped. To normalize the steel, take the torch and heat it to red hot, then set it aside in a nice, non-flammable location and let it cool off on its own. This will remove the original heat treatment, but never fear, we\u2019ll be putting it back in a few steps. Do not dip the piece in water or anything else to speed up the cooling. That will defeat the purpose by immediately re-heat treating it. You can normalize the entire piece, or just sections. I chose to only do sections mainly because it was incredibly cold and I could not get the whole piece red hot at once.\n\nOnce the piece is normalized, you can cut your basic shape or blank. For my purposes, I removed the tang (long skinny handle part) of the file, and then cut the bar in half along a fairly sharp angle. This saves some shaping on the sander later and gives us a good indication of where our grind needs to go. A sharper angle will make a more traditional cutting edge while a flatter angle will provide more of a scraping or chiseling blade.

Use the sander or grinder to clean off any burrs that were left behind when we cut it and grind away excess material in areas where you want your handle to be more shapely. I typically like to grind a little finger grip into the handle to make it fit more nicely in the hand. Continue cleaning and shaping your knife until you are happy with how it looks. Make sure to move the blank around on the sanding belt, or you will wear away the grit on the belt or wheel and be left with a weird, striped sander or grinder.\nTo get a decent edge on your knife, line up the edge so it runs perpendicular to the edge of your sander or bench grinder. An optimal grind angle is 15-20 degrees. Kiridashi have what is called a chisel grind meaning they are ground mainly down one side. Hold the knife steady at your chosen angle and work at grinding away the material down toward the flat side. Because files have ridges, we will have to cheat just a little and also grind the other side down a small amount or the blade will have tiny, frail serrations in it. Work your grind down toward the flat side and once the tiny serrations start to appear, alternate between the sides until you are able to grind the serrations out. This will take a little patience and practice, but the material is pretty forgiving at this point. I recommend doing the grinding bare handed in order to tell when the piece is getting hot. Be careful not to let it get too hot or you will burn your fingers. When it warms up too much to be comfortable, cool it off in some water (or ice if your shop is frozen over like mine).\n\nTechnically, kiridashi come in left and right handed orientations depending on which side the grind is on. The knife in the pictures is left handed since the grind was made on the left side whereas one with the grind on the right side would be right handed. The reason for this is that, since these were originally used to mark wood for cuts, the woodworker would need to see where the mark was being made. With the grind on the same side as the hand, the woodworker can see where his mark is going. This orientation is something to consider while you are making the knife since you will most likely want it to suit your dominant hand.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUY/IBY7/JRBBTK30/FUYIBY7JRBBTK30.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIA/HOOH/JRBBTK3H/FIAHOOHJRBBTK3H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F49/T6LS/JRBBTK2I/F49T6LSJRBBTK2I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKQ/JYRP/JRQOQ7Z7/FKQJYRPJRQOQ7Z7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLZ/AR8Q/JRQOQ7ZD/FLZAR8QJRQOQ7ZD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKU/IXRN/JRBBTK4I/FKUIXRNJRBBTK4I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRP/8KA5/JRBBTK3Z/FRP8KA5JRBBTK3Z.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Shaping and Grinding"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "This step is optional, but if you want to drill holes to add any kind of handle material, a lanyard, or just feel like having a handle with holes in it, now is the time to drill them.

To do this, heat the edge to a dull red color and quench (dunk) in oil or water. If the color gets brighter, closer to orange, let it cool down a bit and then bring it back to dull red before quenching. This process of heating and quenching will make your knife\u2019s edge very hard, but also very brittle. If you were to strike the edge with a hammer, the steel would most likely break like glass.\n\nRemember our little talk about high carbon steel before? Here\u2019s why it\u2019s important. In as much as I understand it, steel behaves like this because there are crystalline structures present in the material caused by the interactions between the carbon and iron molecules that together make up steel. When steel is heated to red hot, these structures are fluid and in motion. When the steel is dipped in oil or water, it cools rapidly, causing the structures to crystallize within the steel making it very hard. The reason normalizing works is because the steel is heated, making the structures fluid, but since it is not cooled rapidly, the crystalline structures don\u2019t harden, and the steel stays soft.\n\nThere\u2019s actually a great series of instructables about all of this from this maker: https://www.instructables.com/member/takeitfromablacksmith/ if you want some more in depth information.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F88/9AIA/JRGOLEMB/F889AIAJRGOLEMB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWS/9EJD/JRGOLEMV/FWS9EJDJRGOLEMV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY0/KB2G/JRGOLENF/FY0KB2GJRGOLENF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9T/Z35V/JRGOLEQ0/F9TZ35VJRGOLEQ0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Heat Treatment"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "To take away a little of the brittleness in our blade, we have to temper it. To do this, first polish away a bit of the oil residue on the bevel that we ground into the blade earlier. Follow the same procedure, holding the knife at the chosen angle and cleaning away the oil so you have a nice shiny surface again. We need the blade to be shiny so that we can see the colors that are about to come into it.\n\nOnce your bevel is polished back up, use your torch to heat the knife\u2019s edge again. Don\u2019t put the blade directly in the flame this time or it will heat too fast, undoing the nice heat treatment we just did. Sort of kiss the back of the bevel, up away from the edge itself, taking your time and watching carefully for the colors to come in. They will start as a very faint yellow, then darken to a sort of darker straw yellow, and then move into a sort of purple color. When the transition from yellow to purple starts to happen, quench the knife again. Congratulations! You now have a fully heat treated knife.\n\nThere is some fascinating metallurgical reason why steel makes these colors but I don\u2019t know what it is. I do know that the yellow/purple color comes in at roughly 450-500 degrees meaning, if you don\u2019t want to risk ruining your initial heat treatment with the torch, you can do this step in just about any home oven.

This is done for multiple reasons. The first reason is that stabilization will help with moisture not being as much of an issue with the wood. The stabilization process removes the air from the wood pieces and replaces it with a heat activated resin. This makes the wood much less susceptible to damage due to moisture. This is very important in a duck call as they are used in a damp environment as well as while being blown into your breath has moisture. The second reason is due to the air being removed from the wood it greatly decreases the chance of air being drawn out from the wood during the epoxy curing process and causing bubbles.This is done by placing the wood into the resin inside a vacuum chamber. In this process in the video I used a wood hardener from minwax and while it did work I would advise using a proper stabilization resin. I suggest Cactus Juice it is a very effective stabilization resin. To stabilize the wood place the wood into the Cactus Juice make sure that the wood is completely submerged into the resin. Placing a weight on the wood might be necessary to keep the wood submerged during air removal process. This is best done entirely in the vacuum chamber. Once the wood is submerged place the lid onto the vacuum chamber and turn on the vacuum pump. Bubbles will start to rise out of the resin as the air is pulled from the wood. Allow the vacuum pump to run until there are no more bubbles coming from the wood. This could take several hours. If using Cactus Juice you will then turn off the vacuum pump and release the vacuum pressure and allow the wood to sit in the resin for a minimum of double the time it took to remove the air (example 2 hours to remove the air = 4 hours soaking). Now you will need to bake the wood at 200 degrees for 2.5 to 3 hours to harden the resin.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUF/V3KQ/JRQOJ986/FUFV3KQJRQOJ986.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Stabilize the Wood"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "While I usually make my call blanks using a cylindrical mold.

I first used the jointer to get one face and one edge completely flat. I then ran the board through the planer to get the other side flat. I can then use my flat edge along the table saw fence to get my other edge lined up with the first edge. If you do not have a way to mill lumber like this, (i didn\u2019t for a long time) you can purchase small pieces of wood online that is already prepared or you can but your wood from a planing mill that can get it ready for you so you just have to cut it up.

Also, try to stay outside your line just a little bit. You can sand it later on but it is better to have extra space to work with then cutting too much off.

Make sure you go slow and stay steady on this part. You really only have one chance at this part.\n*TIP -- Start your cut going with the grain. It is much easier to hide a glue seam going along the grain than one going against the grain. Check out the video to understand fully.\nAfter your inside drawer shape is cut out, you have to cut out the material to make your drawer.

MAIN BOX - For the outside part of the box, you will need to glue the seam back together from the cut you made earlier. Once this seam has dried, you can glue the back of the box back on to the main part. When all of the glued parts are dried, you should have a fully functioning box and drawer.

It is an easy and useful project, give it a try!\nWARNING: I used the metric system here, so the weights I am referring to are in grams (g).\nThis project started here:\nFor christmas, my girlfriend got a box with a set of plants (medicinal and aromatic) to make her own infusions. And with this set, there is a book of recipes, explaining the benefits of each recipe, the plants to add to the infusion, and their weights. But at the moment we had no weighing scale, and I challenged myself to find a solution.\nAnd I remembered this little letter weighing scale I got many years ago. It is very simple, with just 2 plastic parts and a clip, and it is quite useful to weigh letters.\nSo I decided to use a similar shape, and browsing on the internet I found the \"The International Society of Antique Scale Collector\" website , where you can see very nice pendulum scales. The model I made is similar to number 3, called \"Letter balance by N.B. Paris, markings indicate date 1869-1875\".\nBut the project does not stop to the reproduction of a pendulum scale. And the problem I faced was: How to calibrate it, without... another scale?

To do this, I wiped down the acrylic piece with a cloth to remove dust, I put it under the extractor fan in a well-ventilated room. I applied my first coat of the black spray paint. I allowed that to dry and applied my second layer making sure each layer was thin and covered the whole area. The strokes on the second layer were perpendicular to the first to get the best coverage. I applied 4 coats and allowed each to dry. Between drying times I designed the gears and arms on the computer. When creating the gear ratios I had to use trial and error to get the ratio as close to the real ratio as possible and used the toolbox to create the gears with a right number of teeth. Using smart dimension was very useful as I was allowed to create perfect measurements. All the gears were mated on SolidWorks with the correct ratios and worked together perfectly. This means the gears I had designed were perfect for the product as long as the friction on the pivots were at the minimum. I took the bearing sizes and central shaft into consideration and made the holes accordingly. I converted all of my gears to a 600mm by 300mm working drawing scaled 1:1. I ordered all the parts and saved it as a .dxf drawing. Then on techsoft, I imported the drawings from the .dxf file and did my final edits. I used the letter tool to number each gear. The first number represents which planet it moves from the outer planets to the inner planets. The second number represents the number in the gear train. On techsoft, all I had left to do was the numbering so this means I had fewer uncertainties when doing the measuring as the smart dimension tool is only on SolidWorks. I saved all my parts onto a USB and took it to the laptop for the laser cutter and got it cut out. Although creating the gears took over 2 hours, converting it to techsoft only took a few seconds. This was also true when doing the arms for each planet as this was created the same way on SolidWorks and converted to techsoft. When laser cutting the gears, the time taken for the total sheet to be cut was 41 minutes to do and the arms took 32 minutes to do. Although the arm file was smaller than the gear file, I cut the arms out on 9mm frosted acrylic while the gears were cut on 5mm black acrylic.\nAlternatives:\nThe gear would have been near impossible to do by hand, even with a template but this would have taken a huge amount of time and the accuracy needed would not be sufficient as a laser cutter has. The arms could have also been possible to do by hand but laser cutting them meant I could do a cool space design.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPQ/TNI8/JROTAPPB/FPQTNI8JROTAPPB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTW/AUFP/JROTAPPE/FTWAUFPJROTAPPE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7G/A3Q3/JROTAPPT/F7GA3Q3JROTAPPT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLO/88G3/JROTAPPV/FLO88G3JROTAPPV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F82/ETDV/JROTAPPC/F82ETDVJROTAPPC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUP/140D/JROTARTY/FUP140DJROTARTY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Laser Cutting the Gears"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Process:\nI made a Solidworks design to see how layering triangle pieces of 12mm MDF would go together and what the lengths for each triangle would be. I used these lengths to knock up another CAD design on techsoft for the laser cutter. The black lines were used to cut and these pieces were sent off to the laser cutter. Once this laser cutter cut the pieces, I used dowel and PVA glue to attach the pieces together. This was much easier as all I had left to do was sand all the edges down to the same angle to create a slope as I used the belt sander. This made this process much quicker and the mould was shaped within 2 hours. After this, I used a sanding block to curve the edges so it would be easier to sand cast and sandpaper with increasing grits to smooth down all the surfaces. After smooth, I applied a layer of varnish as it is resistant to moisture from the sand in sand casting and dried it with a blow dryer. I applied 2 more layers to each face and using high grit sandpaper, remove the paint brush marks.\nAlternatives:\nA good alternative would be 3D printing the base out of ABS and sanding down the edges to remove the plastic lines however this was not possible as our 3D printer at school did not print sizes of this magnitude.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F95/ULMM/JROTAR19/F95ULMMJROTAR19.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FND/0MQ9/JROTAR1B/FND0MQ9JROTAR1B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLO/88G3/JROTAPPV/FLO88G3JROTAPPV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F87/KIRS/JROTAR27/F87KIRSJROTAR27.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIA/EMHF/JROTAR28/FIAEMHFJROTAR28.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Creating a Mould for Sand Casting"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Process:\nTo make the aluminium base, I brought out the sandbox and the 2 halves of the sand holder. Firstly, I put the bottom half of the sand holder (the drag) upside down and then I put my base in the middle and sprinkled parting powder all over the bottom plank of wood and my base. Then I used a brush to make sure the parting powder was laid evenly. After that, I used a sieve to sprinkle sand a layer of sand on top of the mould and around the box. I compressed the top of the mould and around the edge with my fingers. After that, I had to carry on adding heaps of sand compressing it after every layer with a mallet by pounding it until the sand wouldn\u2019t move anymore. I carried on doing that until the sand was heaped over the top. Using a flat metal bar, I levelled off the sand in drag then slowly lifted it up (making sure no sand falls out (it shouldn\u2019t if the sand is compressed enough)) and flipped it over.Then I put the second half of the sand holder (the cope), stick the mould for the runner and riser near the base mould on opposite sides in the sand and sprinkle more parting powder on top. I brushed the parting powder evenly on the mould and the sand again. After this, I sprinkled and compressed more of the sand into the cope around. I carried on adding sand as well as pushing the sand together. After I had filled the drag and cope completely I took out the riser and runner, lifted the top and put it on its side on the side. After that I drilled a small pilot hole into the base making sure to keep my hand as steady as possible and tightened a long screw into the base, I pulled out the screw and the mould out together carefully and put it aside just in case a problem arose when pouring aluminium in and needing to restart this process again. I used a trowel to create a path from the motor holder mould cavity to the runner & riser holes and I used a paintbrush to take out loose sand and put the top half back on. The DT technician then poured molten aluminium into through the runner and into the cavity until you could see the aluminium come out on the other side in the riser. To finish off, we waited for it to cool (about 2 hours), took it out, cut off the excess aluminium with a hacksaw. To clean up the edges, I used emery cloth to smooth the edges a little bit and polished it with wet and dry paper to make it very smooth.\nAlternatives:\nInstead of sand casting the aluminium base, I could have used a CNC mill along with a large block of aluminium to get a smoother finished product however this would have lead to too much waste making it unsuitable for higher scaled of manufacture and the school doesn\u2019t actually have a CNC mill. Alternate materials include copper, brass or bronze for a cool golden or orangey colour however these metals have a very high melting point compared to aluminium.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9T/NUJM/JROTAR8P/F9TNUJMJROTAR8P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1K/4SOH/JROTAR9T/F1K4SOHJROTAR9T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA3/5P7B/JROTARAN/FA35P7BJROTARAN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBO/F6NB/JROTARB5/FBOF6NBJROTARB5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9C/P09O/JROTARC2/F9CP09OJROTARC2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP5/5SHP/JROTARHU/FP55SHPJROTARHU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE7/WLTB/JROTARN4/FE7WLTBJROTARN4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCA/N65U/JROTARN5/FCAN65UJROTARN5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKY/ZNKH/JROTARN7/FKYZNKHJROTARN7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F20/OHJY/JROTARRM/F20OHJYJROTARRM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Y/RKA2/JROTARRO/F8YRKA2JROTARRO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Sand Casting"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Process:\nWith my casted piece, the bottom was still very rough, to fix this, I put it in the milling machine table vice and secured it on the milling machine bed. I wound down the \u2018z-axis\u2019 handle to just above the piece and wound the \u2018x-axis\u2019 so the piece was to the right of the mill bit. I turned on the machine and turned the \u2018y-axis \u2018 wheel up and down to draw a line into the metal piece, I adjusted the \u2018x-axis\u2019 wheel for the next turn and went back and forth with the \u2018y-axis\u2019 handle. I repeated this process until I had gone over the whole top. I turned the \u2018z-axis\u2019 wheel one fraction of a turn and repeated the milling process and I did this until the whole bottom was level. When the base became level, this made it easier to belt sand the edges to the same correct angle as I did with the mould but this time to remove all the imperfections in the casting process.\nAfter this was done, all I had left was to mark out where the holes would be in the motor holder for the motor and the bar. To do this, I used a ruler and tri-square to bisect all the edges to find the centre, I had to do this on both sides as one side would hold the central shaft and the other side would have to enclose the motor. I scraped the lines on with a scribe and centre punched each intersection for the holes. I aligned the milling machine to the centre of the clamped casted piece and turned on the machine, I used a 20mm bit for a clearance hole for the motor and a 10mm bit for the central shaft. I wound the \u2018z-axis\u2019 wheel about 25 complete turns slowly to create a hole which was 25mm deep for the motor and about 15 complete turns for the central shaft. To connect these holes, I milled an 8mm hole for the spindle of the motor to go through safely.\nTo mill the flats for the connecting shafts, I put the full length of the steel bar into the collet and tightened that to the collet block, this was tightened to the table vice on the milling machine bed. Using the handles, the piece was moved to just touch the mill on the end and the handle on the \u2018x-axis\u2019 was set to zero, this ensured exactly 5 mm was cut from the end of the bar. I wound the \u2018z-axis\u2019 spindle down to be just above the curved surface, 5 mm in from the end. I turned on the milling machine and went back and forth on the \u2018y-axis\u2019 wheel and then turned the \u2018z-axis\u2019 handle 1 fraction, I repeated this process 5 times and turned off the milling machine, used a micrometre to check the thickness and then one of the gears with the flat holes to test it, if the bar did not fit in the hole, I milled down the flat in small increments to a point where the gear perfectly slid onto the bar. I took out the bar from the collet and cut off 15mm from the end with a hacksaw. With the cut piece with the flat on one side, I tighten the piece with the rough end facing out in the collet. I brought the mill to just touch the rough end and turned the machine on, I went back and forth in the \u2018y-axis\u2019 while adjusting the \u2018x-axis\u2019 in small amounts until this side was flat. I repeated the process of milling the flat on this piece and then did this whole process again eight times for each of the connecting pieces. To mill the long flat on the central shaft, I could not use a collet block so I used the table vice along with parallels to keep it level. However, the main process of milling the flat was identical as I went up in small amounts to the point where one of the gear holders fit. The process of milling the flats took 1 and a half hours while the process of milling the motor holder took 1 hour.\nAlternatives:\nFor the base, I could have done it completely by laser cutting layers of acrylic and attaching them together instead of casting then milling all the holes in the correct places. This may have been more useful for holding each part together as the laser cutter could account for the spaces however, the colour would not have a metallic theme or a flat edge in this way.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FD1/W1D0/JROTARYK/FD1W1D0JROTARYK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWI/N541/JROTARYL/FWIN541JROTARYL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6I/7YS2/JROTARYM/F6I7YS2JROTARYM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAR/AKGR/JROTARYN/FARAKGRJROTARYN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6Z/1P7R/JROTARYO/F6Z1P7RJROTARYO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCW/YXQL/JROTARYP/FCWYXQLJROTARYP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAR/R51J/JROTARYQ/FARR51JJROTARYQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ6/UQ29/JROTARYR/FJ6UQ29JROTARYR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F31/L1DK/JROTARYS/F31L1DKJROTARYS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT3/F4EU/JROTARYT/FT3F4EUJROTARYT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLR/1AL9/JROTARYU/FLR1AL9JROTARYU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Milling"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Process:\nFor the 8mm driving bar that goes through the central shaft with the flat on one end, I marked out the centre of the other end with a centre punch and ruler. I measured the spindle of the motor to find the size of the hole needed for the motor to fit into the driving bar. I put the bar into the lathe with the marked outside about 50mm away from the chuck of the main stock. On the tailstock, I tightened the drill chuck in with a 4mm drill bit. After this was all secure I turned the tailstock wheel to bring it closer to the steel bar and turned on the lathe. With my bar spinning, I wound the drill bit into the end of the bar up to 15mm and brought it back out. I put the motor spindle in the hole of the bar to check if the hole was perfect just in case and it was. Then, using a ruler and centre punch again, I marked out a hole for an M4 grub screw to go in to hold the motor in place. I put the bar in a V-block and secured the V-block to the table vice on the pillar drill. I put a 1/8th drill bit into the chuck of the pillar drill and tightened. The school did not have a 3.2mm drill bit for tapping M4 holes so this was the closest I could get. I turned on the pillar drill and drilled down straight into the bar to the point where I could see the bit in the hole created on the lathe directly before the bit got to the other side. I put the motor in and secured it with a grub screw in place.\nFor the legs, I laser cut the three legs using the same technique as before onto 8mm acrylic. I used a combination square to find the angle of each corner of the motor holder and used this to draw my design. After being laser cut, I used a permanent marker to colour the edge for the hole for connecting it to the base. After colouring the edge on the 3 pieces, I used a ruler, scribe and engineers square to work out the centre from the long side. After I marked the centre lines on all the pieces, I put my piece flat on a parallel bar and accounting for the thickness of the parallel and the middle of the width of the acrylic piece (4mm), I used a vernier height gauge to mark the middle of the leg. I put each piece in a vice and centre punched the cross section to get the exact middle of the hole. On the pillar drill table, I set up an angle plate with a G-clamp and then G-clamped the acrylic piece onto the angle plate. I centred this to the drill and tightened a 4mm drill bit into the chuck. I drilled a hole into each of my pieces and then numbered them. To mark out the hole into the motor holder for the legs, I cut about 15mm off a 4mm nail and hardened it to create a punch. To harden it, in the heat treatment area, I turned on the blow torch and heated the nail in a blue flame to cherry red. When the nail started to glow, the technician brought over a little pot of water and with long nose pliers, I picked up the piece and dropped it into the water to cool completely. I lined up a leg to one of the edges on the motor holder and put the punch in. With help from a teacher and the technician, One held the leg and base in place, the other held a scrap piece of metal bar on the punch and I hammered the bar to mark out a hole on the piece, I numbered the leg to the side and repeated for each side. I adjusted the angle of the table of the pillar drill and drilled 1/8th holes in each of the marked holes for the legs. I marked out holes for grub screws to hold the motor in place and drilled 1/8th holes here as well but with the table at 0\u00b0 for a hole parallel to the bottom of the base.\nAlternatives:\nI could have drilled a hole for the spindle with a pillar drill but that would have required a much longer time to set up for the same degree of accuracy as the lathe.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZR/O3R5/JROTASKU/FZRO3R5JROTASKU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6C/NKZJ/JROTASKV/F6CNKZJJROTASKV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJJ/3DE0/JROTASLN/FJJ3DE0JROTASLN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBE/U641/JROTASLO/FBEU641JROTASLO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPI/LD7R/JROTASLP/FPILD7RJROTASLP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYK/HGIS/JROTASLQ/FYKHGISJROTASLQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F91/PPYA/JROTASLR/F91PPYAJROTASLR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBV/GECN/JROTASLS/FBVGECNJROTASLS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F41/HSCQ/JROTASLU/F41HSCQJROTASLU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT1/O0XU/JROTASLV/FT1O0XUJROTASLV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Drilling"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Process:\nFor the holes I drilled into the base for the legs and to hold the motor up, I decided to tap the holes. For this, I started off with an M4 taper tap and tightened it into the tap wrench. I put the piece in a vice and made sure I was tapping perpendicular to the surface of the whole. To tap the holes, I turned the wrench in the hole 360\u00b0 clockwise and then 180\u00b0 back anticlockwise. I went back to remove the material out of the hole and forth to make the thread deeper. After I reached the end with the taper tap, I repeated the process with a plug tap to make the thread more defined and so the bolt screwed in tightly. I tapped all the holes I needed to on the base and the hole for the grub screw in the central spindle. After tapping these holes, I used an M4 bolt to check how strong the tap was and to make sure I had not taken away the thread by tapping in the same spot for too long.\nAfter this, I had to make small bolts that I could turn by hand to attach the legs to the base as there was not enough space to use a screwdriver with a regular bolt. To do this I tightened a 10mm diameter bar into the chuck of the metal lathe. I turned on the lathe and using the facing tool, I made the edge flat by turning the forward/back (y-axis) spindle all the way to through the face and back. Then, using the same tool, I turned the y-axis wheel back to the curved surface just touching it and turned the x-axis spindle 15mm down and back. I turned the y-axis wheel in another small increment and repeated the cut with the x-axis wheel. I repeated this process in small measurements to turn the bar down to 4mm in diameter so I could thread it and so it could go in the M4 hole I tapped. After turning the end down, I used a knurling bit to knurl 5mm inwards for the grip so I could tighten the bolt into the base. I took out the aluminium bar and cut off the end with a hacksaw then faced it back off with the lathe and the facing tool again. I repeated this process of creating the bolts 2 more times for each of the legs. For the brass arms, I cut the 5mm bars into each of the specific lengths with the hack saw and turned the ends down the same way with the lathe. Then using a countersink bit, I countersink the end and using a 2mm drill bit, I drilled into the end. The countersink end was to make it easier to hold the planet in place and the hole was so I could put an M2 bolt through the planet and the bar for making the glued joint stronger.\nThe next part was threading the knurled bolts and the brass bars for the planets. The brass bar was to be threaded to M5 and the knurled bolts were to be threaded to M4. The threading process is pretty much identical to the tapping process as it involves turning the wrench 360\u00b0 clockwise and then 180\u00b0 anticlockwise. I tightened the M5 die into the die stock and turned the non-countersunk end down to 20mm of the brass bar. I made sure to liberally use grease as brass was quite a stiff metal to thread. I checked the thread with a wing nut but realised the thread was too tight. I tightened the 2 other grub screws on the die stock to make the thread tighter and rethreaded the brass bars to make them a bit looser. I repeated this process with each of the brass bars and then the knurled bolts.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNN/F7DB/JROTASOO/FNNF7DBJROTASOO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWD/ZUIR/JROTASOP/FWDZUIRJROTASOP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1A/C2VU/JROTASOQ/F1AC2VUJROTASOQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYT/PUUE/JROTASOV/FYTPUUEJROTASOV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ1/AROY/JROTASOX/FQ1AROYJROTASOX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJS/8X68/JROTASPK/FJS8X68JROTASPK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHA/Q0SQ/JROTASPL/FHAQ0SQJROTASPL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Turning, Tapping & Threading"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Process:\nThis is one of the last steps I had left to do with my product. I had tapped each hole, I had laser cut each gear and cut the flats where I needed them. To start off, I made the outer gear branches first. To do this, I put one of the 3mm steel pieces with the flats into the centre of a 10mm outer diameter bearing. This bearing fit into the holder for each of the segments of the mechanism, I had 8 of these to do. Using the numbering system I laser engraved onto my gears, I put gears .2 and .3 on either end of flat bar sandwiching the holder in the middle- but not doing it too tight so the gears would spin freely. I used 2 part Araldite to glue the connecting shaft piece to the gears. I did this for each of them and left them overnight to cure.\nFor the planet, I put an M2 screw in the 2mm hole at the bottom of each planet and using Araldite, I cleanly glued on each of the planets onto the corresponding brass bar and allowed the glue to cure overnight. I removed excess glue with a toothpick and cloth along the side to ensure neatness before the glue was set properly.\nFor the circuit, I looked up on google how to wire a dpdt switch to reverse a motor and wired it according to the image. I made sure to order a motor to make sure that my power source did not need to be resisted for the motor so my circuit would be very simple. I wired a 12V adapter plug to the switch and connected that to the motor with crocodile clips. I checked the connection and turned the switch on to check the motor turned.\nFor the central shaft and the base, I again used Araldite to attach these two pieces together and left them to cure along with the outer gear pieces. For the inner gears, I glued .1 and .4 on either side of the planetary arm with Araldite with the 19mm bearing inside and an M10 nut and bolt to line them up and tighten them. The next day, after all these were cured, I started assembly, I pushed the first arm with the gear down all the way to the bottom. The bearing was tight on the central shaft so I had to cut out a piece of cardboard and put that on top of the arm before using a hammer and a scrap piece of pipe to mallet it down to the bottom. I then put the next outer gear mechanism and then the next planetary arm repeating this process over and over again up to the last arm. I attached the legs on with the previously made hand tightening bolts and put the motor in the 8mm steel driving shaft securing it with a grub screw. I used crocodile clips to wire the motor up and put that through the central shaft. On the flat of the driving shaft, I put the primary driving gear on and turned on the motor to see if all the gears turning.\nAfter securing the motor in the base with the 3 grub screws for that and turning on the motor, nothing moved. I took switched the motor off and took off the drive gear to turn the system by hand just to check where the problem would lie. I found that there was too much friction between the inner gears and the central shaft, this may have been because I laser cut the hole in the gears to 10mm and the aluminium bar was slightly bigger or the holes were not lined up correctly when glueing.\nThis was a huge problem. This meant I had to take it all apart and redo the central mechanism all over again. I pulled off the top gear and the subsequent arms and outer connections, but the gears glued to the bottom arms unstuck. I realised I could not use glue in my mechanism because it did not hold as well as it should have.\nInstead of trying to remove every part piece by piece, I salvaged all the parts I did not have to redo leaving only the arms with the gears stuck on the central shaft. I cut up the central shaft so I could take out the bearings and the arms and destroyed the central gears in the process. This meant I had to redo all the central gears and the central shaft again because these were not salvageable.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 9: The Assembly Part 1- the Fall"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "Process\nAfter the big failure, I started on fixing the gears, to do this I reopened my techsoft design and copied over the central gears to a new file. I increased the diameter of each hole by 0.25mm on all of the parts that were meant to be on the central shaft and put another hole with a 4mm diameter 15mm from the centre for each of the .1 gears and a hole of 3.25mm on each of the .4 gears. I laser cut the new gears out of the 5mm black acrylic used for the other gears. With the arms, I put the bearing in and put one of the new 0.1 gears on one of the sides (it didn't matter which side) and used an M10 nut and bolt to realign them. Put the arm on the machine vice of the pillar drill and drilled a 4mm hole into the arm with the same procedure as my previous step and then with a countersink bit I countersunk the 4mm hole on .1 gears. I tapped the hole 3.25 hole on the .4 gears with an M4 tap and put together the arm pieces with an M4 countersunk bolt. The larger diameter holes for the gears on the central shaft meant that only the bearing would be in contact with the central shaft reducing the friction here by a great amount. I also had to redo the central shaft, to do this, I repeated the milling process on a 10mm bar cut to the correct length with a hacksaw. This process was identical to the milling process described in the previous slides and I glued that to the base with Araldite again after removing the old piece.\nI found another problem after doing this. After doing the milling process, the central shaft dented with little notches on the inside so there was resistance with drive bar. To fix this, I put the drive shaft into a hand drill and covered it with diamond lapping paste. I put the base and the central bar upright in a table vice and using the hand drill, I drilled down the diameters of the two shafts so the both became frictionless. The internal diameter of the central shaft increased and the diameter of the drive shaft decreased so there would be less contact. I went through a couple of times to make it perfect and cleaned out all the waste and diamond compound left with a cloth.\nI also decided to create 1mm spacers out of HIPS to make sure that the arms were slightly raised above the outer gears so they did not collide. I drew these washers on techsoft and laser cut them as well making sure the internal diameter was 11mm so it did not cause friction with the central shaft. After this, I was ready to rebuild. I resecured the motor onto the drive shaft with a grub screw and then secured motor into the base with the further 3 grub screws. I reattached the legs onto the base in the correct place with the hand tightening bolts. I stacked the first arm with the gear, it slid on tightly but perfectly only on the bearing so it turned freely and I didn\u2019t have to tap that down into place.\nTo connect to gear 1.1, I pushed down the outer gear connection with gear 1.2 at the bottom and 1.3 at the top. I pushed down Uranus\u2019s arm and repeated with 2.2 gear connection downwards. I made sure to put a washer in between each component. I repeated this process all the way to 8.3 at the top making sure there was no resistance turning the arms all the way along. I put the 8.4 drive gear onto the flat of the drive shaft and wired up my circuit with crocodile wires. I connected the planets bars with the arms with bolts on either side of the threaded part and mounted the sun at the top. I flicked the switch, it worked! There were still a couple of problems so the motor periodically slowed down and sped up but this was fixed by spraying down the gears and the shaft with silicone grease. I flicked the switch the opposite direction and the planets turned anticlockwise as well. This was a proud moment.\nI then focused on the circuit. For this, instead of the crocodile clips, I replaced them with wires and spade connectors for the switch and soldering on the motor. For the spade connectors, I stripped the wires and twisted the ends, put them into the spade connectors and using a crimping tool on the red bit. I slid the connectors onto the switch. For soldering, I heated the soldering iron up and melted some solder on the end, I looped the wire into the hole of one of the terminals of the motor and applied the solder. I repeated this for the other terminal also. To connect with the power source, all I had to do was tighten the wire in with the screw. I will show the diagram on the next page.

I took care to ensure the lathe speed was reduced to avoid overheating the blank.\nOnce the blanks were drilled I scuffed the pen kit tubes to give the glue something to grip onto and glued the tubes into the blanks.\nI then used my disk sander to sand the blanks flush to the tubes.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FE5/VMQT/JRKZ3N4H/FE5VMQTJRKZ3N4H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7F/VHS8/JRKZ3N79/F7FVHS8JRKZ3N79.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTS/455D/JRKZ3N6A/FTS455DJRKZ3N6A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAN/PDUM/JRKZ2VX8/FANPDUMJRKZ2VX8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFZ/8GB0/JRKZ3SOA/FFZ8GB0JRKZ3SOA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUC/LM3B/JRKZ3N4J/FUCLM3BJRKZ3N4J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5R/432P/JRKZ3N4L/F5R432PJRKZ3N4L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM6/TQ5H/JRKZ3TBJ/FM6TQ5HJRKZ3TBJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA2/37CI/JRKZ3N5L/FA237CIJRKZ3N5L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQT/MVQZ/JRKZ3N5G/FQTMVQZJRKZ3N5G.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Make Some Holes and Glue Some Tubes"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "So, for anyone who kinda likes having a peek at things as there developing this is the best bit.\nI had an idea of what the finished product would look like but not entirely. As I turned I impatiently wanted to see what the blank would look like once finished, to do this I sprayed some fast drying finish and I was very happy with what I saw.\n\nI mounted the blanks onto my pen mandrel with there appropriate bushings. (bushings hold the parts in place and give me a good mark to aim for when turning resulting in more accurate pen parts)\n\nThough you can turn the hole pen at once I find that mandrels develop inaccuracies over time and the further from the live center you turn the greater the chances of error occurring are. this is why I personally reduce the length of my mandrels and only turn one part at a time. In fact, I tend to do one half before turning the part and finishing the other half. (this is potentially odd behavior for a pen maker as others could prioritize speed - I prioritize a good product)\n\nI used a very shart gouge to turn these blanks and still got a small tear out I fixed this by using super glue and some of the swarth previously taken off the blank to create fresh plastic which turned with similar properties to the resin.\n\nMy technique when turning these parts is to \"rub the bevel\" meaning I approach a cut with the part of the tool that doesn't cut and slowly introduces the cutting surface. this results in the finest possible cut and a much-reduced possibility of tear out.\n\nonce I was as close as I could be to my final shape I sanded through grits. (there is a myth that if you are using an aggressive grit as the sandpaper starts to clog that it acts as a less aggressive grit sandpaper. This is false. it is much easier to have a selection of different sandpapers and work your way up to higher numbers. You will get much better results with a lot less effort)\n\nOnce I was happy I added a coat of melamine lacquer and burnished to a highish gloss.\n\nI also cleaned the inside of the tubes, No one wants a mucky pen.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAQ/7PNC/JRKZ3TK6/FAQ7PNCJRKZ3TK6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9G/VVU0/JRKZ3TG8/F9GVVU0JRKZ3TG8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAA/IQ5A/JRKZ3TSC/FAAIQ5AJRKZ3TSC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOM/NKHJ/JRKZ3U6Q/FOMNKHJJRKZ3U6Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F66/7JC8/JRKZ3THE/F667JC8JRKZ3THE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5L/CWM8/JRKZ3U5Q/F5LCWM8JRKZ3U5Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVC/PPQH/JRKZ3TIR/FVCPPQHJRKZ3TIR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7N/R77H/JRKZ3U4Y/F7NR77HJRKZ3U4Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPF/H0R2/JRKZ3TNP/FPFH0R2JRKZ3TNP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGE/RBRJ/JRKZ3TQB/FGERBRJJRKZ3TQB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFD/CY11/JRKZ3U3B/FFDCY11JRKZ3U3B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBD/LO89/JRKZ2VSY/FBDLO89JRKZ2VSY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYF/JFZY/JRKZ3U1N/FYFJFZYJRKZ3U1N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4P/TZU0/JRKZ3TUZ/F4PTZU0JRKZ3TUZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOO/4WKT/JRKZ3TZM/FOO4WKTJRKZ3TZM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Shape Up"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "There are pen presses on the market.

Some quick thought was given to dimensions - both the overall and relative flavors. 6\" x 9\" for the exposed valet storage space tickled my fancy and since I'm using 1/2\" stock, that meant 5\" x 8\" outside dimensions for the hidden box.\nNote: I'll add all my dimensions in the last step of this Instructable, for those interested in the minute details.\n\nI started by ripping some 1/2\" plywood into 2\" wide strips. These are wider than I need, but I'll trim the box to final height after it's built. The box sides were cut using a small parts cross cut sled and stop block on the table saw. Rabbets were cut on each end of the long sides (to accept the sides), as well as the bottom edge of all four sides (to accept the bottom).\n\nThe rabbets provide a level of auto alignment, which simplifies assembly. Glue was applied to every rabbet, the sides tacked together with pin nails, and then the hardboard bottom dropped in place. I ran packing tape around the perimeter of the box for a bit of clamping pressing and a small weight pressed the bottom tightly into it's rabbet.\n\nFor the bottom lining of this box, I used 1/8\" EVA foam. A specifically shaped pocket was then cut into a layer of 1/2\" EVA foam. Your storage needs may vary and alternate options could be felt, leather, flocking, nothing, etc.\n\nWith my item in place, I was able to determine how far I could reduce the height, and removal was done using the table saw, followed by a few light passes through the drum sander.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSX/Y5S3/JRETXSPZ/FSXY5S3JRETXSPZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC4/JAFM/JRETXSQ6/FC4JAFMJRETXSQ6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4A/AVDD/JRETXSQR/F4AAVDDJRETXSQR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRH/TONJ/JRETXSQ2/FRHTONJJRETXSQ2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5J/8KSP/JRETXSTO/F5J8KSPJRETXSTO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEB/MRSV/JRETXSVN/FEBMRSVJRETXSVN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4H/LYFL/JRETXSVO/F4HLYFLJRETXSVO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSH/3E80/JRETXT0N/FSH3E80JRETXT0N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGN/9V27/JRETXT88/FGN9V27JRETXT88.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Internal Box Fabrication"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "It's worth mentioning that I reapplied a layer of packing tape to the sides and top of internal box, which will act as a shim while building the outside box. I want a tight, slip fit, but not an immovable plug.\n\nFor the outside box, I used a poplar 1\" x 6\", and the first step was to thickness it to 1/2\", which was achieved using the drum sander. The board was then ripped into two equal sections (2 5/8\") - again wider than necessary. Each section will become one long side and one short side.\n\nWith the table saw blade dialed in at 45 degrees, I used my small parts miter sled to make all the angled cuts. I used the internal box to mark lengths - sneaking up on the cuts as necessary.\n1. Cut the initial miter [Fig. 5].\n2. Place the stock against the long face of the internal box to mark the cut line.\n3. Cut the stock a bit heavy, so as not to over cut and trim until the fit was perfect.\n4. Use this piece and a stop block to cut the matching/opposing side.\n5. Clamp a finished long piece to the internal box, so you can repeat the process for the short sides [Fig. 6].\nNote: It's a good idea to label your parts, so you can keep them in order during assembly - especially if you have continuous grain wrapping around the sides [Fig. 7].\n\nTo determine the placement of the bottom, I used the internal box, the bottom stock (3/16\" hardboard), and my phone case. I left a little extra at the bottom for sanding/truing, got the measurement, and cut the grooves on the table saw. Since the hardboard is 3/16\" thick and the blade kerf is 1/8\", I took one pass on all the parts, nudged the fence, and made a second pass. The side were then used to determine the size of the hardboard panel - place it in the grooves, make a mark, adjust the table saw fence, and make the cut - no tape measure needed.\n\nMuch like rabbets on the first box, the grooves and bottom panel with help auto align this box during assembly. The miters are end grain, which tends to soak up glue, so I apply it in two stages - first miter coat, glue in the grooves, second miter coat.\n\nAssembly is just a matter of locking the sides onto the bottom panel and ensuring the corners all close up nicely. Packing tape was again used for clamping pressure. I don't think it was necessary,but I used the internal box as a means of keeping the sides square.\nNote: The packing tape shim pulled double duty by ensure no glue squeeze out would lock the boxes together for eternity.\n\nOnce the glue was cured, I used the drum sander to flush up the two box bottoms, as well as flatten the top edge.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1W/4W1U/JRGOH38N/F1W4W1UJRGOH38N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRA/YGBG/JRETXTCW/FRAYGBGJRETXTCW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMW/B44B/JRETXTE5/FMWB44BJRETXTE5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKO/JZWU/JRETXTF8/FKOJZWUJRETXTF8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F86/5DO8/JRETXTGC/F865DO8JRETXTGC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F80/WDD3/JRETXTGE/F80WDD3JRETXTGE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8M/4PVI/JRETXTHM/F8M4PVIJRETXTHM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL2/BCO6/JRETXTJC/FL2BCO6JRETXTJC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYS/ZB01/JRETXTMQ/FYSZB01JRETXTMQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSI/NQS1/JRETXTMR/FSINQS1JRETXTMR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYY/M9WZ/JRETXTNZ/FYYM9WZJRETXTNZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOP/ZIH9/JRETXTOK/FOPZIH9JRETXTOK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI8/Y2NT/JRETXTP8/FI8Y2NTJRETXTP8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAY/S4LV/JRETXTUP/FAYS4LVJRETXTUP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLM/7M61/JRETXTNE/FLM7M61JRETXTNE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: External Box Fabrication"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "In order to cut the dovetail slots using the router table, I made a small sled from shop scraps.

I also had to add a spacer to get the box into the cutting field.

In fact, the hardest part was deciding on which wood to use. I narrowed it down to my dwindling supply of pallet padauk, but still had to choose between the orange/red heart wood and the spalted sap wood. In the end, I decided to save the cool spalted wood for some future project using darker wood.\n\nI ran test cuts with poplar to figure out my process, as well as determine the size of stock with which I'd need to start (11/16\" width x \" height x 18\" length). My supply of pallet padauk is drying up and I don't want to waste more than absolutely necessary.\n\nSide 1 - The Quick Side\nSet the fence so that your work piece makes full contact with the cutting edge. If you end up with a flat area at the bottom of the work piece, the fence is too far back [Fig 5]. If that's the case, just move it forward and take another pass until you get a crisp bottom angle [Fig. 6].\n\nSide 2 - The Precision Side\nMove the fence back more than the width of the desired finish key. Don't even try to get a perfect cut out of the gate - messing up isn't worth the risk. Just take a pass, test the fit with your box, nudge the fence forward, take another cutting pass, test the fit. Repeat until you get a nice snug fit.\nNote: I milled both a test piece and finish piece for each step, so that any mistake occurred on the sacrificial stock. I'd cut a length of poplar and test the fit on the box. As long as the cut didn't remove too much material, I'd make the same cut on the Padauk and then adjust my fence. If the fit was too loose, I just saved myself a lot of frustration.\n\nWith the key stock slab finished, it's just a matter of slicing it into individual keys. Again, I'm not going for a perfect fit. I'd rather have extra that can be trimmed and flushed up to the box once the glue dries. I decided on 1 1/4\" lengths and made the cuts at the bandsaw using a sled.\nNote: Before slicing and dicing, I cut off the unused portion of the paduak board to live on in the scrap bin and future projects - waste not, want not.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJG/YYUQ/JRGOLG8Z/FJGYYUQJRGOLG8Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKE/7Q7X/JRGOOAZQ/FKE7Q7XJRGOOAZQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2P/J0CV/JRGOOB05/F2PJ0CVJRGOOB05.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIV/X1LP/JRGOOB0Q/FIVX1LPJRGOOB0Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY6/KMY4/JRGOOB1I/FY6KMY4JRGOOB1I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSV/LGLV/JRGOOB29/FSVLGLVJRGOOB29.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGY/WUR5/JRGOOB2I/FGYWUR5JRGOOB2I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVM/RP9F/JRGOOB2Q/FVMRP9FJRGOOB2Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT9/X5T1/JRKYZU24/FT9X5T1JRKYZU24.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP3/Z62F/JRKYZU23/FP3Z62FJRKYZU23.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Cutting Dovetail Key Stock"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Glue up is easy, but I took a minute to prepare for the operation because I know my brain ... it likes to throw wrenches. One of these keys will be a sliding lock, so we don't want to glue it in place. One could simply set one of the eight to the side and carry on with business, but not me. My mischievous gray matter would wait until I'm distracted ... probably singing along to the freshest K-Pop track ... and BOOM - I'd spread glue in all eight key slots. Not this time, man in gray ... I taped over the slot.\n\nSpread/brush glue into one of remaining seven slots, spread/brush glue onto one of the seven keys, slide the key into a non-taped slot, repeat six more times, queue up a K-Pop playlist and wait for that glue to dry.\n\nTo trim the excess key stock, you could use a flush cut hand - otherwise known as a pull saw. I find this to be inconvenient and prone to mistakes, so I usually opt for the bandsaw. However, my bandsaw suffers from chronic drift and chatter, so I now prefer to use the table saw. A low profile spacer fence solves the problem of the protruding keys not being able to register against the fence [Fig. 6]. With a high tooth blade and accurate fence setting, you can get flush cuts that require minimal sanding.\nNote: If you aren't comfortable with this type of cut, you could clamp the box to a sled - as long as your blade height is able to accommodate both the sled and box.\nBandsaw method example can be seen in The 2 Player Shut The Box Game Instructable.\n\nMost of the smoothing work was done by the table saw and/or drum sander, but I did finish sand both boxes with 150 and then 220 grit sandpaper. The locking key was finessed independently because it kept moving and I didn't want to nick up the edges. I'd just drag each side across 100 grit sand paper a few times, test the fit, and repeat until almost flush [Fig. 10]. The final flushing and smoothing passes were made with the key installed and I found that pressing a piece of wood against the adjacent edge was enough to keep it from moving [Fig. 11]. A tack cloth was used to remove all the dust.\nTip: I recommend hand sanding with the grain. The orbital sander tends to drive the fine paduck dust down into the pores of the poplar, which results in a blotchy pink hue.

Instead, I nested the boxes and used a pencil to mark the area to be notched. I made the cut on the table saw since I have a sled to do so, but it could also be done on the router. I generally find the table saw to have more control and I really didn't want to risk any plywood blowout or other possible mistakes at this point. I did a few test fits with a 1/4\" dowel and refined/enlarged the cut as necessary.\n\nLayout\nTo accurately mark the hole location in the sliding key, I just used a 1/4\" brad tip drill bit. Once I obsessed over its \"perfectly centered placement,\" I pressed it into the key to leave an impression. I then used the drill press to bore the hole, using the cutting sled to hold the key perpendicular to the quill.\n\nPeg\nI started with a random length of 1/4\" dowel, inserted it into the key hole, and marked the desired cut length, which was made using the bandsaw sled.

I made them. The idea I had was to make dog paws and as the idea evolved personalizing them with all of our past and present pets became a part of it.\nMaking the mold started with a wooden form \"plug\" of what I envisioned the final step to look like, The diameter is 17 1/2\" and thickness is 2\". The paw pads are raised 1/2\". The edges of pads and outside 17\" diameter require a slight taper so they don't stick in the final mold. The wood plug was painted with latex paint to act as a separator when laying up the fiberglass mold.\nThe fiberglass cloth is cut to lay flat around the plug. Polyester resin is brushed into the cloth to saturate it. This process is not technical all you are trying to do is cover the plug and build bulk. Regular fiberglass woven cloth or fiberglass mat can be used. The final thickness of the mold is greater than 1/4 inch. I did the layup in 4 stages to get the final thickness. An air release hole is drilled into the mold between the \u201dpads\u201d and threaded to accept an air hose fitting.\nTo add the name I used Photoshop to layout the name into the center paw pad. With the sheet printed the letters are lightly sprayed with 3M 77 spray adhesive then stuck onto the paper in their respective places. The sheet is cut out around the center pad. Spray the letters that are mounted on the sheet, clean the mold where the letters will go with acetone. Align the cut out sheet into the mold and press the letters so they stick onto the mold. Roll the paper away so not to disturb the letters position. Add scotch tape over the air release hole in the mold.\nTo prepare the fiberglass mold for the concrete grease it with a lithium auto grease and a rag several times for the first pour. On subsequent pours just clean it out and re-grease. Be careful around the letters to not have grease build up on the edges but be sure they are covered.\nTo get the smooth surface for the \u201cpads\u201d I used a mortar mix (no rocks) and added a little cement. The tint was added to give a tan color. This mixed concrete mix is added to the pad areas slowly and worked into the corners so there are no air bubbles in the finished part. After the pads but before the body pour I bounced the mold on the workbench for several minutes to work the air bubbles to the surface (bottom, because the mold is inverted) The next \u201cbody\u201d mix of concrete is poured in and worked into the mold against the walls. When that is all in again bounce the mold to raise the air bubbles.\nThe mold then sits with a table fan blowing across the top, (actually the bottom when finished). Because the concrete is poured into a fiberglass mold it will not cure fast since the only place for the water to evaporate out is on the top. At about 5 hours, depending on room temperature, it is cured enough to radius the bottom edge smoothing a radius into the concrete helps stop cracking and easier on the hands when carrying. 48 hours after pouring the stone can be removed from the mold. Turn mold upside down, support the stone so it doesn\u2019t fall to the table and insert an airline into the back of the mold, in a few minutes the mold will release from the stone. Allow the stone to sit with the fan blowing on it another 24 hours. Any time after another 48 hours the latex paint can be applied.\nI did the mix ratios in metric because my scale had it and it was easier and more precise than pounds and ounces.\nMix ratio for tint, 100 mL tint / 3100 mL water = 3200 mL tinted water\nFor \u201cPAW PADS\u201d;\n2 kilograms mortar mix\n268 grams cement\n473 milliliters tinted water\nFor BODY MIX;\n13.6 kilograms concrete mix\n1.9 liters water", "title": "Dog Paws Stepping Stones", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Dog-Paws-Stepping-Stones/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The plug was made from left over wood, the raised pads are \u00bd\u201d tall and slightly tapered on the sides, \u201cdraft\u201d.

You can always add more complicated elements later.\nThis is a fun family build. The kids can help drill holes, drive screws, hammer in t-nuts, and paint.\nBe safe\nAny construction project can be dangerous or fatal, so please take appropriate safety precautions and consult a professional when you need help.\nAlways wear safety glasses. I also recommend hearing protection and a respirator when the situation calls for it.\nClimbing can also be dangerous. Make sure the users of the wall know how to keep safe and that the area is clear of hazards. The REI article says it well:\nThe area underneath and around your wall must be made safe for falling. Ensure that this area is free of any objects that you could hit or land on in a fall. Never boulder over unpadded concrete, asphalt, wood, or any other hard surface. Falls directly onto an unprotected surface can result in serious head injury or even death. ...\nThere are several options for padding your fall zone including commercially available bouldering pads, old mattresses, or several layers of carpet padding. However you choose to prepare your fall zone, you must take the responsibility of making it safe very seriously. Artificial climbing holds regularly spin or break, resulting in violent, out-of-control falls. You must never put yourself or others in a position that could result in injury in the case of an unexpected fall.\nI am not a professional, and I am just sharing my experience for information and entertainment purposes.

We have to print a lot in different DIN formats. From time to time these paper rolls are empty. What is left are strong Cardboard Tubes. Some of them are used as Mailing Tubes and the rest is stored next to my office before they are thrown away.\nI see these tubes every single day and I often think \"These tubes are so cool and just too good to be thrown away\". Now it is the time to use them. I saved them in my office and brought them home.\nStory 2:\nMy kids have a huge collection of Lego bricks. And on every birthday and Christmas is getting more and more. At the moment the Lego is \"stored\" in a huge box. If you want to build something new, you have to search for it. Maybe you find the right brick, maybe not. So it would be cool to create a storage system for the most needed bricks.\nStory 3:\nAs you maybe know, I'm a huge cardboard fan. I recently created two projects (Card Feeder and Card Sorter).\nTo cut a long story short, I want to combine the three stories and create a cabinet with drawers out of Cardboard Tubes. As I said before, I had access to some tubes, but sadly these are not enough. I needed at around 17m of tubes during this project.

Because I want to get more familiar with 3D Printing, I decided to create the Jigs in Fusion360 and print them out.\nTubeDrillJig\nThe 1st Jig is a simple piece to hold the Cardboard Tube in place. I used it also to mark the holes for the Drill Station.\nI created a simple square 75 x 75 x 17,5mm with a 64mm hole in the middle (the diameter of my Cardboard Tubes). With a construction layer I cut the whole block in half and printed them twice on my Wanhao Duplicator i3.\nTubeSawJig\nMiter cuts on round objects are very tricky. If they rotate just a bit during sawing or during repositioning, the edges will not fit together. So it is very important, that they stay in the same position during the whole sawing process.\nThe 2nd Jig is based on the first one. 75 x 75 x 10mm, with a 65mm hole in the middle. I created a small 2mm gap and two hooks on the right side. With that mechanism and two rubber bands I can clamp down the tube.

Because I don't know how to draw different things in 3D, I switched very soon to Fusion360. Here it is much easier for me to create the first prototypes and ideas.\nI created a 455mm tube with 60mm inside and 64mm outside diameter. I copied, rotated and moved this tube 7 times and so created the left shape.\nThe cabinet base is created from two tubes in an 90\u00b0 angle to the side. The right side of the cabinet is a copy of the left side (8 tubes).\nTo create the top of the cabinet, I copied the bottom tubes to the top and inserted 5 more.\nI created 6x M6 threaded rods\n4 from top to bottom, 2 one each side, 600mm\n2 in the top, from back to front, 400mm\nand secured them with M6 hex nuts. This is the main mechanism to hold everything together. The rods are placed at 32mm from the edge of the tube.\nI decided to close all the tubes with cardboard circles. 3mm thick and 64mm in diameter.\nAfter the basic shape was finished, I worked on the drawers. I used 4 tubes (64mm diameter) with miter cuts. 435mm for the long sides and 340mm for the short ones. On the bottom of the tube rectangle is a 3mm slot.

I did the same on the other end of the tube.\nAfter I marked all tubes, I put them on my drill station. Because I had to drill a lot of holes with the same settings, I created another jig. It is a construction out of two vices and a piece of scrap wood. I mounted all of them on my machine vise on the drill station.

One disadvantage of using lock nuts is that you can not rotate it with your hands. You need wrenches.\nI used my drill to avoid this problem. I clamped one end of the threaded rod into the drill chuck. With that mechanism I could rotate it via drill. On the other side I used a wrench.

Last thing you want is to call something 'safe and secure' only to have it fail you.\nSo at the design stage I did the following calculations: The bin is 38x51x30cm, or about 58 litres when full.\nFrom the USDA website: \"Bulk density is dependent on soil organic matter, soil texture, the density of soil mineral (sand, silt, and clay) and their packing arrangement. As a rule of thumb, most rocks have a density of 2.65 g/cm3 so ideally, a silt loam soil has 50% pore space and a bulk density of 1.33 g/cm3.\"\nSo, assuming 1/3 rock and 2/3 soil, the average density is about 1.77 g/cm3 or 1.77 kg/litre. So the overall weight of this planter base is 1.77 x 58 = 102.66 kg\nGiven a base of 38cm, vs a height of 80cm, this planter should be able to withstand a lateral tipping force of about 24kg applied at the top.\nMy kid is only 15 kg at the moment, so there is a pretty good factor of safety. Furthermore, the planter base itself prevents the kid from getting too close to the fence anyhow. Finally, this is really just a deterrent and a physical reminder for the kid to not run onto the driveway. It's still our responsibility as parents to teach him basic safety and keep an eye out for grave danger!\nSummary: This has been tried and tested for over a year and it works.

It has a maple split top (Roubo) which is what many advanced woodworkers are using. It uses inexpensive vises but is designed to accept the more expensive hardware should you chose to upgrade.\nThe only \"downsides\" to this bench would be the difficulty with adding a Benchcrafted tail vise (would need a longer top) and it uses round dogs instead of square dogs.

The plate has 2 6mm holes for the bolts to go through.\nI cut a second plate and 4 spacers, these follow the shape of the hole in the plate but leave a space for the cable and space for the bolts to go through the holes and be tightened underneath with nuts.\nUsing the 2 bolts I assembled the bulb holder as follows.\nGlue the 4 spacers together so that there is a clear gap for the cable, then glue this to the underside of one of the plates.\nFeed the bulb holder through the base plate and the single top plate then screw the ring on and use a couple of dots of superglue to fix the top plate to the ring.\nFeed the bolts through the plate and secure them underneath with nuts. Add a nut to the ends of each bolt and screw them approximately 8mm. Feed the nuts through the holes of the base plate and secure underneath with 2 nuts. screw or unscrew the 2nd layer of nuts to tighten the base plate between the 2 sets of nuts.\nFinally, with the cable fed under the plate and through the gap in the spacers, glue the base plate to the bottom of the lamp shade.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSJ/QGPR/JRGOF792/FSJQGPRJRGOF792.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOC/T2O6/JRGOF79D/FOCT2O6JRGOF79D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRC/M1O3/JRGOF77W/FRCM1O3JRGOF77W.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Bulb Holder"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I wanted to assign a colour to each unique shape, but I didn't have quite enough colours.

I don\u2019t recommend using copper for this application as yes it may be a more durable solution but it could corrode in the long run and easily be pinch or kinked while pushing the refrigerator back in place and for what we are doing here, plastic works fine. Another good alternative would be to use a braided stainless steel line, but they are double the price.\nWhenever installing plastic pipe with compression fittings such as these, you always want to use plastic ferrules. The ferrule, AKA sleeve or olive, is the part the compresses on to the pipe which makes for a leak free joint. If you use a brass ferrule, you run the chance of it cutting thru the pipe and causing the fitting to leak, this is where most DIYers make a mistake that could potentially lead to a disaster.\nAnother thing to keep in mind is using a brass sleeve inside the pipe. If you don\u2019t insert one before tightening, the pipe will collapse onto itself and could also cause water damage due to it not being installed correctly. The sleeve acts as a reinforcement to make sure the pipe isn\u2019t squashed during the tightening process.\nIf you don\u2019t feel comfortable using compression fittings, there\u2019s a much more user-friendly alternative that\u2019s available and it\u2019s called a push-fitting. These push fittings are easy to use and do the job just fine, but if you\u2019re looking for a more durable option I suggest using compression fittings.\nTo be able to connect the line from the refrigerator to your closest cold water supply line, you\u2019ll either need a push fitting, or a dedicated Tee with a sweat on valve (1/2\" male sweat shut-off valve). I\u2019ll be showing both ways to install one as you may not be familiar with sweating copper pipe. However, if you feel like trying it out, I do suggest watching this video right here as it gives easy step-by-step instructions on how to properly solder a copper pipe. In any case, don\u2019t ever use THIS type of valve. The last valves you see are called saddle valves and use a clamp type system that clamp\u2019s onto a pipe with 2 screws and uses a small needle to puncture it, giving water to whatever it\u2019s connected to. However, these have a tendency to leak from the rubber joint after a while and are an accident waiting to happen, so I suggest you stay away from them even if they are tempting.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FT0/SYFB/JQWT4CFA/FT0SYFBJQWT4CFA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGT/22KM/JQWT4CK3/FGT22KMJQWT4CK3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCO/HK5G/JQWT4CT0/FCOHK5GJQWT4CT0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSU/G1TP/JQWT4CM4/FSUG1TPJQWT4CM4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL8/YAAF/JQWT4COI/FL8YAAFJQWT4COI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXZ/ALE0/JQWT4CX5/FXZALE0JQWT4CX5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUW/QVDQ/JQWT4FFC/FUWQVDQJQWT4FFC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQY/4J35/JQWT4D54/FQY4J35JQWT4D54.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZF/CS4P/JQWT4DB0/FZFCS4PJQWT4DB0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2W/CACK/JQWT4DAZ/F2WCACKJQWT4DAZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Materials"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Now onto the tools.

If you don\u2019t have this kind of setup, you might wanna use another route such as running it thru your cabinets and connecting to your sink\u2019s cold water line. If this is the case, you might not need to shut off the main water valve to the house to install your tap. Most under counter setups have shutoff valves for the sink which should be located here, I have a different setup so this won\u2019t work for me, but, if you do have a valve, you could shut it off and make your connection right over it just like this.\nBut since I\u2019m tapping into the line in my basement, let\u2019s shut off the main water valve and drip the system out by the lowest point in the house and the lowest point in my house is my exterior hydrant.

Installing a push fitting like this is super easy but there are some steps to follow in order to make a proper connection. Sharkbites require that the outside of the pipe is deburred before insertion. You could either use your Sharkbite deburring tool or just a flat file. The outside burr, if not filed down, could damage the o-ring inside the fitting and cause it to leak seeing it\u2019s sharp. At this stage, I always like deburring the inside of the pipe as well to prevent turbulence and restriction. Something else to keep in mind is marking the proper insertion depth to make sure it goes in all the way. You could use your Sharkbite deburring tool which also serves as a depth gauge or you could use this chart and mark it manually. Once it\u2019s marked, insert the first side and then the second, it should align perfectly with the mark you made and the connection is done. The reason why you need to make absolutely sure that the pipe is fully penetrated is that if it isn\u2019t, it\u2019ll catch on the teeth but won\u2019t go past the o-ring which will most probably cause it to leak. If you are working with PEX, make sure your fitting has a pipe stiffener in it, it does exactly the same thing as the brass sleeves when using compression fittings and not all push fittings have them. These aren\u2019t required on copper or CPVC but could be left on at your discretion.\nYou could install your \u00bc\u201d plastic tube that goes to the refrigerator at this point, but I\u2019m gonna be showing you how to solder on a T with a valve so you have both methods to choose from.\nLike I mentioned in the beginning, if you aren\u2019t familiar with soldering, I have an easy to follow step by step video on how to correctly solder a copper joint so I\u2019ll leave a link in the description box below for you to watch it and this card here as well.\nSo same as before, cut the pipe to length and deburr the inside. This time you\u2019ll need to clean both pipe ends with a scotch pad or emery cloth and flux them using a water-soluble flux. I am using this little gadget right here called the Fluxuator to apply my flux, which is Copaflux and is lead-free and water-soluble which are 2 important things to make sure of when choosing your flux. Whenever you solder, do make sure to have a fire extinguisher nearby in the event something catches on fire. Once everything is fluxed, assemble your \u00bd\u201d compression valve onto your T and start to heat it at the bottom. You wanna use a lead-free solder when working on potable lines or they\u2019ll get contaminated and you\u2019ll literally be drinking lead if you choose the wrong one. Test the fitting every now and then to see if it\u2019ll suck in the solder. Once it\u2019s hot enough, apply the solder up until you see a drip start to form on the bottom, this is a good indicator that the joint if properly filled, it normally only takes the diameter of the pipe your soldering in solder, so a \u00bd\u201d pipe requires 1/2\u201d of solder. Good! Now that everything is soldered up, wait a few minutes for everything to cool down and use a rag to clean the excess flux before proceeding. A quick note here is never connect the plastic pipe and then solder, you could only imagine what the results would be.\nWith everything cooled down, let\u2019s connect the plastic pipe. Just as before, make sure the pipe end is cut square and free of any scratches or debris, slip on the retainer nut, plastic ferrule, and the brass sleeve and tighten it using your adjustable wrench. Remember to orientate the ferrule in the right direction, tapered side towards the fitting like you see here. So insert the tube into the valve and hand tighten the retainer nut to make sure it\u2019s not cross-threaded. Then your adjustable wrench and start tightening, you\u2019ll feel when it gets tight enough and that\u2019s pretty much how it needs to be if it leaks afterward, just give it an extra \u00bc turn and it should do the trick.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FR2/UBUM/JQWT4CBM/FR2UBUMJQWT4CBM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUO/2KCV/JQWT4D56/FUO2KCVJQWT4D56.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXP/V9VT/JQWT4FCJ/FXPV9VTJQWT4FCJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3B/LCH3/JQWT4FGB/F3BLCH3JQWT4FGB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1W/TEIG/JQWT4FJ3/F1WTEIGJQWT4FJ3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD0/EWSL/JQWT4FLV/FD0EWSLJQWT4FLV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXA/XWSZ/JQWT4FQG/FXAXWSZJQWT4FQG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLO/P6T7/JQWT4FYQ/FLOP6T7JQWT4FYQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNM/1LKE/JQWT4FT7/FNM1LKEJQWT4FT7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH9/ZV0F/JQWT4G0D/FH9ZV0FJQWT4G0D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRW/84MN/JQWT4G35/FRW84MNJQWT4G35.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIR/AQG0/JQWT4G55/FIRAQG0JQWT4G55.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY9/8808/JQWT4G76/FY98808JQWT4G76.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLG/F06C/JQWT4G94/FLGF06CJQWT4G94.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRU/C96M/JQWT4GB4/FRUC96MJQWT4GB4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYO/BPA5/JQWT4GD5/FYOBPA5JQWT4GD5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F94/1WYO/JQWT4GHI/F941WYOJQWT4GHI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLO/VA5I/JQWT4GF6/FLOVA5IJQWT4GF6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRY/9TJS/JQWT4GH6/FRY9TJSJQWT4GH6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8X/9VJ9/JQWT4GLB/F8X9VJ9JQWT4GLB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW4/NLFO/JQWT4GM8/FW4NLFOJQWT4GM8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK7/TWO5/JQWT4GO2/FK7TWO5JQWT4GO2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7D/8H81/JQWT4GQ3/F7D8H81JQWT4GQ3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6N/YGC7/JQWT4H3F/F6NYGC7JQWT4H3F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ9/0D7V/JQWT4H78/FJ90D7VJQWT4H78.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6V/0FL2/JQWT4H9I/F6V0FL2JQWT4H9I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOJ/R64V/JQWT4H99/FOJR64VJQWT4H99.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKX/POZX/JQWT4HBN/FKXPOZXJQWT4HBN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF0/P3LH/JQWT4HDT/FF0P3LHJQWT4HDT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNY/G4VO/JQWT4HJP/FNYG4VOJQWT4HJP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGH/2T2M/JQWT4HLQ/FGH2T2MJQWT4HLQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLJ/ZBRV/JQWT4HNZ/FLJZBRVJQWT4HNZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJQ/WIL1/JQWT4HNQ/FJQWIL1JQWT4HNQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSZ/BJLC/JQWT4HU8/FSZBJLCJQWT4HU8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFY/4PV7/JQWT4HV8/FFY4PV7JQWT4HV8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR0/UNLA/JQWT4HVG/FR0UNLAJQWT4HVG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Making the Connection (water Source)"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "We\u2019ll be testing these connections out later once everything is done, so let\u2019s go back upstairs for now.\nYou\u2019ll only be needing approximately 5 to 6 feet of loose piping to be able to pull the fridge in and out for an occasional cleaning. To cut it, use your utility knife and cut any excess off as square as possible just like this.\nFor the connections, the same basic techniques apply for this part and they could be connected together in 2 different ways like before using either a push or compression coupling. The push coupling is pretty straight forward and installs the same way as the T I just showed downstairs, just make sure both ends are fully inserted before attempting to turn the water on. These smaller versions of push fittings don\u2019t require a pipe stiffener as the bigger size ones do for plastic pipes.\nIf you decided to go with the compression coupling, make sure both pipe ends are cut straight, slip on the retainer nut, ferrule, brass sleeve and tighten everything together.

I used amples of glue and let it secure to the base completely before pushing the cylinders through all the way. The 4 other housings are all separate but are identical with the pivotal hole and syringe hole located perpendicular to each other. The current hole diameters are so accurate to a 13mm Dia Syringe, there was no need to add any glue. The syringes here were slid into the housing until just past the front taper (about 1-2ml mark). The next part is the end plates, these are the parts that are pushed by the response syringes. there are 4 in total, the square end connected to the claw itself is left until last, the other 3 are round and be glue to the remaining 3 freely housed syringe plungers (the part your thumb touches).\nThe Claw\nAlthough complex looking, the claw is very simple to work through, start by gluing the claw grips, then fix the pivotal points to the claw chassis.

Next comes the square syringe end plate and join it to the two links, spread the claw apart to allow accessible space to connect the linkages to the moving pivot point of the claw levers.

These features include: 1. a car seat mounted in place of the stock seat at a 30-degree recline to keep Trexton firmly in place while operating the vehicle, 2. a large tray mounted perpendicular to his car seat and spanning the width of the vehicle to provide Trexton\u2019s arms with a supporting structure on the way to the throttle switch, and 3. a hand-operated throttle button in lieu of the standard foot-operated pedal encircled by a ring of bright LEDs to increase its appeal to Trexton by contrasting with the plain black covering of the tray.\nA list of parts and tools used to complete this project are shown in the accompanying images.\nSee also the unabridged version of this build report in downloadable pdf format attached to step 8.", "title": "WSU GoBabyGo Modification - Adjustable Tray and Throttle Button", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/WSU-GoBabyGo-Modification-Adjustable-Tray-and-Thro/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "A standard toggle switch (figure 1) was mounted to the back of the vehicle, just inside the right taillight to serve as an easily accessible emergency stop switch.

Then, the area immediately around the adjustment slot was recessed on the back of the tray ~1/4\u201d using the router equipped with a cutting bit. Finally, a shallow outline was cut around the recess using the router set to ~1/8\u201d depth to accommodate the plastic cover.\nThe cover was 3D printed from standard PLA material set to 3mm layer height with 100% infill. Two straps were fabricated from the black vinyl material and attached on one end with wood screws and washers. The straps were fitted over each side of the plastic cover and attached on the other end with the Velcro-style Command strips. The strips on the tray side were additionally secured with two staples each while the strap side was further secured using hot glue. The tray was then covered on the front side using satin black pleather while the back was covered with vinyl. The front material was secured using contact cement around the adjustment slot and multiple staples on the back side. The staples were hidden by the backside material that was also secured around the adjustment slot using contact cement but then secured around the edges using upholstery nails.\nThe throttle button was mounted on a 3D printed bevel (3mm layer height; 30% infill) that allows for a single bolt passing through a hole in its center to be used to secure the button to the tray through the adjustment slot. A wingnut was used on the back of the tray to allow for easy lateral adjustment of the button.\nFinally, the battery case for the LED light strip was secured to the back side of the tray using a 3D printed case. The case was custom made to fit the battery case with slots for the power switch and power cables to be accessed from the outside.

I highly recommend doing this because it is more accurate and makes the job a whole lot easier. One thing you MUST do is make sure you tongue grow gradually smaller! When you have a satisfactory template of a tongue, cut the side 1 cm shorter. You do this so the tongue doesn't interfere with the sides in steps to come. On my model shoe I noticed that it had red material on the outside and fawn on the inside. I duplicated this by sticking red coloured card to fawn coloured card. This technique will be used again later in this Instructable.

In the end it's a power supply, then the main part of an assembly tutorial \"should\" be related to electronic instead of plastic.\nFirst warning: i didn't see any indication about the voltmeter trimming. You have to use a small screwdriver to calibrate the voltmeter BEFORE sealing the case with the glue, otherwise you won't have a precise voltage regulation. The trimmer is shown in the image, red arrow. Pay attention not to create shorts with the screwdriver.\nUSB ins't the only charging option, you can use also the TP4056 +/- input pads, which accept a voltage beetween 4 and 8V. The typical supplied voltage is still 5V (like the usb) but it could be interesting to know what could be used to recharge this device. For instance: a pre-usb-era old mobile phone charger, with its original connector replaced by another one, compatibile with the one you could have soldered on the TP4056 input pad (like i did in this other project).\nYou have to balance the cells before any parallel connection! Otherwise one cell will discharge charging the other one, as fast as they can, and this could be way over the safe charge/discharge speed. It could be dangerous!\nKeep always in mind that the 18650 li-ion cells are intrinsecally dangerous! Soldering on them is not trivial at all, it could be done of course, but you really have to understand what you are doing. 18650's gurus like this guy actually prefer to solder the cells instad of using a spot welder, and they know what they are doing. I'm quite sure that a cells' soldering tutorial is available in pretty much every language, so please spend few minutes to understand the process and the risks in your mother tongue (or whichever language you are fluent in). For instance, pretend to have a drop of tin falling in the small gap near the positive pole, shorting the cell and impossible to remove within seconds. Well, that's why i do my stuff with a bucket filled with water near me. Never actually used, but better safe than sorry, right?\nMaybe someone is guessing why the OP used two cells. Not one, not three, two. Well, i'm guessing too but i have few info that i'd like to share. The advantages of two cells instead of one are quite easy to understand: you have two cell in parallel, therefore additional capacity and you could use also some old and low performing cells. The TP4056 is set to protect a cell with nice performance, and old worn out cell might be stressed by that. The standard TP4056 have an output current limit of 1.2A, not a lot but it could cause heat generation if you use cells with high internal resistance (aka: old and/or worn out). With two cells in parallel the 1.2A current will be splitted. It's not suggested to use old cells, of course, but let's say that's a smaller issue if they are two.\nFollowing this reasoning, why not three or four cells? Well, two cells it the suggested maximum cell number to be connected to a single TP4056. Why? Because of charge safety. Not to mention the eternity that would be required to charge 4 3000mAh cells in parallel with no more than 1A of current. While time might not be relevant, safety is! The issue here is the mechanism that will stop the charge. After the constant current (CC) phase the TP4056 will switch to a constant voltage (CV) phase, and it will check the current consumption to determine whether the charge should proceed or not. there's has a threshold current, let's say 25mA, which is the limit beetween a fully charged cell and a cell that can accept other energy. The cell won't stop to accept current by itself, that's why this threshold current must be monitored. If you add to the equation that the supplied voltage might not be exaclty 4.20V, maybe it's a little more as per the TP4056 data sheet, it will be even more clear that you can't just apply a stable voltage to a lithium cell. Now, how can the TP4056 determine if it's charging one or ten cell? Easy, it can't! Therefore it won't have any clue if it's overcharging -for instance- five cells connected in parallel or correctly charging a single cell. As long as the five hypothetical cells adsorb 5mA each, which is way less than the 25mA rated as safe, for the TP module everything is proceeding in the proper way but it's not!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FI8/AVI1/JR6OJ702/FI8AVI1JR6OJ702.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8H/H6AG/JR6OKEVE/F8HH6AGJR6OKEVE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Electrical Considerations"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "It's not like a portable powerwall but...\nI've used two reclaimed 1700mAh for this prototype (yes, i'm wondering if I should design a V2.0), therefore i have 3400mAh @ 3.7V. The maximum current for this cells is constrained by the TP4056 overcurrent protection, which is 1.2A for most part of the modules. If you use reclaimed cells you should check that both can more or less handle 1.2A, just to be sure. New cells from reputable suppliers will be ok. Do you know how to perform a discharge test? Well, google it, you'll need few other tools.\nSince the power supply output is variable it's a nonsense to ask \"how many amps can i have?\" because we should talk about how many watts it can provide. To stay safe we can take 4W on average but when the cells are drained the limit will likely be 3W: max current times minimum voltage 1.2A x 2.5V = 3W. Please note that this doesn't depend on the cell's quality but on the TP4056 capability instead: Better cell will only have this power drop later in time, which is really nice, but it can't avoid it.\nWith my cell this means that i can have a 5V 800mA output for a couple hours at least, with the proposed ones you should have the same output watts but for 6-7h.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXU/H9RS/JR6OKPZU/FXUH9RSJR6OKPZU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Performance"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "On the OP page there's a video that explain the physical assembly of the case, so it's not really useful to describe the same process by words, i'll only provide some additional hints and photos.\nFirst hint: the hole for the step-up trimmer (the one that will change the output voltage) could end in a wrong place.

During one of these \"meetings of the mind,\" I asked myself, \"Self, Can I/We make a drum out of a Sonotube?\" My response was, \"I don't know ... probably? ... that's a dumb idea ... only one way to find out.\"\n\nPro Tip: Take a drum head to the store when shopping for your cardboard drum shell. Moreover, anytime you are shopping for a part dependent on size/fit, take the mating part (or old part) with you. This goes for drum heads, furnace filters, random light bulbs, random batteries, anything involving a screw/bolt/washer/nut, etc.\n\nThat being said ... when you take a drum head to a home center, you automatically become a street performer. It doesn't matter if you don't want the attention - you're getting the attention. It's like being in the grocery store and watching the milkmaid manhandle every single gallon ... looking for the date which stretches furthest into the future. Milk so fresh she won't have to start using it for three weeks. If she wants milk that fresh, why doesn't she just get a cow?! Sorry ... I swerved off topic for a second there.\n\nConcrete form tubes are not beholden to a diametrical standard. Go to your local home center and you'll find two, sometimes three tubes nested within each other like Matryoshka dolls, yet they are all labeled as the same diameter. Maybe this is due to a lapse in quality control ... maybe Chuck, the guy responsible for this stage of fabrication, was nodding off - dammit Chuck!! ... or maybe your back deck/out building just doesn't care if all of its footings are identical. We swerved again.\n\nMy point is ... test the fit of your drum head on several cardboard tubes. Channel your inner Goldilox - not too tight ... not too loose ... just right. Roundness is also a key factor. You'll find a plethora of egged/oval tubes, so dig for the elusive perfect circle. Also, all of the contractors will be looking and laughing at you.\n\nPoints of clarification\n1. Yes, I realize Sonotube is a brand name and \"concrete form tube\" is more accurate.\n2. I really wanted a 14\" tube, but they aren't available in retail locations in my geographical region. In fact, I could only find them online from Menards (Sonotube brand) and for me, shipping wasn't a consideration because I wanted a \"pristine\" tube.\n3. Lowes carries Sakrete tubes, which aren't visually appealing IMO.\n4. Home Depot carries QUIK-TUBES - the most visually striking IMO ... sadly, they lacked 12\" diameter when I was in the market.", "title": "The QUIK-TUBE Snare Drum", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/The-QUIK-TUBE-Snare-Drum/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I started with a longer than necessary section of QUIK-TUBE for two reasons.\n1.

I wouldn't use an expensive blade (Forrest for example), but at same the time, I wouldn't use an old blade with low tooth count. An old blade seems like a good idea, but you might end up inflicting undesirable blunt force trauma to the cardboard tube. Personally, I used an 80 tooth Freud Diablo.\nJig Note\nI cut all shell stock using my shop made roller jig on the table saw. The wooden frame/deck hooks over the factory table saw fence and the rollers are made from threaded rod, sealed bearings, and 2\" PVC. I'll be building a new version, which will have an Instructable.

Envision making a cardboard knife and trying to sharpen one edge. Not only does delamination become an issue, but any pressure on the edge will just result in crushing/mushrooming. My solution was to use actual plywood drum shell stock as wooden end caps.\n\nThe shell stockl is 6 ply and 10\" diameter. The outer diameter doesn't perfectly match that of the cardboard, so it won't be a flush transition, but it's close enough and will be concealed by metal hoop of the drum head. I'm working with a much longer section of shell than the end product requires because it provides stability while cutting and is therefore safer - less tipping/rocking and flexing. It also makes it possible to mill both end cap from one piece of stock (one on each end) instead of switching between two pieces..\n\nThe goal is to reduce the outer diameter until it fits inside of the cardboard tube. It's basically a circumferential rabbet, but you could also think of it like a tenon on a turned, lidded box. Once the proper blade height is set, I carefully lower the shell into the roller jig and rotate it until the 360 cut path is complete - then carefully remove the shell from the jig. From that point, it just a matter of nudging the fence and repeating the process until you reach the desired rabbet width [Fig. 1].\nNote: Since I don't have a flat bottom blade, the successive cuts leave ridges and inconsistencies. In this scenario, that's actually a favorable result since it will add more tooth for the adhesive.\n\nExpecting chip out on the edge, which did occur, I milled the rabbets wider than necessary. After deciding on 1\" rabbets, marks were made, and the excess was cut off using the roller jig [Fig. 2 & 3]. The fence was then adjusted to 2\" and the two end caps cut free [Fig. 4 & 5].\nNote: 1\" of exposed end cap is more than required, but the final dimension will be established during a test assembly.\n\nA light pass through the drum sander removed any tooling marks from the saw blade and flattened the faces [Fig. 6].", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2N/D03R/JQQYKGE0/F2ND03RJQQYKGE0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQL/RP8U/JQQYKGEA/FQLRP8UJQQYKGEA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD5/WA79/JQQYIXTB/FD5WA79JQQYIXTB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZQ/HLUE/JQQYIXUO/FZQHLUEJQQYIXUO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO0/0J0B/JQQYKGEC/FO00J0BJQQYKGEC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJE/7KXT/JQQYKGEK/FJE7KXTJQQYKGEK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE5/4VKH/JQQYIXW3/FE54VKHJQQYIXW3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Fabricating the Wooden Endcaps"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The inside of QUIK-TUBES have a \"special coating\" for moisture resistance and since I wasn't sure how that would affect adhesion, I roughed up the gluing area with a dremel and sanding drum.\n\nWhen adhering disparate materials, epoxy is my #1 choice.

When I say discerningly, I mean complete coverage, but not so much that it's running and dripping.\n\nNote: I added masking tape around the edge of the cardboard as a preventative measure regarding epoxy squeeze out. If it comes in contact with the cardboard, it will soak in and result in discoloration.\nNote 2: If you work with epoxy and/or resin and don't have a silicone mat, I highly recommend the purchase.\n\nEven with my controlled epoxy application and tape masking, there was minimal squeeze out. I let it cure and then removed it with 120 grit sand paper - orbital sander for the bulk and then hand sanding close to the cardboard edge.\nAt this point, I could test fit a drum head to determine how much of the end cap could be removed. Turns out the metal hoop can easily conceal 1/2\", so I could trim 1/2\" off both the bottom and top.

Because my roof was a 3-12 pitch the attic space is real cramped and the supply ducting filled it up leaving little room for the return ducting. The best solution was to make a custom return duct / boot/ filter holder.\nThe following pictures show the process. I made a foam mock up of the inside of the duct starting with a base and 19\u201d round to represent the \u201cin\u201d and \u201cout\u201d of the duct.

The whole thing was then painted 2 coats with latex paint to protect it from the vinyl ester resin used in the fiberglass process.\nI used fiberglass mat cloth for building boats.

We like the full screen windows in the summer and didn't want to install windows that would block any of the airflow when the weather is nice outside.\nFirst I looked at installing sliding windows and also got a quote from a window installer. The quote was over $6000 so we defenestrated that idea. Next I looked at custom storm inserts. This quote was better but I still didn't want to spend $3000+ for this project. I started looking into material costs for making storm windows myself. At first I was very discouraged. The shipping cost for the plexiglass sheets was going to be much more than the cost of the sheets themselves. Fortunately there was a plastic supplier with a local office (piedmontplastics) who not only cut the sheets for me, but the price came in way under what I was looking to spend. Total the plexiglass ended up costing $360.32 for 9 windows and a door.", "title": "Porch Plexiglass Storm Windows", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Porch-Plexiglass-Storm-Windows/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Step one is measuring.

For my project however, the frame was still rigid enough and the strength of the plexiglass ended up fixing any curved pieces. Used my table saw blade to cut a dado for the plexiglass which worked really well as the plexiglass was 1/8\" and the table saw blade is the same thickness.

The second picture of the frame with no plexiglass was a test frame to make sure it would fit as I envisioned. Not a bad idea to make one and check your measurements before doing the rest!

This thing will be capable of doing 15+ MPH when I'm done, so keeping the center of gravity low and the wheels spread out to prevent rollover was a consideration.\nThe main point of this mock up was to get a good idea of where I'd be locating the rear axle in relation to the body.

Once the body is off, I'll have to go by my notes from this section to make sure everything ends up where I intended it.\nAlso, I adapated the stock front spindles to fit the new wheels. The stock spindles are 7/16\" steel rod. I simply slipped a piece of 1/2\" CPVC tubing over the spindle and pressed the 5/8\" wheel hub over that.

Also, make sure that the grade is such that it slopes away from the house. Your city will probably have regulations on the angle of the grade so you should check with them.\nMake a couple of wood stakes and put them where the corners are going to be. Use the 3,4,5 method to make sure the building is square. Once the corners are marked, figure out where the support posts should go. In this particular build, the sun room was going to have a cathedral ceiling, so one of the support beams had to be placed right at the edge of the sun room. This is because there needs to be a post going from the floor of the sun room up to the bottom of the ridge board and that needs support from underneath. Otherwise, put the row of support post one foot in from the outside edge of the structure\nThere are two rows of three support posts; one row at the outside edge of the proposed sun room and one row two feet from the existing house. The size of your beam will determine how far you can space the support posts apart. Check your local building code.\nThis build has screw piles for the support posts instead of sonotubes. In this area there is five to six feet of frost in winter so heaving is a real problem. Because there is so much glass in a sun room, heaving can cause a lot of damage. These screwpiles went about 8 feet down and were installed by machine. They are not going to move. Sonotubes take longer because you have to dig the holes, pour the cement and backfill with sand so that the frost will not get as much of a hold on the cement posts.

A knee wall is optional but most people like a knee wall because it is a place to put plugs in and you are less likely to damage the glass windows. To figure out the size of the windows, I just calculated how wide the boards had to be in between the windows and subtracted that out and then divide by the number of windows along that wall.

Sounds easy, right? Well, I have to tilt the table of the bandsaw over to 10 degrees to make the cut, so you really lose most of your ability to steer the cut left or right. Luckily the starting cuts help to keep things going pretty straight so most of the cuts go pretty smooth. I just have to do this ~60 more times.

Now for lining things up to cut, I made a 4\" reference disk out of plywood with an 1/8\" hole in the center.

The coaster on the bottom left is the one that I used to line up on 0,0 like shown in the previous photo.\nAll of the large sheets are easy because they are all the same, so I can just repeat the same tool path over and over again to cut these out. The smaller sheets from the last cuts of the big block are all organized from shortest to longest and I keep taking off the circle from the end of the cut when it no longer falls on the end of the board in the tool path.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ4/JHNY/JR4WLUHZ/FJ4JHNYJR4WLUHZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN4/L9U6/JR4WLUIG/FN4L9U6JR4WLUIG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5B/H0Y8/JR4WLUIH/F5BH0Y8JR4WLUIH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: Cutting Out the Circles"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "While the CNC is running, I'm cutting the tabs that held the circles in place on the sheet using the bandsaw.

The faces of the coasters were still rough since the planer was trying to cut through partial end grain, so the sander brings the faces smooth and really pulls out that pattern to another level.\nWith the faces sanded smooth, the last surface to be sanded is all of the edges. I use tape on my fingers to give myself some grip but also to keep my finger tips from getting cut up on the sharp edges since I have to do this almost 300 times. But the edge of each of the coasters is run over the sander until it's smooth and then it gets tossed in the bucket.\nNow the last bit of sanding is to soften the corners. I pull out my 1/16\" round over bit to do this, it's a trick that I learned from an old woodworker. A 1/16\" round over doesn't even sounds like it would be anything, but it's just enough to soften the corners and it creates a much more consistent shape then just sanding the edges would.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FE0/4P3Q/JR4WLUIK/FE04P3QJR4WLUIK.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6H/UO1X/JR4WLUIL/F6HUO1XJR4WLUIL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4W/SUVQ/JR4WLUJ4/F4WSUVQJR4WLUJ4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 12: Sanding and Rounding Over"}, {"step": 13, "steps_text": "For the final sanding and branding, I created this clever little jig (if I can say so myself).

The circle in the piece of plywood holds it in place, while the disk allows for it to rotate easily to sand the entire surface with 220 grit.\nNow for branding the disk is removed so that when I put the coaster in the hole it sits flush with the piece of plywood. The thin piece of plywood sitting on top just gives me a way to align the branding iron in the same spot every time so that the \"Carolina\" brand is in the same exact spot every time. There is just a single screw holding it in place so that it can pivot out of the way to reload each of the coasters.\nI get a bunch of self adhesive cork disks to stick to the bottom of the coasters. First I blast them with my air compressor to remove any dust. The theory with applying the cork now before finish is that I thought the cork wouldn't stick so well after finish was applied. I did some tests after this though and I would recommend just waiting and putting the cork on after finish is applied.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSS/Z5Y0/JR4WLUJL/FSSZ5Y0JR4WLUJL.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWW/4XG6/JR4WLUK2/FWW4XG6JR4WLUK2.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOI/H5GJ/JR4WLUK5/FOIH5GJJR4WLUK5.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 13: Final Sanding and Branding"}, {"step": 14, "steps_text": "Then I just need to get geared up for the last step, finish application.\nThe tung oil finish is applied to all of Carolina's coasters.

In this photo I am holding a door, while a drawer front is laying under it on the tablesaw.\nFrom these actual Ikea doors and drawers I learned that the key measurement is 1/8 inch. For a 15x30 drawer, the drawer front measured 14-7/8\" by 29-7/8\". For a 12x30 upper cabinet, the actual door measured 11-7/8\" by 29-7/8\".

I made the jig reversible so that it could clamp on either side of the drawer.\nIt's just a piece of plywood with six holes drilled in it, and a lip of plywood around the edge, so that I can hold it firmly against the lower part of the drawer front. I then used a 3/16\" brad point drill to mark on my custom drawer fronts where to drill.\nI used a drill press to then drill the holes, as I was concerned that the plywood jig might wear out from repeated drilling.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDT/XUS1/JOWSRUJH/FDTXUS1JOWSRUJH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTI/OX09/JOWSRUJL/FTIOX09JOWSRUJL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Drawer Front Jig"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "I made a similar sort of jig for the doors.

I chose to center my handles 2-1/2\" down from the top. For five-inch drawers, this means that the handle is centered. This is up to you how you want to mount your handles. The center line is important since you use it to alight the jig with the center of the drawer.\nWith the jig clamped in place, I used the pre-drilled holes to guide me as I drilled holes into the drawer fronts. IMPORTANT NOTE: I also added a block of scrap BEHIND the jig when clamping, so that the back of the hole did not blow out while drilling.\nIn the final photo, I show the door jig clamped in place and being used. Again, choose your own offsets! Our doors have 2-1/2\" wide rails and stiles, so the handles are centred on them. So the jig is set to position the mounting holes 1-1/4\" from the edge of the door.

The design we made for this Instructable is one of the most basic designs there is, so feel free to make your own additions and modifications.\nWe used the Windows app 3D builder because it's easy and quick. If you are designing you own lampshade, keep the walls to a minimal thickness (around half inch). If the walls are thicker the light will not pass through very well, but if the walls are thinner you will not have enough surface to glue the cardboard to each other.\nHow to design the lampshade:\n1. Create a 40cm sphere and \"squish\" it down to 30cm (but leave it 40mm wide on both sides)\n2. Copy this shape and make it smaller by 2cm on each side (so 26mm high and 36mm wide). Place this shape in the center of the larger one.\n3. \"Subtract\" one shape from the other, this hollows out the larger shape.\n4. Cut the bottom off of the hollow shape (exact position does not matter, as long at the hollow core is exposed enough to put the lamp in later). Personally I like to cut it around one quarter of the design.\n5. Finally, cut a hole in the top of the lampshade for the bulb socket. You can do this by drawing a cylinder with the diameter of the socket, through the top of the lampshade and then subtracting it.\n6. Save the design as .STL file", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWA/VBTH/JR0YVLX0/FWAVBTHJR0YVLX0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1D/S083/JR0YVLXP/F1DS083JR0YVLXP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0G/QQ12/JR0YVLXQ/F0GQQ12JR0YVLXQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCZ/HGZE/JR0YVLXR/FCZHGZEJR0YVLXR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI6/SNGB/JR0YVLXU/FI6SNGBJR0YVLXU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH5/RP8F/JR0YVLXY/FH5RP8FJR0YVLXY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Step 2: Design the Lampshade"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Slicer for Fusion\nOnce you are satisfied with your design you can import the design into Slicer. Don't worry about the orientation of the lampshade, if it imports sideways that fine.\nFirst of all you need to create a new material. This materials contains the properties of your cardboard, mainly the thickness and size. Click on the gear next to manufacturing settings, click any material and enter the following values:\nUnits: mm\nLength: 1000\nWidth: 1000\nThickness: whatever the thickness of your cardboard is (for me 6mm)\nall other settings are fine as they are.\nOf course you can change the units to imperial, make sure that at the end of the slicing process most or all objects are on one sheet, it does not matter if the sheet doesn't fit on the laser cutter. We will be solving that later.\nMake sure that the object size is in mm, and that the boxes original size and uniform scale are ticked. Select the \"stacked slices\" slicing technique, you will start to see your lampshade take shape! Depending on how the design was imported, you might need to change the slicing direction. Click the \"slice direction\" button and move the blue pointer along the axis to the correct direction.\nBefore you export the design, check the assembly steps. Here you can see the lampshade built up from start to finish. Finally, click the \"get plans\" button and export as .EPS to your computer. You can find our exported file below.\nIllustrator\nAfter the slicing process, the design needs to be cleaned up. Import the .EPS in illustrator and if there are multiple files, copy and paste to form one large temporary file. Having all of the objects in one file makes it easier to fit objects inside of each other to save space, but we will get to that in a moment.\nYou will notice each ring has a outside and inside which are blue. All rings also have a number in red and small dots in blue and red at the top, bottom and sides. Some rings also have a red circle between the blue lines, sometimes solid, sometimes broken.\nI don't know why this get's generated in Slicer but we want to get rid of anything we don't want on the lampshade, so the dots and the solid/broken red circles need to be removed. The easiest way to do this is to select all, ungroup and release compound paths. Then, select all blue rings with select > same > appearance, and then while holding shift, select all numbers individually and move everything (blue circles and numbers) away from everything we don't want. If this it too hard you can also just move object by object. After doing this you will have only blue circles and red numbers. Select all other items and delete those.\nNow it's time to efficiently fit objects inside of each other, this saves time and material. If you have many shapes consider using a software, but because there are only a few shapes in this design I do it by hand. Make sure that you select both de circles and numbers when moving objects and also make sure that the circles don't overlap.\nAfter making the objects more space-efficient you can start making the cut files. Open a new window in Illustrator and enter the exact sizes of your cardboard. Place objects in the cut file and when there is no more space in the file open a new file and do the same for the remaining objects. Repeat until there are no more objects.\nLaser cutting\nWe use self-built laser cutters so it would be pointless for us to walk you through the steps for our machine. However below are some basic pointers for laser cutting:\n- Depending on the thickness of your material, place the vocal point on or a bit below the surface of the cardboard.\n- Turn on air assist\n- Cardboard may no lay flat on the bed, in that case cut it in smaller pieces with a box knife.\n- On our 100w machine we used 100% power at 60mm/s for the cutting, and 10% at 40mm/s for engraving. While it may not be perfect for you, it's a starting point.\n- Set the numbers to line engraving, not raster engraving.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYO/LWGB/JR0YVM2F/FYOLWGBJR0YVM2F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZC/O41S/JR0YVM2G/FZCO41SJR0YVM2G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1G/RAXR/JR0YVM2J/F1GRAXRJR0YVM2J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWD/5XAY/JR0YVM2K/FWD5XAYJR0YVM2K.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Step 3: Preparing the Design for Lasercutting"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Start with laying all of the cut objects in the correct order, make sure to always hide the number out of sight.

Make sure that they are perfectly aligned with each other. wait a few seconds for the glue to settle and then repeat this process for the fourth, fifth etc. up until the middle of the lamp. Repeat for the other side of the lamp\nNow you have two, almost complete, lampshade halves and the outer cardboard slice or each side. These can now be glued on. The reason why you will want to skip these in the beginning is that the soot from the cardboard gets on your hands and it leaves fingerprints on the ends because you are constantly applying pressure there.\nTip: Keep a damp rag nearby to wipe you fingers on occasionally. You can also use this rag to clean up spilled glue.\nFinally, glue the two lampshade halves together and marvel at your creation!

At a cost of around \u20ac 200, it is quickly amortized.\nPrinciple\nIn winter, the sensor sucks in the air from below, heats it thanks to the shaving sun, then restores it to the habitat through the high outlet, at a temperature of up to 70 \u00b0 C locally instantly diluted in the ambient atmosphere.\nIn summer, an external hatch allows to reject the hot air of the sensor outside while aspiring at the same time the air of the habitat, thus creating a natural ventilation.\nA valve connected to a thermostatic jack, allows to manage automatically and without electricity, the opening of the air circulation, only when it has reached more than 25 \u00b0 C in the sensor.\nMaterials/Tools:\nThe tutorial presented here is 2.09m x 1.09m overall\nMATERIAL:\nSensor:\nChevron Douglas (here the final section is 95mm x 45mm)\n2 of 2m10\n2 of 1m10\n15 m of douglas sheets (20mm x 53mm)\nRigid plate (here plywood filmed, 10mm)\nRigid insulation (here Steico plate, 22mm)\nSika cartridge\nSilicone cartridge\nPU glue for outdoor wood gluing\nWood glue\nNails\nWood screws, from 30mm to 150mm\nComprehensive seal\nLinseed o\u00efl\nWood varnish 15 m of douglas sheets (30mm x 16 mm)\nAluminum adhesive\nTempered glass or polycarbonate plate (1m x 2m)\nExpanded metal grid (300mm x 50mm)\n4 screw legs (example)\n1m of aluminum drip 100mm width (example)\nDouble-sided adhesive\nThin insulation (here parquet insulation)\n30 to 35 slates 320mm x 220mm, thickness 3,5mm\n8 reinforced squares, mini width 40mm\n1 tube diameter 100mm length of the housing wall, pvc / aluminum / stainless steel for the low entrance\nValve system:\n1 Thermostatic cylinder Vernet EL 0769\n100mm of brass tube diameter 4mm\nCompression spring length 70mm\n1 washer\n1 small screw\n2 rivets\n5 cm of copper wire diameter 2mm\n1 domino electrician diameter 4mm\nPlumbing / gas equipment:\n100mm of threaded brass tube 15/21\n2 brass blind nuts 15/21\n1 brass through nut 15/21\n1 copper sleeve diameter 12mm\n1 copper sleeve diameter 14mm\n1 brass nipple 15/21\n1 ventilation valve, here diameter 100mm\n1 ball catch\n1 aluminum or stainless steel tube along the wall of the house wall, diameter of the valve\nOptional :\nRain barrier\nSealant\nTOOLS:\nWood saw\nScrewdriver / drill and wood / metal drills\nWall stapler\nPaint brushes\nHammer\nCutter\nGrinder and diamond / metal discs", "title": "Solar Air Heater", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Solar-Air-Heater/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Note:\nHere, the frame is sized to accommodate a glass 1m x 2m by 6mm thick, a 10mm film plywood bottom and a 22mm insulating layer in STEICO.

I used a Kreg miter slot stop block to set a definitive stopping point for the sled and set my desired blade height. My sled doesn't have an integrated ruler, so I temporarily attached a seamstress tape measure using clear packing tape. Lastly, I set the sled stop block for my starting point.\nNote: I cut these grooves in a long length of dowel and cut it to final length afterwards ... that's how I keep my hands at a safe distance. I would NOT do this with a short dowel.\nNote 2: If you are uncomfortable with this method in ANY way .. DON'T do it. Just draw them on or something.\n\nThe dowel is placed on the sled with a firm grip, sled advanced into the blade until it hits to the stop, dowel rotated until the groove is fully cut, and then the sled is backed out.

This results in 1/8\" wide grooves (size of the blade kerf) with 3/16\" separation.\n\nSlots\nThe slots are also cut using the sled and 5/16\" spacing, but the miter slot stop is removed and the blade height is raised.

I found a Heating Tape Thermostat (2nd picture) that turns on at 38 degrees and off at 50 degrees. It is rated at 120 volts and 15 amps - way more robust than I need. The cost was $12.\nFor Insulation, I had thought to use a sheet of foam insulation, the cost would have been $14. But one day as I was doing errands I noticed quite a few of these signs (picture 3) along the road. I consider these signs unattractive and a distraction but they are someone's property. However if you look closely, they all say \"Deadline Dec 15th\". This was December 18th so obviously the signs were abandoned property and therefore available. In the interests of public safety and roadside cleanup I promptly removed 16 of them in a 2 mile stretch.\nThese signs are made of plastic in a honeycomb structure - perfect for insulation. In fact they are superior to foam insulation according to scientific reports on the web.\nBe sure and check the pictures for notes.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9P/NP7D/JQQYKRZW/F9PNP7DJQQYKRZW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSN/AJC0/JQQYKSKV/FSNAJC0JQQYKSKV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFF/CK56/JQQYKRYA/FFFCK56JQQYKRYA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Gathering Materials"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Tools I used:\nTape Measure\nTable Saw\nMiter Saw\nBrad Gun\nRetractable Knife\nStraight Edge\nDrill Press\nScrew driver\nWire Cutters\nWire Strippers\nCAUTION: Some of the above power tools can cause serious injuries.

The compass I'd planned to draw circles with was very flimsy and had difficulty with the wood. Instead, I traced quarter-circles onto paper with my compass, cut out the paper, and used it as a template. I used a long straight edge for the diagonals. Even with that, I wasn't always happy with how things looked, and erased and re-drew things several times. Working in pencil was a great idea.\nOn the original board, the various rings are labeled with words,but I thought that would look fussy here. Instead, I used the symbols present elsewhere in the game and designated the archery ring with arrows, the knight ring with a horse silhouette, and the swordsman ring with a sword. I printed a small template for the horse and drew around it. For the arrow and sword, I used a ruler to give me a straight, two-inch line, then freehanded the rest of the drawing.\nOnce I was happy with the pencil lines, I got out the wood burner. Actually, I borrowed a friend's woodburner, really enjoyed the process, and ended up getting my own (much simpler) wood burner to finish. This was my first wood burning project. I started on the circular and straight lines to practice and see how the tool worked, then moved to the finer symbols and numbers.\nThis was a great beginner project. Some of the imperfections and hatching were done intentionally to make the board look battle-scarred. Some were not. But now that it's done, I can't tell the difference, and I'm happy with the effect. This much burning took several hours. I couldn't have done it all in one sitting -- my hand eventually got tired.

This will also have LED up-lighting to really make it stand out and a mirror at the bottom of the centrepiece.\nThis instructable is for one centre piece, though I am making eight. I've completed four so far.\nWhat you need:\n4 - 300mm x 500mm x 3mm Clear acrylic sheets (sides)\n1 - 306mm x 300mm x 3mm clear acrylic sheet (top)\n4 - smaller tinted acrylic (A5)\nTensol or other acrylic solvent\n20ml syringe with blunt metal needle.\n8 x corner clamps\n2 x adjustable straps\ncraft knife\nsandpaper\nNovus acrylic scratch remover(optional)\n250mm x 250mm mirrored acrylic\n4 LED battery powered lights\nsilver reflective tape", "title": "Acrylic Superhero Table Centre Pieces", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Acrylic-Superhero-Table-Centre-Pieces/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The first step is to clamp the sides of the acrylic box together. If the edges are too rough then lightly sand, but don't sand smooth as the acrylic glue works better with a rough surface. Also make sure the acrylic parts are straight and square. I definitely recommend laser cutting as it is the best way to cut perfectly square acrylic parts. If you buy it sawed like me then you will need to check with set square and maybe sand down a little. I know for next time to mention QA issues to my acrylic supplier that what they supplied me was not quite what I asked for. I guess I've learned an important lesson.\nThe acrylic you have purchased will have come with a protective plastic film on both sides. Do not remove this. It will help prevent scratching. What we do need to do before gluing the sides together is to carefully cut thin vertical strips off the edges of the protective film from both sides of the acrylic. See photos. This is so we get good acrylic to acrylic contact for capillary gluing. Do this on all 4 side pieces. This should be 16 strips.\nStart by arranging the clamps as shown in the first image on an even surface. These bottom clamps will actually hold the top of the centre piece because these edges will sit perfectly flush in the clamps.\nI configured the side with two sides between to end piece. So the box will end up 300mm x 306mm.\nClamp the top corners now but remember this is actually the bottom of the centrepiece. If the acrylic sides are not cut square, this is where you will see it. But it should not affect the build much.\nWhen attaching the clamps, you need to make sure that the edges are flush on every corner. Work around from corner to corner adjusting the clamps. You may need to do this a couple of times to get the fit just right.\nOnce you have all the sides clamped and square you may notice some bowing in the middle. This is probably because the acrylic has not been stored perfectly flat and has a slight bend. Even if the acrylic is pretty straight there is still likely to to be a small gap. To rectify this for gluing so that we get the best acrylic to acrylic contact, I used two luggage straps adjusted to go around the acrylic quite tightly(see photo). This should bring in any bowing nicely and make sure there is acrylic to acrylic contact for gluing.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMA/9BST/JN8YGM7F/FMA9BSTJN8YGM7F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXH/HRXD/JN8YGMBP/FXHHRXDJN8YGMBP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCP/PS8M/JN8YGM94/FCPPS8MJN8YGM94.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8U/JQYJ/JN8YGM6L/F8UJQYJJN8YGM6L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL6/VS6O/JN8YGM6N/FL6VS6OJN8YGM6N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0J/82XN/JN8YGM4X/F0J82XNJN8YGM4X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKW/S16L/JN8YGM45/FKWS16LJN8YGM45.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI4/JQNA/JN8YGM33/FI4JQNAJN8YGM33.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Clamp the Sides Together"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I used a Tensol type solvent.

This should be the side currently sitting on the table facing down and not facing up.\nTurn the box over and remove a 10 or 20mm horizontal strip from both sides of the acrylic on all 4 sides of the box. That does not sound quite right but I think you understand! :-) This should be 8 strips.\nWhen you have done this turn the box over and and leave these edges face down on the table.\nTake the square 300mm x306mm top and place it side by side with the acrylic box. Make sure they are both rotated so the dimensions match. You can lift the box on top of the square piece of acrylic to test this and rotate to match up the size. Place side by side again.\nNow remove the protective plastic film from the side of the acrylic square facing up. You will be bonding this side to the box. Lift the box on top and align the corners and sides. Make sure both parts are flush and the box is square. You should have good acrylic to acrylic contact all the way around.\nNow using the syringe, reach into the box being very careful not to touch or move it and push the metal needle right into one of the corners. Start to apply a tiny bit of pressure and the run the needle along the join to the next corner.

If you think raising your bed to 6 feet off the ground might be difficult or expensive, I'm here to debunk that notion. It's not as lofty of a goal as you might think. This project may be over your head, but it doesn't have to be out of your reach. Alright, with that out of my system, let's get into it.\nI started making this bed (like the shoe rack: https://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-Cheap-Shoe...) in order to create the least expensive option possible to maximize space in very small apartment room. The good news is that despite the room being small (9'x10') I do have 9' ceilings, so I was able to build it with walking height underneath (6 feet), while still having 2 feet between the bed and ceiling.\nCriteria:\nEveryone's criteria for a project like this may be a bit different, so I will give you mine, and tell you how I came up them to hopefully help you work through that process yourself.\nAs previously mentioned, I wanted it at a height where I could walk under. Although I mostly sit at my desk when under it, I does take up half the room, so it would have been fairly frustrating for it to be only suited for sitting. I am just over 5'9\", so I decided to place the bottom of the bed at 6'.\nI had it in my head that I wanted a queen mattress, but I probably should have just gone with a full... hindsight, right? Once you know what size mattress you want, you can refer to the chart above for dimensions.\nI wanted to make a pretty simple version because I didn't want to spend a lot. I already had the 2x4s, so I ended up spending about $160, which is more than I anticipated, but still a lot less than I could have bought one for.\nThe one place I did incur a little extra cost than I 'had to' was the stairs. I could have just done a basic ladder from 2x4s and save about $25. However, because the space was small and storage was limited, I decided to build stairs with built-in storage. The instructions for those will be at the end, so if that is not something you need, you can skip that step and save $25 as well as some time, and I will leave the creating of a ladder in your very capable hands.\nTools:\nHere are the tools I used:\nJig saw\nDrill\nPhillips Driver Bit\n3/8\" Paddle Bit\nSpeed Square\nMiter Saw\nImpact Driver\nChannel Locks\nMaterials:\nBecause I am leaving sizing open depending on your specific build, I will list the type of board, and how many you need for each part of the bed, then once you know what size you are building, you can determine the length of your cuts.\n(2) 4'x8'x1/2\" plywood\n(2) 2\"x6\" for the length of your bed\n(2) 2\"x6\" for the width of your bed\n(4) 4\"x4\" posts\n(5) 2\"x4\" the same width as your mattress\n(1) 2\"x4\" the width of your mattess + 7\" (floor brace)\n(1)2\"x4\" the length of your mattress + 7\" (side brace)\n(8) 3/8\" bolts\n(8) 3/8\" lock nuts\n(8) 3/8\" washers\n(10) 2x4 mounting brackets\n1/4\" wood screws\n3\" wood screws\nIf you are building the stairs I will give you my dimensions since they are mostly unrelated to the mattress size. My stairs are 4' tall over the 5' width of the mattress with 4 steps. This makes each step is 18\" wide and 15\" deep with a 12\" riser. You will see from the photos that I use 2x4s to build the stairs because it was easy and I had a bunch of old ones waiting to be used, but you could easily rip them into 2x2s with a table saw and they would be plenty sturdy for anyone up to my size (I weigh about 150lbs) and probably a bit bigger.\n(1) 4'x8'x1/2\" plywood (and the leftover from the bed)\n(4) 2\"x4\"x4'\n(2) 2\"x4\"x3'\n(2) 2\"x4\"x2'\n(2) 2\"x4\"x1'\n(13) 2\"x4\"18\"\nFinal Note: Since I was building this bed for my apartment I had no place here to work on it, so I had to do it at my parents house about an hour away. It was also too big to setup and then move in, so it had to be setup in the room. Because of that I had no chance to fix things once I got it setup. So, as you read through each step I will have added a Lessons Learned section to tell you the problems I have found and things I wish I would have done differently. I hope it is beneficial to you.", "title": "Inexpensive 'Bare Bones' Lofted Bed", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Inexpensive-Bare-Bones-Lofted-Bed/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The posts, as listed in the materials, are 4x4 posts, while the frame around the top of the 4x4s is made from 2x6s. Let's look at the layout for the structure and hardware of these pieces.\nI used 3/8\" bolts with washers and lock nuts to secure the 2x6s to the 4x4 posts. At each corner the long 2x6 overlaps the short one (see diagram above). You want to put the bolts as close to the center of the joint as possible, but since doing this from both 2x6s into the 4x4 would cause them to collide in the middle, they have to be shifted. Since the joint overlap is 4\" wide and 6\" tall, I decided to shift the bolts up and down. I chose one and moved it up 1/4\" and moved the other down 1/4\" (as illustrated in the second diagram).\nI measured and marked where the 2x6 would overlap the 4x4 and drilled through them while they were overlapping to ensure the holes would line up properly. It is always advisable to use a square during this process to produce accurate angles. Repeat this process on all four posts and you should have a fully supported, elevated border with inner dimensions the same as your mattress, plus a 4\" gap at the head and foot between your posts. We will use the space at the head in a later instructable when constructing the headboard.\nLastly, I used some 2 1/2\" screws to add some 2x4 braces. I put one across the back at about waist height, and one on the floor across the head end.\nLesson Learned: With no corner or X bracing, the bed is a bit wobbly, so that I something I am planning to go back and add.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNN/LW5X/JQKTYQW4/FNNLW5XJQKTYQW4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGZ/FCJ5/JQKTYR31/FGZFCJ5JQKTYR31.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE2/NJAA/JQMO8I3N/FE2NJAAJQMO8I3N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5T/T2O2/JQMO8I3O/F5TT2O2JQMO8I3O.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Building: Posts & Supports"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Okay, I probably went a little overboard on the strength of the platform.

I then cut the 1/2\" plywood to fit on top of the joists inside the 2x6 frame. By aligning the 2x4s with the bottom edge of the 2x6s, the mattress sits about 2\" deep in the frame\nLesson Learned: mount a 2x4 (oriented with the 4\" horizontal) between the two posts at the head, then do the same for the two at the foot. Align the top of these to be flush with the top of the joists. This will give end support to the plywood.

As mention in the intro, these steps are 1' tall and 15\" deep with 4 steps, for a total of 5' long and 4' tall. At the front edge of each step I created 2x4 rectangles the same height as the step. On the back of each step (which is the front the the next step I attached a cross member to support the back of the plywood that will go on top.

Do you like interior decorations that animate and create a beautiful visual show and yet you don't know how to make a Kinetic Sculpture? Then this tutorial is for you :)\n\nIf you want to watch what the final result looks like: I made a Youtube Playlist\n\nThis Spinning Kinetic Sculpture RGB is a sculpture you can fix on a wall or on a support. It is made of 2 main identical wheels that spin in opposite direction, which is creating constructive and destructive visual interferences, it is called the phenomenon of Moir\u00e9.\n\nThe concept is purely kinetic (spring), it allows the wheels to spin at different and irregular speeds but most importantly to run for a long time (+30minutes). After you rewind the mechanism the wheels start to spin in opposite direction. As soon as the gravity makes the front wheel reverse its spinning direction and pushes some pawls in the system, the 2 wheels are pushed and start to spin again. This is happening until the spring is fully unwinded. If properly optimized and by reducing the friction, it is possible to get a runtime of more than an hour!\n\nI got my inspiration from pre-existing kinetic sculptures, but I decided to make my own design and my own version of the mechanism which is the crucial point of the sculpture.\n\nhe result is a fully working Kinetic Sculpture that costs almost nothing and more importantly: the size of the mechanism is twice smaller than other documented kinetic sculpture online!\n\nYou can also fix it to support like a mounting base of a screen which will allow you to move it around but a wall will give you a far better-looking result.\n\nThe center of gravity of the wheel is placed so it acts like a pendulum. The radius of the pendulum plays a major role in the total runtime of the sculpture.\n\nIt can look complex on the first sight but if you look more closely at each step you will see that it is fairly easy. It is also very instructive because you start to understand that every piece plays a major role in the running of the sculpture. You end up with an almost magical piece of art that creates spectacular effects!\n\nYou can complete the sculpture with an RGB LED Ring connected to an Arduino, an ON/OFF switch and a battery so it looks even more amazing. Please note that only the LEDs need an electrical source of energy.\nYou can choose to not use the LEDs, it's up to you. You're only limited by your own imagination.\nUnderstanding the mechanism doesn't seem easy at first sight but that's exactly why I documented everything and wrote this tutorial with plenty of pictures and videos. What was a pain in the ass for me is going to be very easy for you?

The size of the log may also be determined by the size of your lathe. Cut the log down to the size that will work on your lathe safely. The shattered log is what gives it the effect when the bowl is finished. Even a limb or something along that line will work. Make sure to dry the wood before you start as this will cause more cracking and splitting and can add to the effect made by the epoxy. If the piece is small enough you can preheat your oven to 215 degrees and bake the wood. This low heat is all that is necessary and do not set you heat any higher as it could be dangerous if to high. At 215 degrees the heat is to low to need to worry about fire and will dry out the wood slowly. Depending on the size of the log it might take a few hours after about one hour check the log and continually check it every 30 min to an hour until it is dry. Use an oven to dry the wood at your own risk. It is safe when done properly. The center will take a good while to dry out. Once the wood is dry it time to move onto the next step.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTE/ABYL/JQQYS67V/FTEABYLJQQYS67V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F62/IMA0/JQQYS67W/F62IMA0JQQYS67W.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Find Your Wood"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The next step is to enclose the log. I had went over a few different ways to try to do this in my head but what to me seemed to be the best way and also the least time consuming was to wrap the log in packing tape. This is done for a couple of reasons. First this will stop the log from falling apart. Second this will be our make shift mold to hold in the epoxy during the pour. Make sure while you are doing this to wrap the tape as tightly as you can get it. Also cover the log in multiple layers of the tape. Epoxy will heat up during curing and move around so this can cause epoxy to find seams in the tape if there are any available. Multiple layers of tape will take care of that and make it much more difficult for the epoxy to leak. Also make sure to completely cover the bottom of the log even if there are no crack showing. There may be crack you do not see or can form while pouring. You want these to be filled with epoxy and the tape on bottom will prevent leaks. With the bottom and sides of the log completely covered add one last piece on the upper edge and let it stick over the edge this will give a barrier to stop the epoxy form going over the sides of the project from the top while pouring.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGK/5UQK/JQQYS67X/FGK5UQKJQQYS67X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQY/7GWV/JQQYS68E/FQY7GWVJQQYS68E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF9/JDA9/JQQYS68F/FF9JDA9JQQYS68F.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Enclose the Log"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "With the log tight taped up and secured its time to mix your epoxy.

During a pour like this give a couple of seconds between pours into the same crack. This will allow the epoxy to seep down and push the air up from the bottom. When poured correctly it will largely help to lower the number of air bubbles within the epoxy. If you have a pressure tank large enough to fit the project into. I highly suggest using it.

This is the point where you will dill the hole allowing a hold for the 4 jaw chuck. Once you have found the point where you will drill the hole use a 1 1/4 inch forstner bit to drill a hole centered on the mark.

Keep the lathe speed slow. With a misshapen log it will be off balance. This will cause vibration in the lathe. Just keep the speed slow and start to shape the bowl by slowly cutting the corners down from the bottom working your way up. Do not use a standard gouge to do this. As I said previously this is end grain turning and if you use a standard gouge it will likely dig into the end grain and cause the tool to catch. This can be dangerous and damage your project or even cause the wood to shatter or bust. Using a carbide cutting tool or a bowl gouge rough out the shape of the bowl. This could be many different shapes. I chose to go with a flat bottom egg shaped bowl. This turning will be done with the bottom of the bowl pointing toward the tail of the lathe.

Using the same 1 1/4 inch forstner bit used previously. Secure the bit into the drill chuck of the lathe only go as deep into the bottom of the bowl as necessary to insert the jaws of the chuck fully into the hole.

Do not try to cut to much material away at one time. This will can cause the bowl to bind and damage the bowl. This is also the point witch you will determine the thickness of the wall of the bowl. I find it best to do this before getting to far down into the bowl. Doing this at this point will also make it much easier to keep a consistent width of the wall from the top down to the bottom. Also at this point you want to shape the top of the bowl. Removing and flattening the top of the bowl slightly will leave a live edge contour to the rim of the bowl. After getting the width of the wall determined start at the center of the bowl were you previously drilled the expansion hole slowly work your way from the center to the interior wall of the bowl. Using the wall as your stopping point repeat this process making the cuts as smooth as possible along the inner wall. Keeping your cuts smooth will make the sanding process inside the bowl much easier. Once you have reached the bottom of the hole drilled in step Six I suggest drilling another whole to use as a stop depth gauge. Drilling this hole to the final depth that you would like the bowl to be on the interior. Be careful not to go to deep and make the base of the bowl to thin or to drill into the bottom expansion hole. Then just continue to hollow out the bowl in the same fashion as earlier.

This was achieved by using a random orbit sander to sand down the live edge to a smooth surface. After the live edge the sander can then be used on the rest of the exterior of the bowl.

While the bowl is still attached to the lathe apply a generous coat to the bowl and using a rag, brush or even your hand spread the oil over the entire surface of the bowl. If you plan to use your hand it is perfectly safe to do so without a glove but I would suggest one due to the oily residue the mineral oil will leave on you hands. Let the mineral oil set for a few mins allowing it to soak in the wood no more than 5 mins is needed and for a lighter color effect wait around one to two mins. Repeat this process on the interior of the bowl. After allowing the oil to soak remove all of the excess oil with a rag. You might have to repeat this process a couple of time as the oil seeps back out of the wood from soaking in. This is normal. Again repeat this process on the interior of the bowl. With all of the excess removed add a light coating of the eee ultra shine wax to the bowl. I suggest doing this process separately on both the exterior and interior of the bowl. Once the wax is applied turn on the lathe and with medium speed use a rag to polish the wax applying a moderate amount of pressure. With both the interior and exterior of the bowl polished remove the bowl from the lathe and repeat these steps by hand on the bottom of the bowl.
