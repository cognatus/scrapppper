I knit a couple of small rugs for my kitchen and decided that I needed one for my bedroom - but this time I wanted to try something different. My maternal Grandmother had a braided rug under the dining room table which I believe was made of wool. Although the colors were not my favorite, I remember being intrigued by the item. I even made my own version with braided yarn as a small child, though they were more coaster sized than rug size.\nI rooted around in fabric bureaus, boxes, and bins to find quilting cotton remnants that I thought would work together to create a cohesive color scheme. In the end, I loved my first pink and green version so much, I decided I had to make another in purple!", "title": "A Hand Woven and Hand Sewn Rag Rug", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/A-Hand-Woven-and-Hand-Sewn-Rag-Rug/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The first thing I knew that I wanted to avoid was raw edges. I used a few scraps of muslin to test the best way to go about creating finished edge strips. What I ended up with were three inch torn strips that I folded and ironed to hide those dreaded raw bits. To start ripping, I would clip the edge of the fabric with a pair of scissors to start the process, and then tear along the entire length of fabric. This also ensures that the strips are on grain.\nOnce three of these folded strips of cotton were ready to go, I stitched the ends together, and started braiding.\nWhen I came to the end of a strip, I would add another by stitching a torn strip to the short end, right sides together. That strip would then be taken to the ironing board to fold into a finished strip of cotton, ready for braiding.\nI just had to remember to add my next strip of fabric while it was still long enough to reach from the sewing table to the ironing board.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F52/RU23/JTENGRX4/F52RU23JTENGRX4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO7/QU66/JTENGTI6/FO7QU66JTENGTI6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUA/0XM4/JTENGS28/FUA0XM4JTENGS28.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4Q/QBLA/JTENGT8L/F4QQBLAJTENGT8L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ8/6SDX/JTENGTBT/FQ86SDXJTENGTBT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Preparing the Strips"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "My trusty sewing basket was used as a sturdy anchor point, which made it much easier to braid the pieces together.

I was expecting that I would have leftovers, but I ended up using the entire three yards for this rug.\nWhich means that I used up six yards of cotton scraps for the second and third strands of the braid.\nIt also made me reevaluate some of the tiny scraps of fabric that I have been hoarding - there is a limit to how useful micro remnants can be, and if I save every bit of cotton I will not be able to maneuver around the sewing room at all.

I decided to cut one end off 5 cotton buds and then tape the other ends together to make my own 'fork' tool.\nWe then can start weaving.

If we did the tassels/fringing section first, this would be difficult to keep in place when removing the weaving from the loom.\nWe already wove the end of the weft thread onto the loom in the previous step.

Please take care when gathering - don't damage the plants or remove any obvious habitats!\nHere are my top tips for your longer threads:\nFlaxes and large grasses are ideal - Harakeke is a staple for weaving back home! - you can use it as it is, or use the edge of your scissors to scrape off some of the flesh exposing the fibres beneath. When harvesting flax or grasses cut from the bottom:\n\nThe (flax) plant is seen as a family. The central shoot or rito was the baby and the leaves on either side of it the awhi rito or m\u0101tua (its parents).

Natural materials can be really awkward and difficult to work with! For this reason I started off my weaving with some wool. I didn't want to buy any so went with the most inoffensive colour I had....I figured it would be covered by the fringe I was planning and is a good way to show the basics of weaving!\nStart by cutting yourself a longish piece of your chosen thread onto your needle (or popsicle stick in my case). This thread is your 'weft' - the threads that are pulled through the warp. There is a LOT of jargon associated with weaving!\nSlide to dowel down to create a shed (the space between the warp threads).\nSlide your needle through the shed from left to right - straight thru the gap. You may need more than one take to get through if you cannot reach all the way, but make sure you are staying inside the shed and not catching other threads!\nPull the thread through till you have a small tail on the left side. We will tuck this in later! Use a fork to press the thread down against the carboard so it is snug.\nRaise the dowel back to the top of the loom to flatten the warp out and using your needle weave back from right to left picking up each alternate thread. You want to start so that your thread will wrap around the last warp thread when it is pulled tight You can see in the picture above that the first weft sits on top of the last warp thread, so I started my weaving by going underneath that warp thread. Continue until you get to the other side.\nPull the thread through. Once it is sitting against the right hand warp thread but not pulling it inwards (you may need to pull it back so it is sitting right - we dont want our warp warped!) hold the weft and the right hand warp thread and pull the loose end of the weft thread (on the left hand side) down to create an arc. Use the fork to press it down into the weave. Making an arc rather than pulling the weft straight through stops you from making it too tight and pulling your warp out of shape :)\nRepeat until done!\nCongratulations! You are a weaver!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRR/FSX3/JTIYKF16/FRRFSX3JTIYKF16.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVU/SMEV/JTIYKF30/FVUSMEVJTIYKF30.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8E/N19N/JTIYKF4Q/F8EN19NJTIYKF4Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB0/AB6D/JTIYKF5A/FB0AB6DJTIYKF5A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYN/NLA4/JTIYKF7A/FYNNLA4JTIYKF7A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F81/75H4/JTIYKF8L/F8175H4JTIYKF8L.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Weaving: the Basics"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "I wanted to hid the wool that I started off with and the bark I found was perfect for a thick fringe at the bottom of this piece.\nCut a whole bunch of pieces of whatever you are using for your fringe.

Most things you find may not be long enough to weave back and forth using a long piece like you would with wood or thread. Here is how I dealt with each circumstance.\nSingle Length strands\nSome of the materials I had only just reached from one side of the warp to the other. The sections of palm leaf I had I threaded through and left the ends poking out. This worked at the bottom of the piece because I was trying to make it look all wild and fluffy round the bottom! If you don't want pieces poking out you can either fold them back and try and tuck them into the warp at the back (can be difficult with the stiffer leaves) or trim them off once you are finished - not too close to the warp though!\nMore Than Single Length Strands\nSome of the longer pieces of the bark fibre were about 2.5 times the width of the warp , so I could go across and back, but on the third pass it finished in the middle. If a piece does not stretch all the way across you can end it midway by making sure the end pokes out the back. You then thread a new piece onto your needle and start threading your new piece in so it overlaps a little with the old one. The ends can either be left, or tucked in with a needle later.\nNot Quite Single Length Stands\nThese tended to be the bulkier items like the pampas grass fronds and the evergreen leaves. In both cases I made sure I was on a left to right weft so I didn't need to thread these pieces in manually. I found a couple of pieces that would stretch across nicely, and wouldn't make too much of a lump in the middle, then slipped them into the shed - sometimes one from each end.\nGaps and Beating\nIn every case you need to use your fork to beat the weft down so that you don't end up with gaps. I found the green palm fronds were very reluctant to be beaten down and then proceeded to shrink so I was left with a couple of spaces in the final product! Something to keep in mind when using green materials...\nWarp Colour\nYou may notice that the warp changes colour part way though my weaving. I did this using a normal teabag with a bit of hot water on it - wait for it to steep a bit then dab or carefully rub the teabag on the warp threads where you want a darker shade.\nWarp Spacing\nThe other issue I encountered with the natural fibres is that they don't naturally 'slide' into the warp. They grab a hold and drag that warp threads all over the place. I was constantly (with varying states of success) using the fork to drag the warp back into nice even spaces. The dowel at the top helps with this because it is always nice and even at the top!\nAs you weave make sure you are leaving yourself enough room at the top to tie off the warp.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2L/ZPU3/JTIYKFBN/F2LZPU3JTIYKFBN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBI/S533/JTIYKFC7/FBIS533JTIYKFC7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKV/5Y3N/JTIYKFCR/FKV5Y3NJTIYKFCR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKF/UUIA/JTIYKEOD/FKFUUIAJTIYKEOD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8T/JFQZ/JTIYKFDX/F8TJFQZJTIYKFDX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOS/UF1F/JTIYKEKJ/FOSUF1FJTIYKEKJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3L/8TDS/JTIYKELV/F3L8TDSJTIYKELV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXL/QHWZ/JTIYKFDC/FXLQHWZJTIYKFDC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDS/F147/JTIYKFHB/FDSF147JTIYKFHB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Weaving Your Art"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "There are a couple of things to do once you have finished weaving in order to complete your piece of art.\nTying off\nThis is to stop the weaving from falling apart.\nGently slide the cardboard out from the bottom of the loom and slip the warp threads off the nails.

I actually tied two loops together - wasn't as neat, but with the fringe at the top it didn't matter too much.\nOnce knotted you can snip off the loops - unless you want to use the ones at the top for hanging.\nTying in\nAll the loose ends need to be woven into the back of the weave. You can use a needle (a proper one - your popsicle stick may be to big for this!) to poke the threads thru the warp at the back, tucking the ends out of sight. As I mentioned previously the chunkier ends might have to just be trimmed as close as you dare.\nTucking in\nI collected a bunch of little twigs and bits of seaweed that I tucked under the warp threads where I wanted them for added colour and texture.\nHanging\nYou can use all or some of the top loops to hang your piece.

It's a stretchy black synthetic knit with a metallic foil finish on one side, and it matches the fishscale fabric I used to make this mermaid dress. My friend sent me a huge piece of it because she rocks, and I decided to use some of it to make this swimsuit cover-up I'd had in my head for a while.\nMy idea was that I'd use fabric strips to weave a tube that was large enough to fit around my whole body, kind of like one of those Chinese finger traps, and leave a couple of strips longer than the rest so that I could use them as straps to hold the dress up.\nSince you end up with a tube, it has no front or back, so you can spin the dress around to make the straps fall wherever you want, and therefore you have a bunch of different options for how you style the straps.\nYou can vary the length, width, and number of fabric strips to change the size of the dress, or even use this method to make a top or a skirt. I will give you all of the measurements that I used, and you can use them or modify them to make a dress of your own!\nNote: This isn't really a beginner project... stretchy fabric can be hard to work with if you haven't used it before. And swimwear fabric in particular is pretty slippery. But I'll give you all the tips I can, and if you don't feel like you're ready to work with stretchy fabric yet, you can practice by using strips of upcycled denim jeans to make a bath mat using the same method. Denim is a lot easier to work with, and readily available. If you do the denim thing, you need to use a size 16 sharp needle (it might be called a size 100 regular, depending on where you live, or it might even be called a jeans needle. They're all the same thing) instead of the stretch needle I'm using for the swimsuit fabric.", "title": "Swimsuit Cover-Up Made With Woven Strips of Fabric", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Swimsuit-Cover-Up-Made-With-Woven-Strips-of-Fabric/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The fabric I'm using is a black poly/spandex knit with a metallic foil finish on one side. It's very stretchy, and was made for dance and swim wear. If you're making a dress that's not for swimming, you don't have to be as choosy about the fabric, but it's important to note that the completed dress will be a cylindrical tube, and whatever you use needs to stretch enough that you can get in and out of it, and still have it conform to your body in a comfortable, flattering way.\nYou can absolutely use two different fabrics to make the weave pattern even more pronounced, but they should be similar to each other in thickness and stretch, so that they aren't fighting with each other once you put them together into the dress.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0X/0GHC/JTIYNWEY/F0X0GHCJTIYNWEY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Choose Your Fabric"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "If your fabric only stretches in one direction, you should cut the strips so that they are stretchy from side to side, and not down the length of the strip. I used a little less than one yard of 60\" (150 cm) wide fabric, but my fabric was very stretchy in both directions. For a fabric that only stretches in one direction, I would recommend buying at least a yard and a half, so that you can cut long enough pieces to make the straps.\nMost of the strips that I used were 4\" wide by 29\" long (10 cm by 74 cm), and two of them were 58\" long, so that I could use the extra length as straps to hold the dress up. I used 14 strips in total: 7 that slanted to the left, and 7 that slanted to the right. I ended up with a tube that was 28\" in circumference.\nThe basic formula is (strip width) times (the number of strips slanting in each direction) equals (the width your finished panel will be). So, 4\" X 7 = 28\". You probably want the width of the finished panel to equal at least the measurement around your waist. But your fabric might be more or less stretchy than mine was, or you might prefer a looser or tighter fit, so I can't give you exact measurements, only that general guideline.\nIf you wanted to change the size or length of the swimsuit cover-up, you can make the strips wider or use more strips, and that will give you a larger dress. Make the strips narrower, or use fewer strips, and that will give you a smaller dress. You can use longer strips to make a longer dress, or use shorter strips if you want to make just a top or a skirt.\nYou need to have the same number of strips slanting in each direction. So if you want a wider panel, you have to add two strips: one that leans left, and one that leans right.\nYou may want to cut 4 of the strips longer, so that you have more strap options on the finished dress, and you can always trim off any that you decide not to use.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ8/1DX0/JTIYNWJC/FQ81DX0JTIYNWJC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXS/7F4L/JTIYO6MZ/FXS7F4LJTIYO6MZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Cut the Fabric Into Strips"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I recommend laying out all of your strips and weaving them together without gluing or sewing anything at first, to make sure that the garment will end up the right size once you are done.\nI laid out two strips to begin with, the long ones that were going to become the straps. I ignored the extra length for now, and pretended that they were only as long as the other straps. I made an X shape with them, and placed them with the ends 6\" (15 cm) away from each other. Add strips parallel to the two long strips, going under-over-under-over the opposite strips in a basic plain weave. If the previous strip went under a crossing strip, the next strip goes over, and vice versa.\nThe bottom points were all aligned along a straight line (the edge of your table works great.) I made sure to line up the bottom points, and not the top, because I was planning to leave the bottom edge of the skirt with the strips hanging free, just like they were woven, and hem the top. So I wanted the bottom edge to be evenly lined up, but I wasn't really worried about making sure the top edge looked tidy yet.\nRandom note: When I was starting to work out the pattern, my goofball brother photobombed me.

You do want to use a ballpoint (stretch) needle, or you may end up with skipped stitches. I'm using a size 11 (which may be called size 75, depending on where you live), but if your fabric is thicker you can use a size 14 (aka size 90).\nI sewed all of the seams from the right side (the top, pretty side of the panel), about 1/4\" (half a centimeter) away from the edge of each top strip, to attach it to the strip it was crossing over. I used a straight stitch, but a zigzag would be a good choice too. Sew in reverse for a couple of stitches at the beginning and end of each seam, to fasten your stitches in place.\nI chose to start with two strips, sew one seam at time, and then lay the dress out flat again and work on the next seam. You may decide to weave together all of the strips at once, and then sew every seam one right after another. That might work out well with a less-slippery fabric, but it didn't really seem practical for the fabric I chose.\nI decided to use this temporary spray adhesive to spray each strip that I was about to sew, to make sure it stayed exactly where I wanted it while I was sewing. Again, if your fabric isn't as difficult, you might not need to do this, but it's a helpful tip to use if you run into trouble with the fabric shifting. The adhesive makes your fabric tacky, like the sticky part of a post-it note, and then disappears on its own in a few days, so you don't have to worry about globs of glue hanging around or gunking up on your needle.\nSpray only the part of the strip that will be covered up when you lay the next strip down. You can use pieces of paper to protect the rest of the strip and your table from overspray. You don't want the part with the adhesive on it to be against your presser foot or the bed of your machine, because of course it will stick to them.\nA couple of times I had a space-out moment, and sprayed the adhesive on the wrong side of the fabric strip. When that happened, I put strips of paper over the sticky area to keep the fabric from sticking to the presser foot, and sewed through the paper and fabric at the same time. Then I tore the paper away after I'd finished sewing the seam. But it's easier to just pay attention in the first place. :-)\nP.S. The link to the spray adhesive is an affiliate link, so I will earn a small commission (at no extra cost to you) if you use that link to make a purchase.

Just weave and sew them like you did with the other strips, and they should all fit into each other perfectly.\nThe last few seams will be a tiny bit more difficult to sew, since you're working with a tube now, instead of a flat panel. But just take a second each time before you sew, to make sure that you're not catching the bottom layer in your stitching and sewing the back of the tube to the front.

(Tie them together before you wrap them around your neck, or else it will get uncomfortably tight around your throat. Knotting them together first puts all of the pressure on your shoulder instead.) Or tie them together behind your neck and make halter straps. You can criss-cross them, or twist them. It's up to you.\nYou can also pass them over your shoulders and sew them to the other side of the dress, like tank top straps.

I have divided the poster into 4 basic layers with a gap of 10 mm between each layer. so that gives me a width of 40 mm. Then, I've added some wooden end stops for supporting the light and the poster from either sides as shown which take about 10 mm\nThen, the lights alone take about 40 mm including the adapter.\nand then finally, the front of the whole frame is a bit higher than the poster so about 10 mm more.

These LEDs are pretty cheap and you can get them at any local electrical or hardware store.\nNext, you need to provide an offset so that your led's dont land on the wooden standoffs installed in the frame. I've given an offset of 20 mm.\nAfter that, divide the area into multiple sections so that the strip width(mine was 5 mm) fits in them (I divided them into 10 kinda equal parts). The LED strips usually have a glue back, so they can glued to the mdf board by cutting them (A scissor mark will be shown along the LED strip that you buy indicating the places at which it can be cut. usually, its after 3 LEDs). Cut the strips according to the length and marks and stick them to the mdf either by using their own glue or by using a glue gun. Normal adhesives dont usually work on mdf as it is highly absorbent.\nNow, the connections. LEDs are connected in parallel, meaning, all the positives of the strips are connected and so are the negatives, which are then connected to the positive and negative output of the adaptor respectively. It is shown in the second figure.\nNow connect the adaptor and check if it works.

Your paper might have a weight (specified in some weight per area unit) that you can compare to your printer's specs. If your printer has a special feed tray for thick paper, use that. If your printer jams up, you can always find a local print shop that will print your paper for a small fee.\nAnother thing you want to double check before printing all of your paper is that you are printing on the correct side of the paper. Some colored and patterned paper have different things on each side. If you have certain colors or patterns you want to be visible, the cut and fold lines need to be on the back of the paper. It is a good idea to send a test sheet of paper through with something written on one side so that you know which side of the paper your printer prints on.\nOnce you've worked these details out, shuffle up your paper and send it through the printer.

I also recommend downloading Pepakura and using it to figure out what sheet of paper a piece is on. It also really helps to see the 3d model when deciding what piece to do next. The free version of Pepakura should allow you to view the model and see what sheet a piece is on.\nIf you are on a Mac or Linux machine, look into installing wine (the software, not the drink!) on your machine. I was able to get Pepakura to run on my Macbook with wine.\nCutting\nWhen cutting out your pieces, only cut along solid lines.\nThe cutting blades will dull out throughout the project, and having a sharp blade makes the process much quicker and easier. I recommend having some spare blades to swap out as you progress through the project.\nFolding\nDashed lines are valley folds. Dash-dot lines are mountain folds. (See the above photo if you aren't sure which is which).\nUsing a straight edge to help with getting precise fold lines is a must. I've heard of some people useing the back of their xacto knife to help score the fold lines. I didn't do this, but you can give it a try to see if it helps for you.\nTaping\nTry to assemble the small intricate edges before doing big, easy ones. It sucks when you need to get to a small flap, but your piece is locked in by another taped flap that prevents you from easily maneuvering around.\nWork your way from the front to the back on each body part.

Each new piece of tape should cover half the width of the previous piece (picture 1). Keep the tape taut as you lay it down and use your free hand to smooth it into place. Press down on each piece to remove air bubbles and to ensure that the tape adheres completely.\nPull up the sheet, starting with the initial layer (picture 2). Note: If you start with the top layer, you may accidentally split the sheet in half.\nFlip the sheet over, hold it in place with very small pieces of tape so it doesn\u2019t shift, and finish the reverse side in the same way as the first (picture 3). Work slowly and deliberately: It\u2019s difficult to adjust a long piece of tape once the two adhesive surfaces are stuck together. If a mistake does occur, smooth it out as best as you can, and consider applying another layer of tape to cover the imperfections.\nTrim the uneven edges with a rotary tool (picture 4).

These instructions include a step-by-step, image-guided process for making pom-poms at home. We\u2019ve also included four additional sets of instructions for some possible at-home projects using your new, fun, and colorful pom-poms!\nPom-poms\nMaterials Needed:\n-Yarn\nMost types and textures of yarn will work well for this project. Keep in mind that for a thinner yarn, a significant amount of more yarn will be required in order to make a more full pom-pom. If an ultra-plush or thicker yarn is being used, we recommend using a larger sized pom-pom maker. If you desire stiffer pom-poms, use a more structured yarn; for floppier pom-poms, use a thinner yarn.\n-Standard pom-pom maker\nStandard pom-pom makers are typically under ten dollars and can be found at most craft stores. Keep in mind that the devices come in various sizes. Each pom-pom maker makes only one size of pom-pom that will be relatively the same size as the device itself.\n-Fabric scissors\nThe right scissors are very important in this craft. Sharpened fabric scissors will produce the most clean-cut and fluffy pom-poms.

This helps make sure the interior depth of the bases are made precisely as needed (see photo 1).\nFor the back piece of the frame I used oak, and the thickness used depended on the style of hinges I planned to use for that case (so some photos show a thicker doubled-up piece, and others show a thinner piece).\nThe remaining pieces of the base are made from 9mm plywood, with the sides layered to create a lip that registers the top cover piece in place.\nThe frame pieces are 3\" and 1 3/4\" tall respectively, and cut to length as needed to create the interior opening sized as noted above.\nAll of these pieces were cut using a table saw for long cuts, and table saw with cross-cut sled to cut them to length.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNU/3F33/JT4TVU9C/FNU3F33JT4TVU9C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIR/TE9R/JT4TVTTR/FIRTE9RJT4TVTTR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Base Measurements"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The pieces for the inside layer of the base were glued and nailed together using a brad nailer, as shown.\nA bottom piece was then cut and glued/nailed in place.\nThen the outer frame pieces were added in the same fashion.

From past 3-4 weeks, I am researching on engraving and I found myself so much attraction towards this work that I decided to step into this new kind of work. I saw many companies selling the set of gravers but overall in the end if you are going to use them then you definitely need to sharpen them again because their sharpness not going to last long because if you are a beginner then I think you are definitely going to break a lot of tip during your work and for that you need to sharpen that graver and there is no doubt that you are not getting the exact angle you need to grave the metal surface. so by considering this thing in my mind I decided to make a set of gravers completely out of scratch and decided to share my experience to other so that anyone who is fascinating about doing this new work can easily able to master this technique. This doesn't seem hard to make the graver shape but if you don't have power honing wheel then this will take a lot of elbow grease to make the set. I am also in one of them who don't have power honing wheel. Some of the things are easier for you to understand in the video part so I definitely recommend you to watch that as well and if you himself a master engraver saying this video on this instructable and found anything wrong then let me know in the comment section so that I am able to update that and everybody knows about that mistake.

If you want to make a set of graver then you definitely not going to use the normal carbon Steel. You need a material which is going to hold it edge for a long time. If you compare normal carbon steel to the high-speed Steel and pay some attention to the composition then you find that high-speed Steel has some different composition. It contains a different kind of element like chromium vanadium molybdenum tungsten so these kinds of material provide much resistance towards aberration so that the reasons why high-speed steel is preferred to make the gravers. Other than that you can use tungsten carbide blanks for making a set of the graver. The only downfall of carbide is that it is very brittle than high-speed Steel but on the other side it going to hold the edge for a longer time. Many master engravers told that if you are beginners in engraving then it's better to use high-speed Steel as a graver as compared to carbide because carbide is less forgiving. So father material you have only two options either to go with high speed steel or you can go with carbide.in my case I go with both of the material to take a look that what amount of difference is in both the material and even if you were beginner in the engraving you will notice the difference between both the materials. And I found that difference during my first attempt at engraving. For the engraving surface I am using mild steel and the stool I am using is made up of carbide 90 degrees graver and during my first three-four lines I break the carbide graver 7 times and then I switch the graver to onglette graver which is made up of high-speed steel and also more forgiving towards the smaller corners. few hours I practice with the outlet graver to make myself comfortable with this new kind of work and once again some confidence I switch the graver bit to the carbide and succeeded as some extent even though I am still breaking the tip of the gravers but the number 7 which was in the first attempt decreases to 1 and I think with the passage of sometimes this number decreases and came down to 0.\nMaterial used:-\n1.

Here are some parameters you can follow:-\n1. For softer material angles from 30\u00b0- 40\u00b0 works\n2. For mostly used material angle from 40\u00b0- 50\u00b0 works\n3.

The importance of heel is to prevent the graver dive deep into the material surface", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: Parameters Used in Graver Making"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Before making the graver trample our need to know about different kinds of size, shapes of gravers. In my research, I found that many Japanese master engravers made a bunch of their own set of gravers which doesn't even exist in the books. From that research I learned that it's completely depends upon you that how you can solve your problem. This thing completely depends upon your problem solving techniques. If you saw a person named Ford Half Japanese metalwork you may learn how many different kinds of gravers need to make to solve the problem if normal graver didn't work at that stage. So before jumping to the designing section, I would like to tell you about different kinds of commonly used gravers which I am going to made in this Instructables and their uses.\nV-Point Gravers have a diamond-shaped face but with a sharper cutting angle. They're used for removing background material, shading, cutting borders and star shapes, and for raising beads for stone setting. So all the gravers whose angles vary from 70, 90, 96, 105, 110, 120 & 130 degrees come in v point gravers. Each person prefers different gravers, but what I experienced in my first attempt is that gravers having angles less than 90 degrees are more likely to break or chip. You have to be a little careful about these gravers.\nFlat Gravers have a flat cutting edge with either parallel or slightly tapered sides. They're useful for removing or texturing backgrounds, bright-cutting, block lettering, and cutting consistent width lines for borders. The flat gravers with the slightly tapered sides also are used for inlay work.\nRound Gravers have a round cutting edge with either parallel or slightly tapered sides. They're used primarily for raising and rolling beads for stone setting or cutting smooth curves when engraving or chasing.\nOnglette Gravers have a cutting edge that comes to a fine point and curved sides. They're used for stone setting, line engraving, lettering, and inlay work. Perfect for cutting smooth curves and fine lines.\nOval Gravers have an oval-shaped face with a curved cutting edge. They're useful for shading curved surfaces, deep cutting, and for some styles of block lettering. They're also used for raising and rolling beads for stone setting.\nKnife Gravers have straight sides that taper to a very sharp point. They produce deep, narrow cuts making them great for fine-line engraving and for removing excess metal from around stone settings.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7K/29R7/JTEN35ZX/F7K29R7JTEN35ZX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1M/JQ5B/JTEN35GV/F1MJQ5BJTEN35GV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRI/ARM0/JTEN35JR/FRIARM0JTEN35JR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1I/1T9G/JTEN35X2/F1I1T9GJTEN35X2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBN/7S1I/JTEN3588/FBN7S1IJTEN3588.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEM/LQCG/JTEN35US/FEMLQCGJTEN35US.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Commonly Used Gravers"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "So the crucial step in making a set of graver is how you can make your templates. Because these are the only thing with which you are able to follow the profile and transfer it on to the graver. The process of making the template is very easy and to illustrate you I am going to upload a set of pictures describing how you can make doors template. So there are few things which going to play an important role in increasing or decreasing the size of the template. Because largest the size of the template, more will be easy to follow that profile precisely, and smaller the template difficult to do your job. as far as gravers are concerned there are two different kinds of graver one are those in which you are using a hand-held hammer to cut down the material surface and second are those in which you use some kind of power tool to remove the material. In my case, I am using foredom to do the job and for the tool attachment, I'm using number 15 hammer handpiece. The link for all of those are in the tools section. So there are few things you need to be considered while designing a graver template as follow:-\n1. Length of the graver:-\nGraver plays an important role in designing the template because if you are using hammer and chisel engraving technique then you can kept your graver length quite long as compared to the pneumatic or handheld have a piece which are work with some Power tools because the graver which you are using along with some Power tools need small graver blank for the cutting action because the tool holder itself has some length and if you are keeping your gravers too long then it would be very difficult for you to do your job. On the other hand, if you are using hammer and chisel technique in which you need to strike the hammer on to the graver back, in that case, you can get the graver length long enough because you have to hold that in your hand and strike with the hammer. You cannot use smaller graver with hammer and chisel technique because it is very difficult to hold that graver and follow the path to cut down the material so that's why I am saying that length of the graver place the important role in designing the template. Longer the length of the graver more will be the area you have to hold the graver to its place during the sharpening process in the templates.\n2. Thickness of the sending block:-\nThe thickness of sending block also plays an important role while designing the template because more will be the thickness of your sending plate the more will be the height needed to keep that phase angle and as a result, a larger template is going to be constructed. So it is difficult for me to illustrate you with just simple writing about the template making process so that's why I am going to upload a set of pictures which will clarify you how you can make the graver template and what are the factors you needed to know while designing your templates. If you did not understand in this phase then I would recommend you to watch the video I think that will clarify your doubt on this part of the project.\n3. Face angle of the graver:-\nFace angle of the graver is another important part of designing the graver template. The face angle varies from 30-60 degree. The bigger the angle is the more will be the height of the template and vice versa.\nTo make the template first draw a box equal to the length and thickness of your grinding stone or plate. Then you have to draw a line whose length is equal to G mm (see Image 2) at an angle which lies between 30-60 degree. This usually depends upon the type of material onto which you have to engrave. For most of the material 45-degree angle works. Then draw a perpendicular at the end of the G towards the table surface and measure that distance which is X mm (see Image 2). Repeat the step for heel as well by taking the angle from 15-20 degree with the same length G mm which we used earlier we got length Y mm. Now we have two lengths having distance known for both sides. Now draw a horizontal line on a paper and draw perpendicular onto it. At X mm distance draw a circle where you need to drill the hole for the graver holder. After that extend that line to Ymm more. That is going to make the heel. The tip of the Y mm is the Point where the graver tip is going to be reached. Then make the required shape and angle by considering that point as the extreme end and everything you have to draw needs to remain below that point. This is how your face and heel can be formed. The same process has to be repeated with the clearance template the angle varies from 5-8 degree. If it seems too step then lower the angle. If you don't want to use this template then try to use thinner material like near about 2 mm. That case, you don't need a smaller template.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLO/NUVT/JTEN35M7/FLONUVTJTEN35M7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD4/5B0V/JTEN35NR/FD45B0VJTEN35NR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZH/RNUZ/JTEN35SJ/FZHRNUZJTEN35SJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F65/AAAS/JTEN3BR3/F65AAASJTEN3BR3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Designing the Templates"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The alignment hole is also one of the necessary parts in designing the template because this is the only thing which helps you to align the graver and lockdown to its place at exact position in each attempt in different graver templates. So the location of the hole can be made anywhere on the template you want but the main point to be noted that the hole was not too far from the graver holder reach. If you Mark the hole location too far then the graver holders will not be going to lock down and you are ended up with the nasty result. Other things also taking care of while marking the alignment hole is that the location needed to be the same position in all of the templates because the dimension and the graver holder is same for all of the templates and if you make this alignment hole wrongly then you are ended up with inconsistent grind and that is not good for engraving. It is always good to design the whole location according to the smallest template because if you design it according to the longer template and made it to for then there might be a chance that the hole appears out of the smaller templates. So these are the few things you need to know about this alignment hole.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFA/H1B8/JTEMZSFQ/FFAH1B8JTEMZSFQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Making the Alignment Hole in the Template"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Once the design phase of the template has been finished the only thing left is to make them for use. For that, I glue the templates onto a piece of acrylic. For the acrylic, I am using cast acrylic because it works well on to the scroll saw because it did not melt during the cutting process. so I would definitely recommend preferring cast acrylic over the extruded acrylic because cast gives you a better result. So once the templates have been glued onto the acrylic I mark the hole location with a spring loaded center punch and I am very careful during this process because the tiny amount of misalignment can affect my graver final outcome. Then I cut all of the templates onto my scroll saw. Here I tried my best to get as close as possible as I can because this is also the first time I am using this scroll saw and the quality of cut completely blew my mind. I highly recommend this kind of power tool in the workshop. Since it's my first project with the scroll saw the cuts are slightly wiggly because of the lack of experience and to remove that wiggle I use a set of needle files to do that work. I hold them into my vice and then carefully reached to the final lines what I needed. This is definitely not the accurate method but if you pay some attention to this then you will achieve closest to that accuracy. You can use CNC or laser cutter for this project. The 3d printer also is a good option for making these templates. So go whatever you find easy. So once the templates are completely finalize the only thing left is to drill the holes. So as I described earlier there are going to be two holes one for the graver holder and second for the holder alignment. For the holder, I am going to drill 10 mm hole because I am using 10 mm bolt for the holder lock down onto the template and for the alignment hole I go with 3mm hole because I am using 3mm grub screws. So at this stage, the templates are ready to use.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQQ/Y7TQ/JTEMZSL6/FQQY7TQJTEMZSL6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSD/6KDV/JTEMZSLD/FSD6KDVJTEMZSLD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYW/AG7C/JTEMZSLH/FYWAG7CJTEMZSLH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZG/RCYB/JTEMZSM6/FZGRCYBJTEMZSM6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFU/HU4W/JTEMZSMB/FFUHU4WJTEMZSMB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFN/AGZ6/JTEMZSME/FFNAGZ6JTEMZSME.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKN/9ZDN/JTEN0MXI/FKN9ZDNJTEN0MXI.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0E/YPRF/JTEN0OFA/F0EYPRFJTEN0OFA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCS/JMTS/JTEN0OJU/FCSJMTSJTEN0OJU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDC/AYCO/JTEN0OJV/FDCAYCOJTEN0OJV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGX/FYXG/JTEN0OP3/FGXFYXGJTEN0OP3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4R/249R/JTEN0OYB/F4R249RJTEN0OYB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Making the Template's"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "So this one is also the most time-consuming process in this build and the main reason for this is that I made 6 unsuccessful tries and then able to make this final version. But even then if I compared this with the finishing I am definitely not happy that much but I think if you have a lack of tools then you have to compromise at some place. So come onto the building section of this holder I cut down \u00be\u201d piece of round stock and I roughly cut down it to around 1\u201d in length. Then with the help of center finding jig, I marked the center onto this stock and repeat the same procedure onto the back side also. Then I first use 3mm drill to make the pilot hole and I approach the same thing from both sides drill the hole from the back side since the dimensions of the graver blank is 4mmX4mm and therefore I drill a 4mm hole. Once the 4mm hole has been drilled throughout at one of its ends I drilled 8mm hole and that is used to make the tap for m10 bolt which I am going to fit inside this holder blank. Once the tap has been made inside that hole I made a test piece and insert it into the jig. And everything seems to be work fine. Then I hold that holder into the vice and drill through the hole into that so that graver blank can be put inside that hole. Onto the threaded portion, I drilled a slightly larger hole so that no additional work needs to be done on that side. Since I drill a 4mm hole and the 4mm square graver blank not going to fit inside that hole so I hold that holder into the vice and start filling down the hole to a square section until the graver blank fits inside that hole. Once this thing is achieved I made a mark perpendicular to one of the square faces and the main reason to do this is to make a locking mechanism for the holder to lock down the graver to its place during the grinding process of the graver blank. Once the mark is done I center punch and drill the hole and then make the thread with the m4 tap. Now comes the tricky part that's why I said that it's good to use lathe machine for this process. So to remove the bulkiness of the holder I hold it inside the drill and then grind the taper but making sure not to remove too much of the material because out of 19 mm 10 mm is used by that bolt and in the remaining material we need to provide some space and drill hole for the 3 mm grub screw and that thing also need some space. So this kind of things you need to take care of while grinding the taper. Another thing you need to remember that the portion where you make a tap for 4mm hold down, don't grind that area too much otherwise the number of thread decreases and you are not able to hold your graver in the holder. One thing also to suggest you that if the holder seems bigger for some of the templates then change the angle in the design and remake the template, you can also change the hole position of the holder slightly down where your grinding is not disturbed by that holder. So you can say this is a little bit of try and error. In my case, I grind that holder into a triangular shape so that it will not come in the way of grinding plate. I also remove the bulkiness of the nut as well I hold it into the drill and then grind the surface to make it round in shape.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIW/FONB/JTEN0P8Z/FIWFONBJTEN0P8Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEP/38X3/JTEN0PA1/FEP38X3JTEN0PA1.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0A/9MRT/JTEN0X97/F0A9MRTJTEN0X97.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8F/TP42/JTEN0X9C/F8FTP42JTEN0X9C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLW/DF7E/JTEN0X9E/FLWDF7EJTEN0X9E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F52/ZC5R/JTEN0X9G/F52ZC5RJTEN0X9G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F26/PI7N/JTEN0X9I/F26PI7NJTEN0X9I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F82/MBK9/JTEN0X9M/F82MBK9JTEN0X9M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCX/3P3M/JTEN0X9Q/FCX3P3MJTEN0X9Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV3/F5XR/JTEN0X9R/FV3F5XRJTEN0X9R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHO/IV1F/JTEN0X9S/FHOIV1FJTEN0X9S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXE/BQL4/JTEN0XA0/FXEBQL4JTEN0XA0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR7/WW5G/JTEN0XA2/FR7WW5GJTEN0XA2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIE/FOWP/JTEN0XA7/FIEFOWPJTEN0XA7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKD/FOT5/JTEN0XAB/FKDFOT5JTEN0XAB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIW/8NMS/JTEN0XAG/FIW8NMSJTEN0XAG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3X/H3RG/JTEN0XAL/F3XH3RGJTEN0XAL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Making the Graver Holder"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "this is the easiest part of this build and what you need to do is hold the graver holder into the jig and insert the graver blank inside the holder and lock down the graver to its place inside that holder.

For cutting, I use two different methods. In first I use foredom and a diamond wheel to cut down the graver blank but the one wheel completely wear off to cut down one blank. So I approached a different technique. I grind the line around the perimeter or the graver with the help of diamond file and then hold it as closer to that line in the vice. Then apply a little amount of force to break it in half. It is very easy to snap this in half but to get a good cut you need to scour the line around all four sides.

Unfortunately, I didn't make any- so here are some after-the-fact! (Refer to the pdf- I don't recommend it as a template, but it will give you a sense or placement and proportion.)\nI started by cutting a knife shape and the handle form on the band saw. The initial knife shape was pretty straightforward- \"blade\" with a long tail that will work well as a handle and lever, and \"handle\" with holes to serve as a pivot point, and a slot for the tail piece.\nThe center rectangle should be about the width of the thickness of your knife metal, plus a little extra for washers. The placement of the holes was tricky- I found a good spot by cutting out my knife piece and kind of imagining how it would pivot. You want the blade to be completely covered by the brass when \"sheathed\" (rotated in) and you want as much blade as possible when rotated out.\nConsider printing and cutting out the pdf drawings, putting a pin through the holes, and seeing how it all fits together- you can make your own custom template this way, too.\nWe all make mistakes.\nZoom in on the brass. See how both sides of the handle have double dimples? I couldn't decide where to put the hole, so I marked the spot twice. At least I didn't drill it.

I did this by using a ball peen hammer to make dimples in the surface of the brass that would face out. Once the brass gets too hard, don't try to force it- heat it until it turns a dull red, then throw it in water (quench it). This is called annealing, and it's a process by which metal is relaxed to become more workable.\nEither before or after texturing, drill holes for the hinge in the handle. The important thing is that they are symmetrical to each other across the center line of the handle. To drill a perfectly sized hole, measure the piece of rod you're using with calipers or a micrometer, and use a drill bit with the same diameter. If you don't have a ton of drill bits, that's fine! Go for the next closest size up.\nOnce your handle is satisfactory, fold it! There are a number of ways to do this- I clamped mine and bent it around a ninety degree corner, then again around a piece of metal with a thickness that I liked. Take it slow- if it gets wonky (it did for me) and the holes become misaligned, anneal it, and work it a little more. Hole alignment and having the slot in the middle of the handle are the most important bits.\nEDIT\nWhen you have the drill press set up to drill your handle, go ahead and drill your pivot point in your blade blank too.

Once you have your blade cut out, and a hole drilled where you want it, approach the grinder (with confidence- you are gonna own this grind). Practice on some metal first, to get a sense of angle and control.\nI like to hold a work piece in some Vice Grips- you don't have to, but if you don't, dunk it frequently so it stays cool and holdable. I encourage you to research bevel types, but if you're lazy like me, here's a crash course.\nThe bevel is the \"blade\" part of a blade, where it goes from the thickest part (the spine) the the thinnest (the edge). There's loads of types of bevels, which we won't get into. A great, functional, and simple bevel is the flat bevel- a flat transition from the spine to the edge.\nTo grind, hold your work piece at an angle against the grinder. The angle your hold your work piece at will be mirrored by the grind- I like to grind nice and long, almost as if I'm just pressing the flat of the blade against the grind, but at the slightest angle. Make sure the edge doesn't look wonky- you want it to taper to the tip but still be sharp along the whole length.\n\nGrinding is an art, to be learned by doing. If you want this knife to be perfect, practice on scrap metal a lot. This is my fifth or sixth knife, so I'm just starting to feel good about my grinds. Find photos of knives you like and try to emulate those.\nI start with a 60 or 80 grit sandpaper, and move up to 120, then, 320 or 400 off the grinder.

Make sure you can heat the knife without setting anything on fire.\nFirst we harden. Apply heat to the blade until it all turns an even, cherry red- I like to start at the spine, so by the time it's hot enough the thinner blade will be ready, too. As soon as you evenly achieve this color, quickly dunk the whole knife in oil. Stir it around, watching out for flames. After a couple stirs, take it out and make sure it's straight. Small bends can be gently corrected. Use the table vice to grip the blade, and very slowly reverse any kinks- check your work frequently, since you only have about ten seconds. If there are still bends after that window closes, thats okay! Reheat the blade to cherry red and then let it air cool.

As you slide the mask, it cycles through the four frames, giving the illusion of motion.\nThe downside of this technique is that the mask is mostly dark, so the more frames in the animation, the darker it will make the animation look.

For those who are interested, the \".scad\" files are attached.\nI then used the GIMP to create a custom 20x20 pattern that consisted of one line of white pixels and three lines of black pixels repeated five times. This pattern was used for the mask. I installed this into my GIMP patterns directory as a custom pattern (see tutorial here or see the pre-made \"four-frames.pat\" file that I attached).\nI then opened the four animation frames I exported from OpenSCAD into GIMP using the \"Open as Layers...\" feature. I changed the mode of the images to \"Indexed Color\" and selected the 1-bit B&W palette. I changed the resolution of the image to 150 dpi, so that it would print okay on a 300 dpi laser printer.\nFor each layer, I right clicked and selected \"Add Layer Mask...\" and then checked \"Show Layer Mask\" for each layer. I used the Bucket Fill tool to fill each layer mask with the custom mask pattern. The mask makes it so just one line out of every four will be shown, with the others masked out.\nIt is then necessary to stagger the masks so that each layer contributes a different line. I zoomed the document to 800%, scrolled to the top of the image, and used the Move Tool to move the white row of pixels in the 1st mask to the 1st line of the image, to the 2nd line of pixels for the 2nd mask, to the 3rd line of pixels for the 3rd mask, and to the 4th line of pixels on the 4th mask. I then unchecked \"Show Layer Mask\" and \"Edit Layer Mask\" for each layer, giving me the composite image.\nThe resulting file was saved as \"greeting_card_template.xcf\".\nIf you want to make a new pattern, you can do so by opening that file. Right click each layer and select \"Disable Layer Mask\" for each layer. Also make sure \"Show Layer Mask\" and \"Edit Layer Mask\" are unchecked. You should now be able to switch from layer to layer and replace the gears with four new frames of your choosing. Then, re-enable the layer masks on each layer to make a composite image that interleaves all four frames.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 4: TL;DR: How I Generated the Pattern Using OpenSCAD and GIMP"}], "channel": "Paper"}, {"category": "Craft", "description": "When you were young, did you ever make little animations in the corners of your notebooks?

For the sake of this Instructable, we would like to achieve something similar to the ball dropping - nothing too complex but still very visually appealing.\nIf you are struggling to come up with an idea for your flipbook, I highly recommend starting with the ball animation (Picture 2).You can even use the photo I have here as a reference! It really drives home the principle of animation and it still looks fantastic once it is completed. Also, you don't have to worry about replicating different images over and over again, but rather just one image a couple of times.

If you want to make a grade school ball bouncing type book then there really isn't too much thought or complication to it. However, if you want movement, frame changing, or a story to be told through it, then its going to take some thought and planning.\nInspiration for these types of books can come from the simplest of places. For example, my internet this last week has had problems working and when that would happen, I would keep seeing this dinosaur pop up that we all know and sometimes love (he isn't always appearing under the most enjoyable circumstances). And when this little game would pop up, it would provide some momentary joy as your internet would try and find its way back from the twilight zone.\nI thought that it would be a fun idea to create mini-story out of it.\nWhatever you choose, make it your own! Your ideas could be based off of something or it could be something totally unique to you!

We don't want all of your hard work to be for nothing. Instead, make sure you are drawing on the right side of book. Also, be sure to leave a little space on the right so your thumb doesn't obscure any of the drawings as well. (This may not be an issue if you don't have massive thumbs like me ^^) (Picture 1)\nSecond - As you are drawing each individual page, make sure that you are numbering each page as you go in the corner. It really is so annoying if you accidentally mess up the order of the pages and spend hours of your time sorting through the minor differences to try and reconstruct the story. All of the time can be saved if you just simply number the backside corners of the pages as you go. This will not be visible as you are flipping through your book and if your pages ever get mixed up, it will be a simple fix. I had this happen to me several times as I was making my book so I highly recommend doing this. (Picture 2)\nThird - Create some drawings for any reoccurring patterns that you may encounter making your flipbook. In my case, the entire thing is a reoccurring pattern so I made sure to make a couple of initial highly detailed stencils of the ground, the dinosaur walking, the birds flapping, and the cacti so that I could use them without wasting time trying to meticulously draw each frame as neatly as I did the previous one. This will save you time and effort and will help you make your flipbook as fast and as neatly as possible. (Picture 3)\nFourth - Use a pencil and eraser when initially doing your drawings. I find that it is so much easier to correct a mistake rather than draw in pen and have to start over the whole frame again if you make a mistake. *Note* You may not have to do this if your flip book is simple enough.\nFifth - Have a mini storyboard to organize your thoughts. When you don't have a meaningful ending to the story, or a goal in sight, you tend to keep drawing and drawing without a specific ending in mind. If you do this, you will 9 times out of 10 quit early due to the magnitude of drawing left to complete the story or the amount of touch-ups you will have to do in the end. A good sized story without too much headache is around 50-150 frames. Any more than that and you are in for a long ride. Keep in mind though that my 130 page flip book was only 25 seconds so be sure to create a story then create a manageable structure for that story.\nNow that we have those general tips under our belts, let's get to the actual process of Illustrating the book.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FR4/GORM/JT91ICKB/FR4GORMJT91ICKB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP3/DFRT/JT91ICM3/FP3DFRTJT91ICM3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEQ/78K3/JT91IJKT/FEQ78K3JT91IJKT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Helpful Tips to Get Started"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Like I said before, there are some tips to get you working on the Illustrating of the book. These will save you a lot of time and effort. Depending on how long you want your story to be, you may have a lot of illustrating ahead of you. But no need to fear. Once you have your reference cards made, and your idea in place, you will start to develop a rhythm to your flipbook making. In other words, practice makes perfect.\nThe rhythm/pattern I follow for my flip book making is:\nWrite the next slide number in the top right back-side corner (So you don't mess up the order)\nTrace my next slide on top of the previous slide but shifted slightly (Picture 3)\nSet aside face down on the work surface and use the illustrated frame you just made as the template for the next frame.\nRepeat steps 1-3 from before until you are done. (Picture 4)\nOnce you have done this a couple of times, 2-3 frames side-by-side should look somewhat identical with slight variations.

This is my favorite part because you can really just relax, throw on some netflix and color. The book also starts to look really crisp and professional.\nI try to stick to black and white only when it comes to flip books because it can take a long time to color in. For example, my book took a tremendous amount of time to fill in all of the dinosaurs, the cacti and the birds. It would have taken far less time if it was just black and white with nothing filled in. It isn't a bad thing, it just depends on how much detail and time you want to put into your book.

You can achieve this by binding the pages together as tightly as you can. The length or duration of your book should determine what method you choose.\nThere are two main methods with four total methods that I am aware of. I will go over all of them starting with the two main ones. *Note*you can also use pre-punched paper and binding screws but those materials can be either slightly expensive or tough to find. We are doing this project on a \"pennies\" budget so we won't be using those materials.\nThe easiest method and themost time-efficient method is probably method 1.\n-This is simply just a result of binding the note cards together with two binding clips. This will create a tight connection and will make sure that the pages won't move out of place.\nThe second method was the method that I used for my own personal book. My book was about 130 total pages which is quite a lot of paper (Picture 6). If you have binding clips that large, I would still recommend using that method. However, since I didn't have those materials available to me, I used the gluing method.\n-To do this, you cut off a section of Index card (Picture 2) ensuring that it will overlap the bottom and top of the index cards you wish to bind (Picture 3). Next, you pre-fold the binding piece over the cards (Picture 4) and then you glue them (Picture 5). During this process, be sure to glue the back side of the papers. You can do this by running the glue stick along the edge of the papers. When you do this, each of the papers find their own little connections and just adds to the durability of book itself.\nThe third method is to take enough rubber bands pull them over onto the edges. However, I do not like this method because it doesn't apply well across all types of flip books. For example, if you book is a little bit shorter, your flip book will easily be bent by the stress of the rubber bands so I tend to stray from this method when I can.\nThe fourth method is to take duct tape and very tightly and carefully tape the edge of the book. Now this may sound easy, but depending on the size of your book, this could be difficult if you are worried about your pages shifting around as you are taping. So again, I tend to stray from this method.\nNow that you have found the binding method that is right for you, you should be 100% done with your book!

Not to mention I have always been terrified of scratching the screens themselves.

So in total, you have the top drawer, bottom drawer, and the box. I designed the box so the drawers would just slide in and out without guides but weren't loose enough to fall out if tipped on the side.\nOnce you've printed out the box, you can either prime it and paint it, or you can just take it as is. For me, I didn't want to paint it because of the additional steps involved it also has no effect as far as the functionality of the product itself. However, if that is something you are interested in, by all means paint away! :D Included in the design are also some notches that protrude out slightly on the top to be able to sustain the 5\" x 7\" pane of glass.\nGo ahead and slide the glass pane on to the top of those notches.

Pins need to be sharp too.\nThe finished bag has a base that measures about 27cm x 10cm (10\u00be\" x 4\") and it's 35cm (13\u00be\") tall, plenty big enough to carry a few unexpected purchases home.

This will be my second ever post on Instructable that I will be making and it is a much more updated and detailed version of my previous tutorial. So to start off I need to introduce myself. My name is Thomas Truong and I am a 19 yr old papermodel Artist from Melbourne Australia. I am also know as Hacaosuka Designs as some may have seen on Instagram. Although I spend my time in uni nowadays, I spend the rest of the hours building papermodels of peoples car which they commission. These end up being about 60cm long finished and they tend to become wall arts in someones home. My aim for these models is to make highly detailed 100% paper made model and making them one-offs where the files of each car is never released even at whatever price I receive.\nToday I will be going through the steps of how you could possible do the same for any car you want starting from the 3D modelling process to unfolding the model in Pepakura. Then editing of the templates in Photoshop and finally of course, printing and building the model itself.", "title": "How to Make Your Own Papermodel Car", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-Your-Own-Papermodel-Car/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "This is where you decide what car you want to model and build. Once decided, do the investigating of what images and angles you may need to get it as accurate as possible. Although the images are more of the modified car, its also good to just search up what a stock body one would look like also and this can help a lot even when there's cosmetics that may have hid the car of what it looks like originally. This can also be the part where you start looking for images you could use as texture later on e.g Headlights.\nAnother thing to look for is the blueprints of the car. This image includes the front, side, top, rear views of the car at a orthogonal perspective and also the width, height and length.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTC/0YLD/JT4TXZSS/FTC0YLDJT4TXZSS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUG/ZINN/JT4TY00F/FUGZINNJT4TY00F.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Decision and Image Searching"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "So for this stage, it doesn't really matter on what programs you have used before. Doesn't matter if you use Sketchup Pro, Blender or 3ds max, the same process applies to all. Although for people that haven't used any of these programs before I would recommend Google Sketchup due to its snap lock abilities making it easier for this kind of work. Although you have to pay for the program, there's the 30 day trial you could try out and I have added an extra thing for you at the end of this stage. :p\nhttps://www.sketchup.com/try-sketchup\nTo start of first, You need to set up the blueprints which you need to crop first so that each part is touching the edge of the border. For e.g wheels touching bottom border, roof touching the top e.t.c e.t.c Import the images as an Image.\n(Make sure the Camera is set to Parallel Projection by the way!)\nAnother thing to take note are those 3 lines. The green is the Y axis which moves back and forwards , The red is the X Axis which moves Left and Right and the Z axis moves up and down. Now that you know this, this is how you control your line. This can be done through your arrow keypads and will lock in the direction the line goes.\nNow align them as shown above. Now from here my preferable way is to start from the bonnet tracing the lines from the top view. Then once done move the bonnet up to the height of what the side view looks like. Check the front and make sure its aligned up and then continue the same step by starting the line from the bonnet and working your way around the whole car. You only have to make half the car as it can be duplicated and aligned up symmetrically through this step. Tap the 3 times to select the whole model, Right click and select make component, press create, and then CTRL drag the model. Finally flip the model by right clicking and selecting flip along components red and join the model. Now if you edit the right it will automatically edit the other side also.\nI have added a file below for those who want to see the linework (image 4) and want to connect the polygons themself.

Then drag the inner circle to the other side of the tire and tap the back side face and it should automatically remove the face leaving a wall.

Have something to help with rounding curves to give it its clean smooth bodywork. By having the same coloured texta you can hide the white edges of the templates making it look more realistic. Do full closed parts last for e.g the back wall of the tire which connects to the wheel arches. Superglue will be helpful in some circumstances also. Start with the front of your car and build all the way to the back. Then the underbody and finally other seperate parts such as the spoiler, wheels, side mirror e.t.c e.t.c\nNow that you know what to do, Go ahead! Try it out and once the model is done, apply a few layers of clear coat to give it that shiny finish! Go display on your bedroom wall or the living room next to your TV. The options are endless!

Any comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated.\n\nHigh Density PolyEthylene (HDPE) is one of the most commonly used plastics today, being used in a wide variety of items from tiny pill bottles to large barrels and water storage tanks. Chances are that in the last 24 to 48 hours you have carried groceries home in plastic shopping bags made of HDPE, drunk juice or milk from an HDPE jug, or pop from a bottle with an HDPE cap, thrown dirty clothes into a plastic clothes hamper made of HDPE, washed your hair with shampoo from an HDPE bottle, and thrown several HDPE jugs and bottles into a recycling box, also made of HDPE.\nI first got interested in recycling HDPE about a year and a half ago, after stumbling across a few videos on the subject. The idea of remelting HDPE intrigued me, doubly so, because the resulting blocks and sheets can be cut and worked with ordinary woodworking tools as easily as wood. (i.e. My bandsaw chews through HDPE as easily as the softest pine.)\nI have spent most of the last year doing only occasional melting experiments, without any clear projects to make from the resulting blocks. However, with Christmas coming up in a couple of months, three nieces to get presents for, and not a lot of money in my pocket to buy said presents, I have finally thought of a use for my HDPE.

It is a weaving technique used to create anything from jewelry to animals and boxes using beads, adding them one by one. This technique is very time-demanding and mastering it requires practice, time and patience. The real and fair price of the beadwoven jewelry easily equals that of jewelry made from precious metals. Even experienced jewelry makers need lots of time to make a piece and the quality material is not a cheap thing. Beadweaving uses several stitches, one of them being the peyote stitch that I will teach you in this tutorial. And I'll not just teach you the stitch, I'll also show you how to use it and make a flower, a ring and weave around a rivoli. You can choose any colors you like but in case you want to use the same like mine, there's a detailed description of the material used in the next step.", "title": "Beadweaving - the Flower Ring", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Beadweaving-the-Flower-Ring/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Material\n- beads - 2 sizes\n- beading needle\n- beading thread\n- rivoli\n- scissors\nQuality material is really important here. If you want to just try beadweaving and you are willing to accept that you might not like the result you can work with what you find at home - nameless beads and normal using thread. However, if you want to work smoothly and the result to be worth anything, you will have to invest into the material and tools. Check out the online stores with beading supplies and maybe there's even a shop in your town (in Czech Republic it is really easy to get quality beads and supplies especially in bigger cities).\nNeedles\nThe beading needles are different from usual sewing needles. They are very thin and don't get thicker around the eye, which makes it possible for them to pass through the beads. You can get them in many sizes marked with numbers. The higher the number, the thinner the needle. I use John James needles and as a general rule I'd say that for beads size 15 (Japanese) you need a needle size 15 and for beads size 11 you need a needle size 12.\nBeads\nIf you want to make quality jewelry, you just cannot use some cheap nameless beads. They tend to be very irregular, stain etc. Basically, you have two options - Czech or Japanese beads. The Czech beads are made in the city of Jablonec, home of the Preciosa beads and the famous Czech glass industry. We can be proud of it, it is of a very high quality and well knows all around the world. It comes is hundreds of shapes, colors and finishes. The Japanese beads are more expensive and it's suitable especially for projects that require a high level of regularity - the Japanese beads tend to be really very very regular in shape. Some of the good Japanese marks are TOHO, Miyuki or Matubo. You will need beads of two sizes for this project, bigger amount of the larger beads and just very few of the smaller ones - I am using the following (Japanese):\n- red - TOHO TR-11-45 (flower and ring)\n- black - TOHO TR-11-49F (flower and rivoli)\n- white - TOHO TR-11-41 (flower and rivoli rivoli)\n- green - TOHO TR-15-44 (rivoli)\nRivoli\nRivoli is the crystal I'm using in the center of the flower. It's a crystal stone shaped pointy towards the center. The most famous rivoli are made by Swarovski, nowadays there are also cheaper copies on the market.\nThread\nSame like the needles, the beadweaving thread is quite different from a sewing thread. It is flat and with a smooth finish to pass easily through the very thin eye of the beading needle. Probably the most famous thread is the nylon thread called NYMO which comes in many colors and sizes from 00 (thinnest) to F (thickest). You have to choose the thickness of your thread according to the bead size and you have to choose your needle according to the thickness of the thread. Another famous and really good thread is the Fireline. For this project I'm using red NYMO in size B for the flower and ring and black NYMO in size B for the rivoli.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVS/K11F/JSYZ8OGO/FVSK11FJSYZ8OGO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRP/C1BK/JSYZ8OIS/FRPC1BKJSYZ8OIS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX2/H137/JSYZ8OKU/FX2H137JSYZ8OKU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4D/GEN0/JSYZ8OMK/F4DGEN0JSYZ8OMK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Material"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Remember, glue and knots have no place in a beadwoven jewelry when it comes to finishing one thread and starting another.

If you really need to make a knot you should find a way to hide it and make sure no one will ever see it - but that would need to be some very exceptional case. Using glue is never justifiable.

Skip one bead in the row and put the needle through the next one. (picture 4)\nPicture 5 is what it looks like. This is the peyote stitch - you keep adding one bead skipping one in the original row and after that you add beads to the spaces between beads. (picture 5)\nContinue until the whole row is dome. As you can see there are two beads next to each other at the end. (picture 6)\nPut the needle back through the last but one bead and then through one more bead. Thread 1 bead and put the needle through the last bead (last black bead in the photo). So now your needle has come through the last bead once again. And once again, go back two beads and now you will be adding 1 bead at a time and filling the spaces. (picture 7)\nFinish the row and your needle will come through the last bead of the previous row. (picture 8)\nThread 4 beads and pass the needle back through the first of them. (picture 9)\nTighten the thread and picture 10 is what it'll look like.

Pass the needle back through the last bead you added and continue with the peyote stitch. (picture 11)\nOnce again, you'll pass the needle through the last bead of the previous row. (picture 12)\nThread 2 beads this time and pass the needle through the last bead you added. (picture 13)\nOn the other side, just go back through the last bead you added and add another row - you can see now that the rows get shorter on one side (this will be the bottom of the petal).

A Light Source(s) - This could be a window letting in natural light, an LED light panel, A diffusion box, a shop light, etc.\n4.

Use the Manual Settings on Your Camera - This allows you to control and repeat how much light is getting into the camera by adjusting the aperture (how big a hole light can get through), shutter speed (how long that hole is open), and ISO (how sensitive your sensor is to light).\n2. Use a Tripod - This is a necessary step because then you can control the angle of your photograph by tilting and turning the camera on the tripod. This angle can be locked in place to keep the camera steady.\n3. Use Stationary Lights & Bounce Cards - Put lights on some kind of stand or table so that they stay in one place. You can use flashes or continuous light, one light or multiple. For still life subjects, such as food photography, it is recommended that you have your key (main light) coming from the side or from behind. To fill in any shadows some kind of bounce card can be used to \"bounce\" light back at an overly dark area.\n4. Use a Tether - Plug your camera into a computer running tethering software with a tethering cord. This allows you to control your camera from your computer and import photos directly into the computer. This will speed up your process because you can see final images on a large screen and make decisions on what else needs to be adjusted in your final image.\nBy controlling as many elements as possible a studio setup allows a photographer to first get technical elements right and then focus solely on your subject, adjusting composition and giving direction.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F74/5ZH3/JSUP0LAS/F745ZH3JSUP0LAS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBW/H83Q/JSUP0LAT/FBWH83QJSUP0LAT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPW/9GIV/JSUP0LAV/FPW9GIVJSUP0LAV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Studio Setup"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Angles:\n90\u00b0.....Camera facing down, called a \"Flat Lay\", \"Birds Eye\" or \"Down Shot\"\n45\u00b0.....Camera diagonal to your subject\n10\u00b0.....Camera slightly above your subject\n0\u00b0.......Camera facing front, looking strait at your subject\n-90\u00b0....Camera facing up, called a \"Worms Eye\" or \"Up Shot\"\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDistances:\nExtreme Close-up.....Super close to the subject, good for showing fine detail and texture, \"Macro\"\nClose-up....................In tight on your subject with very little surrounding it\nMedium Shot.............Slightly backed off of your subject, enough to see the context of what is around the subject\nWide Shot....................Shows the full area around your subject, showcasing a wider scene", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOA/PMOV/JSL36M5U/FOAPMOVJSL36M5U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB5/8NR5/JSL36M2H/FB58NR5JSL36M2H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1I/I8YV/JSL36LZ5/F1II8YVJSL36LZ5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLF/5FR2/JSUP0LJU/FLF5FR2JSUP0LJU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZR/JP5H/JSL36M45/FZRJP5HJSL36M45.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7U/ZJ69/JSL367RX/F7UZJ69JSL367RX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Perspective Overview"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "So with so many options how do we choose where to put the camera?\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt all depends on your subject!

I also was worried that if I made a weighted t-shirt blanket then decided I just wanted it to be a regular blanket that it would take a lot of work to remove all of the weight inside the blanket.\nSo...that led me to the idea of making a weighted duvet, and a t-shirt duvet cover. That way the weights would be in a separate blanket and not wear on the t-shirts, and if I decided I'd rather just have this duvet cover become a regular t-shirt blanket it's a really easy fix.\nNow that the duvet cover is done, next up is for me to make the weighted duvet. I will be making the weighted duvet using a king size sheet folded in half, sewn into columns, then row by row filled with poly pellet weights.

This can mean they stay in the hospital for way longer than normal. Often, hospitals like to gift parents of these babies a colorful quilt make their stay a little brighter.\nThis Instructable is for those people or quilt guilds who are looking for a service project. Make sure you contact your local hospital or organization that accepts and delivers quilts to hospitals BEFORE you make anything. Often, hospitals or organizations will have criteria that you\u2019ll need to follow, as well as desired materials, sizes, needs, and/or prewashing instructions. I recently spoke to a nurse who said they actually need more bereavement quilts for the parents whose babies, sadly, pass away.

Yes, with a yard of fabric, you can make FOUR blankets. What a quick, cheap, and impactful service project!\nThen, either serge or zig zag stitch around the entire rectangle. When using a serger, I use a very thin-width and short length overlock stitch; I don't want there to be any chance to get a teeny toe stuck in a loose thread loop.

Once you get confident, you can use your rotary cutter to make all the cuts; this makes it go a lot faster with smoother lines! Finish cutting all your shirts before proceeding.\nTake a shirt and roughly cut a piece of interfacing that is larger than the print/logo. Place the interfacing bumpy side down on the backside of the logo or desired section of shirt, lay an extra scrap t-shirt on top of it, and iron on the interfacing according to package instructions. You will lay the iron on one section, hold for about 10-20 seconds, and move on. After it\u2019s cool, make sure the interfacing has adhered to the t-shirt.

After that, you will add \u00bc\u201d seam allowances on all sides. Stay with me. Here are examples of what I mean:\nYou have a logo or print that is 3.25\u201d by 10\u201d. You will round up the 3.25\u201d side to 4\u201d and your 10\u201d side to 12\u201d. Then you will add in your \u00bc\u201d on all sides. That makes the final block 4.5\u201dx12.5\u201d.\nYou have a logo or print that is 4.5\u201dx13.5\u201d. You will round up the 4.5\u201d side to 8\u201d and 13.5\u201d side to 16\u201d. After adding in the \u00bc\u201d, the finished block will be 8.5\u201dx16.5\u201d.\nTo make it easier, you are welcome to assume all block sides will be 4.5\u201d,8.5\u201d,12.5\u201d, or 16.5\u201d, but then you might cut off a logo. For example, you might have a logo that is 12.25\u201dx12.25\u201d; you think, that fits into a 12.5\u201dx12.5\u201d square, so I\u2019m good. But when you go to sew your \u00bc\u201d seam, you will lose sides of your logo. This is up to you. Sometimes I don\u2019t mind if a snippet of a logo is cut off because I don\u2019t want to go up to 16.5\u201d, but sometimes the print needs to be wholly intact, so I round up to a bigger size.\n---\nSo what\u2019s the best way to start? Find the exact center of the print/logo. I start by measuring the height of the print. The Mizzou logo is 2\u201d tall. Half of that? 1\u201d. I mark the half point on the left and right side of the logo and draw a line connecting the two, creating the horizontal center line. Then I measure the width of the logo. This one is 10.5\u201d wide, with the half mark at 5.25\u201d. I mark the top and bottom of the logo and draw a vertical line. Now we have the \u201cexact\u201d center.\nI know that my 10.5\u201d width logo needs to be rounded up to 12\u201d with a \u00bc\u201d extra on each side of the center line (that means 6.25\u201d to the right and left, equalling 12.5\" total). Hey, I said this wasn\u2019t beginner, right? :) Take your ruler (or rulers if you don\u2019t have a wide enough one) and measure 6.25\u201d off the right of the center line. DOUBLE CHECK. Then cut. Do the same thing on the left side. I double check to make sure I cut it right. 12.5\u201d width? Yep. Moving on.\nNow I will cut the top and bottom. My 2\u201d tall logo has to be rounded up to 4\u201d (totaling 4.5\u201d). I place my ruler at the 2.25\u201d mark and cut the top of the block. My identical next cut on the bottom will make the completed height 4.5\u201d.\nThe staring logo was 2\u201dx 10.5\u201d and the final block is 4.5\u201dx12.5\u201d.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFH/8UJJ/JSUOWJXJ/FFH8UJJJSUOWJXJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3Q/O2Z8/JSUOW26N/F3QO2Z8JSUOW26N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1E/KBI3/JSUOW26E/F1EKBI3JSUOW26E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4M/ZI5Q/JSUOW2YV/F4MZI5QJSUOW2YV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFE/URU3/JSUOW2CW/FFEURU3JSUOW2CW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAZ/34N6/JSUOW25A/FAZ34N6JSUOW25A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRB/224I/JSUOW1GZ/FRB224IJSUOW1GZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN3/OHO7/JSUOW1A0/FN3OHO7JSUOW1A0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGA/K4CC/JSUOW1P4/FGAK4CCJSUOW1P4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJJ/9Z82/JSUOW1YX/FJJ9Z82JSUOW1YX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSV/P1PB/JSUOW236/FSVP1PBJSUOW236.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWD/2AB1/JSUOW23V/FWD2AB1JSUOW23V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY5/H3EB/JSUOW23W/FY5H3EBJSUOW23W.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: T-Shirt Trimming to Blocks"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "After all that previous work, the best feeling is when you have a logo size that matches a ruler you own!

I had over 70 pieces, so I couldn\u2019t get a spot big enough.\nDo you have a favorite shirt that would be perfect for the center of the quilt? Pick it and let\u2019s start. I chose my first ever sorority shirt because of the symbolism and because it\u2019s so colorful, and I placed it roughly in the center of the floor. Then I picked a shirt that wasn\u2019t so bright (plain and white) and laid it touching but higher than the first shirt; they are touching on the top and bottom 3\u201d of both shirts.\nThe most important thing to remember when laying out shirts is each block side can be divided into 4\u201d sections. (A 4\u201d side is one section, an 8\u201d side has 2 sections, a 12\u201d side has 3 sections, and a 16\u201d side has 4 sections.) To make the shirt layout work, you can\u2019t just lay shirts out willy-nilly. Sides either need to line up perfect (i.e. an 8\u201d side lines up to an 8\u201d side) or the shirts overlap according to \"sections\". My first and second shirt overlap one section (they overlap 4\"). This means an 8\u201d tall block would fit perfectly on top of the first block and line up with the top of the second block.\nYou will get slight overhangs when laying out the quilt because of the \u00bc\u201d seam allowance, but when sewed, the quilt fits perfectly together; you will understand once you start laying out the quilt. It will work, I promise!\nNow, unless magic happened, there will be holes. In one of the last pictures, I have the quilt size I want, but there are gaps where I didn't have enough shirts. This is an easy fix. I know by looking at the quilt holes what size block I will need to fill these gaps. You will too. You will see a hole bigger than 4.5\u201d but smaller than 12.5\u201d and think, I need an 8.5\u201d piece. Often, I will just need a 4.5\u201dx4.5\u201d scrap piece to fill a small gap. Other times, if I am widening a quilt, I will use bigger pieces. It just depends on the look you\u2019re going for. After you know what size you need, pick a scrap piece of shirt, add interfacing, and treat it just like a regular t-shirt block.\nScrap blocks are a perfect way to add more color to an area or just break up a print heavy section, so don't throw those scraps away until the very end!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFZ/BLU6/JSUOX4OG/FFZBLU6JSUOX4OG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ3/0TF0/JSUOX4PN/FQ30TF0JSUOX4PN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAD/983H/JSUOX4RN/FAD983HJSUOX4RN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZK/R2N0/JSUOX4YE/FZKR2N0JSUOX4YE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCJ/YTG9/JSUOX522/FCJYTG9JSUOX522.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8F/7OEQ/JSUOX56Z/F8F7OEQJSUOX56Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPS/8DHM/JSUOX5IU/FPS8DHMJSUOX5IU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY1/1JB8/JSUOX5LD/FY11JB8JSUOX5LD.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Quilt Layout"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Before you move on and sew anything, take a bunch of pictures!

I have squared in yellow the blocks I sewed first.\nBlue: next I sew together more 1:1 sides that I couldn't do in the previous step. For example, I can't sew a 4.5\" to a 12.5\" square, so I'll sew the 4.5\" to an 8.5\", which equals 12.5\", and THEN sew those two blocks to the 12.5\" square. Basically, just keep adding on. The light blue represents the first sections sewed together and the dark blue is just me adding on more blocks that line up perfectly.\nMagenta: this is where it starts to get weird. You'll reach a point where blocks don't line up perfectly anymore and you'll eventually need to sew a block into the \"L\" of another set of blocks. Yes, this is confusing. Don't worry; you'll know exactly what I mean when you get to this point!

The final white border is 1\".\nTo create the scrappy border, I first picked out the greens, whites, light grays, and dark grays that I wanted to see more of. To decide on the width, I needed to make sure my finished top would fit on the batting and backing. (Currently, the quilt is about 80\"x85\" without borders.) Therefore, the top had to be under 104\" (well, under 108\" backing, but I like to leave myself wiggle room). Because of my dimensions, I knew I needed 4.5\" strips.\nI started by cutting a bunch of 4.5\" interfacing strips (so 4.5\"x 20\"). Then I ironed the interfacing to the t-shirts and cut 4.5\" strips.

If it's too wide then my pants become baggy, but if the strip is not wide enough then they are too skinny which brings me back to where I started!\nTo measure, I first roughly fit the pants around my legs and figured out how much wider I needed them to be. I ended up deciding that 3 extra inches would give me a comfortable width, so I need to cut the strip to be 3.5 inches wide so that I can have about 1/4th an inch for seam allowance.\nAfter cutting out two strips 3.5 Inches wide by about 33 Inches long, I sewed them together to make one long strip that was about 65 inches in length! This gave me plenty of room for error, and because I sewed the strip from the middle, (starting at the crotch area and working my way down) I was able to just cut off the extra length down by my ankles in the end.\nPro Tip!: When sewing, be sure that you are stitching the \"wrong sides together\". This means that you need to put the insides of the denim (the side of the fabric that does not show) against each other when you sew.\nDon't forget to watch my video for a visual example : )", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGC/1VIL/JSUOXR4S/FGC1VILJSUOXR4S.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Measure and Sew Your Inner Strip!"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Now that you have one long strip of denim fabric, it is time for the very crucial step of sewing it into the inseam!

We will start with pinning the strip into the inside of the pants, to do this I am going to flip the pants outside out and begin pinning! (wrong sides together)\nWhen pinning the inner strip, I found that it is best to start at the middle most top point of the pants (crotch area). This is so that there will be a little bit of extra fabric hanging down on each side near the ankles, rather than having a LOT of extra fabric hanging down on one side!\nHere's a Pro Tip when pinning: Placing the pins horizontally will ensure that you don't need to take out each pin when sewing. Because the pins are so thin and pointed horizontally (left to right as opposed to up and down) the needle of the sewing machine is able to sew right over them without skipping a beat!\nOnce you're done pinning, just run it through the machine! This should be easy because your pins are in place and everything is lined up. When sewing, I first used a very wide straight stitch. I did this because using a wide stitch makes it easier to take out with a seam ripper if you make a mistake. After I tried it on and found that it fit the way I wanted, then I went over it with a zigzag stitch to lock it in!\nAgain, be sure to watch my video or ask a question if you need something cleared up!", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 5: Sew the Strip to the Inseam!"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Woohoo!

Depending on whether it is a knit or crochet slipper and how stretchy it is, you may need to do this step with your foot in the slipper. As these were very bulky, not too stretchy crochet slippers, I could get away with putting my foot in the slipper on the paper then carefully removing my foot before tracing. In the past though I have added soles to knit slippers with a lot of stretch to them. In this case, you would need to be wearing the slipper to stretch it to the proper size before you trace it (as the suede will not have stretch to it when it is added).\nTrace around the outside of the slipper with a pencil. When you have gone all the way around the slipper you can remove it from the paper and smooth up the outline of the slipper so it is nice and even.\nNow that I have the outline of the soles, I like to add two things to my template that are optional. I like to have the suede wrap up a bit over the toe end of the slipper, so I add a little bit at the top for that. I also make a separation between the top of the slipper and the bottom (with about 3/4 - 1 inch separation). Because the suede will not stretch, this give a little bit of stretching wiggle room to the slipper after the sole is attached. The separation should happen a little closer to the back of the slipper (not right in the middle) , the heel section will be smaller than the front section. I like to round the edges where I've created the separation.\nOnce you have your template sketch finalized go over it with a marker or pen. If you have a lot of extra pencil lines this makes things less confusing when you start to cut it out. If you've created separation between top and bottom you will need to note that on the pieces. If you are making soles for several different slippers at the same time, you should note on the template which set it belongs to. (In this case, I was making a set of 3 slippers in small, medium and large for guest use. Size medium is shown in this instructable)\nCut out your template pieces.

If they are stretch slippers you will need to wear them at this stage (or find a way to stuff them to the right size with newspaper). I start by attaching the bottom piece at the back middle of the heel. Then I attach it at both sides at the separation edge of the bottom. Depending on the slipper you are using you can try to line it up with the rows of the slipper to get a straight even edge. Next, I take the top piece and attach it to the middle of the toe end. My sole is made to slightly wrap around the toe end of the slipper. Then I attach the separation edge of the top, making sure that there is some space between the top and bottom to allow for some stretch. Lastly, I attach it in a few places along the sides of the slippers to keep everything in place while I sew it together. I pin both soles into place before I start sewing so I can make sure that they look the same.\nUsing a yarn needle and yarn, sew the soles to the bottom of the slippers. I used the same yarn that I made the slippers with so that it blends in, but if you are looking for a contrast you could use a different colour of yarn. I sewed the pieces on in the same order that I attached them to the slipper with the pins (starting with the middle of the heel and the middle of the toe.

If at all possible, do this OUTSIDE. I tried but my tealight kept blowing out, so instead I did this right next to an open window. This method creates smoke so make sure you have good ventilation.*\nUse your brush to apply a good layer of glue to the top of the paper leaf. Try to get right to the edges.\nHold the leaf as flat as you can in your metal tweezers. I only had a crocodile clip contraption to do this with, but tweezers would have been easier!\nCarefully move the paper leaf over the flame. Put the paper right onto the flame, making sure the glue-covered side is facing downwards. Constantly keep the leaf moving.\nFocus on a small area at a time, and every few seconds check to see which areas of the glue have been blackened. The idea is to blacken the entire glued surface and get rid of the white colour of the glue.\nIf you hear sizzling, that's good because it means the glue will be bubbling in the flame, but don't keep the same bit sizzling for more than a second otherwise it could catch fire.\nThe main problem I had was with the edges catching light, so only briefly flame the edges. The glue protects the paper, but at the edges the flame can reach the bare paper on top of the leaf, which can then set alight - and the result can be seen in one of the photos above! If this happens, dunk it into your container of water. This is why we make spares :)\nThen repeat the same for every leaf.

There are 192 squares in the sample bedspread. Do the math, that\u2019s a lot of yarn ends to weave in and you do this securely. Make it a practice to weave these in as you crochet each square, unless the pattern says not to (see video). This way, there will be only one yarn end to weave in - the last yarn end, on each square.\nI didn't realize this in the beginning. For the first squares I made, they all have 8 tails to weave in. My strategy was to run the finish end to the beg end of the same color, tie a square knot, run in more following stitch pattern on the back and then clip ends.\nStart with the finish end (yarn end hanging on the edge in this case).\nFold the very end of the yarn end on needle to flatten it so it doesn\u2019t split when you try to thread, Thread your tapestry needle, follow stitch pattern on the back, run in the finish end to the beg end that\u2019s worked over by the dcs. Tie a square knot, thread both ends to tapestry needle, run in more stitches, go in and come out the other side of dcs on corner. Clip yarn ends. Be very careful, don\u2019t cut stitches.\nFinish weaving in the remaining yarn ends the same way.\nAgain the smartest way to do is to weave in yarn end as you crochet by holding the yarn end together with the working end.

This will be your gauge. Mine was 4.5\u201d.\nBedspread size Measure and decide what size you want your bedspread to be. I wanted mine to be 58\u201d by 76\u201d\nSquares total Calculate how many squares you need to make for the size of the bedspread you want. Mine was12.8 squares by 16.8 squares. I decided to round off to 12 squares by 16 squares, 192 squares in total. You can always use edging to make up to the size.\nYarn total Divide your squares total by the rnds that one 100g skein of worsted yarn can make for the rnd (91 rnds for the first color, 57 for the second, 41 for the third, and 29 for the fourth), you get the answer (estimation) for how much yarn you need to buy for each color.\nYarn for 1st rnd, 100g skein of worsted yarn makes 91 rnds, 192/91 = 2.1, round off to 2, I did use exactly 2 of 100g yarn skeins to make 192 rnds of the first color. Calculate yours.\nYarn for 2nd rnd, 100g skein of worsted yarn makes 57 rnds, 192/57 = 3.4, round off to 4, I did use 4 of 100g yarn skeins to make 192 rnds of the second color with some left over. How much will you need?\nYarn for 3rd rnd, 100g skein of worsted yarn makes 41 rnds, 192/41 = 4.7, round off to 5, I did use 5 of 100g yarn skeins to make 192 rnds of the third color with a little bit left over. How much will you need?\nYarn for 4th rnd, 100g skein of worsted yarn makes 29 rnds, 192/29 = 6.6, round off to 7, I did use 7 of 100g yarn skeins to make 192 rnds of the fourth color with a little bit left over. How much will you need?\nYarn for Edging When you complete joining all the squares (192 in this sample), you do edging around the whole bedspread. There were 53 squares around in this pattern. But you only need to work on one of the four sides of the 53 squares. You can do 1, 2, 3 or how many rnds of edging you need to. I did 2 rnds in this pattern. I used same color for edging as the last rnd of the sqaure, 53/4*2 = 26.5, round it off to 27, the amount of yarn needed to do edging is equivalent to make 27 rnds of the last rnd of the square, 27/29 = 0.9, round it off to 1. So I used about 1 skein (100g) of yarn of the 4th color on edging.\nYarn for Fringe How much yarn needed to do fringe depends on the following factors: height of the fringe (12.5\u201d in the sample), multiply by 2 (yarn strand is folded in half to the height), stands of yarn per fringe (2 strands was used in the sample), space between fringes (fringe in every space and between stitches) or in another word, total fringes for the end(s) you will fringe (I did for one long end of the bedspread in the pattern, total fringes for the end is 208), so I used 12.5*2*2*208 = 10400 inches of yarn for fringe. One skein of the yarn used in the project has 210 yards, that\u2019s 7560 inches, 10400/7560 = 1.4, So it was 1.4 skein of yarn for fringe.\nNotes: The measurements and numbers above are project specific, you substitute them with yours.

By trial and error I found out that going slow in the glue up is key. During my test runs I tried to glue al the layers at once which failed over and over again.\nSo finally I took another approach. Every day I would glue up a small piece of the legs (one corner or side every day) with only half the amount of layers. Using a paint brush I applied glue in between the layers for the section I wanted to glue that day and clamped everything together when done. I did this over and over again till done.\nI did the same for the other half of the layers on top of the existing layers . After 12 days of gluing and drying the glue up was complete and ready to process.\nAfter drying I got the veneer of the mold but I notice it is a bid bend. Luckily the 8cm width is more than enough to get two 2,5cm out of it eventho it is a bit bend.\nNOTE: It would have been ideal if the direction of the veneer grain would turn 90\u00b0 with every layer. But the veneer I got in the beginning wat not wide enough to cover the whole stretch. To not mess us by gluing different straps next to each other to cover the whole distance I decided not to do it.\nNOTE 2: Why my first tests were a disaster? In test one I pre-bended the veneer by making it wet in hot water, clamping it on the mold and letting it dry. Next I glued al 14 layers at once and clamped them. As a result it took to long to glue everything and half the glue did not take well. At this point I did not have the negative molds on the outside yet so all the corners had gaps in it.

There are plenty of examples of easy sew pants on Pinterest and the like. These generally rely on the pants being made from two pieces - so the back and the front are the same shape. These pants are a little more complicated than those, but more comfortable in the end!\nMaking a pattern is useful if you want to make more than one set of pants. It also makes it easier to get the design right as the paper will not move and fold like a pair of pants does when you try and arrange it and cut around it. If you are feeling confident you can go right ahead and use your pants as a pattern and skip this step. If you do this, remember to allow for seams so cut a cm or so wider than the actual pants.\nWhen making this pattern I rolled out the paper on a rug and use pins to hold the paper and the pants in place while I drew around them - stops things moving but not necessary!\nFind your most comfortable pair of pajamas or tracksuit pants and turn them inside out.\nFold them so that you have one complete piece of fabric facing up - with seams all around. Generally these pants are made from four panels - the back and front of each leg - so if you fold them in half and lay them down, you can reasonably easily arrange the pants so that the seams are on the outside edge like the first photo above.\nDraw around the edge of the pants, giving yourself an extra cm or two along the edges and a couple of cm at the top and bottom. This is called seam allowance and allows for the fabric that will be used when sewing the pieces together.

I decided to just go ahead and re-draw it by hand using the tools available in the software. It was a quick ten minute job and gave me perfect, clean lines.\nUsing a simple square shape, and converting that square into \"curves\" in order to make the shape work-able, I used the \"shape tool\" to add points by double clicking on a line which adds points and \"anchors\" which you can grab with the shape tool and once placed in certain points, can then be selected by clicking once on a line and grabbing the shape tool + selecting in the \"tools\" area to \"convert line to curve\"\nOnce curves are created then you can grab anchors or (for lack of a better word) \"handles\" and shape the curve in the direction needed. (Hopefully this makes some kind of sense)\nContinue to re-draw the design to your liking and once you've finished the first part of the design, don't forget to add the eye section doing the same and finally adding a circle around the design.\nA perfect circle can be added by selecting the \"ellipse tool\" and holding down the Shift+Ctrl key and the left mouse button and dragging out a circle. The size doesn't matter because we will assign the size according to what the size is in the original design. In this case it was a 9\" circle so we go into the \"object size\" and enter 9.0\". Since the \"non-proportional scaling/ sizing ratio\" (the small padlock icon) is in the \"locked\" position the size will remain proportional so only one dimension is needed, if it were \"unlocked\" the image would only grow or shrink in one direction so you would end up with an actual oval.\nSo our design is complete and clean now.

One is called Wildflower. It\u2019s variegated with soft hues of blue, green, pale yellow, and teal. The other is a solid color called Dark Violet. Both yarns are available from Walmart. I used 18 ounces of each color.\nI chose the colors from yarn I already had on hand. Any pair of colors can be used that go together well.\nThe variegated yarn substitutes nicely for two different yarn colors and makes an attractively subtle pattern that looks pleasantly aquatic. Having two strands of yarn rather than with three makes the Simple Mermaid Throw faster and easier to crochet.\nTo make it even easier I changed the pattern of Rows into modules: two-Row modules for the flipper and four-Row modules for the body. The modular system is very easy to understand and keep track of.\nIn addition, I modified the stitches to make the Rows simpler, so the throw is easier to crochet overall.\nThe stitch originally used in the body looks very nice, but I found the instructions rather difficult to decipher, and the stitch itself hard to maintain. The original Mermaid Tail Throw is not an easy project.\nI made another major change by making the flipper out of two identical fin shapes, stacked and edged together, rather than from just one layer.\nThe original single-layer flipper had was decorative, but had no practical function. It was \u201cfloppy/droopy\u201d and attached to the bottom of the body with a heavy gathered seam. The two-layer flipper is much more substantial and attaches smoothly. It\u2019s also hollow, which not only provides a perfect cozy pocket for Little Mermaid feet but makes the flipper amazingly expressive.\nI was delightfully surprised the first time my Little Mermaid said hello by flapping her flipper at me. It was very lifelike. She has since developed an interesting collection of flips, flaps, and flumps to convey fine nuances of feeling\u2014and keep me laughing.\nThe Simple Mermaid Throw is made from two easy pieces: the body, which has a rectangular upper portion and a tapered lower portion, and the flipper, which is made from two identical fin shapes that stack and are edged together.\nI made the flipper first.\nI used a size H-8 (5.0 mm) hook for the fin shapes and a size I-9 (5.5 mm) hook for the body. I used a small pair of scissors to cut the yarn as needed. I also used four size 2 (1.5\u201d) safety pins to pin the fin shapes together as I edged them, and to pin the flipper to the body as they were being edged together.\nThe smaller stitches from the H-8 hook make the flipper extra warm and comfortable for Little Mermaid feet.\nThis project is a snap for someone who already knows how to do basic crochet. If you can chain, make rows, make the basic stitches, increase, decrease, and back-loop, you\u2019re pretty much good to go.\nFour basic stitches are used in this project, in addition to the usual starting chain:\nSC means Single Crochet\nDC means Double Crochet\nHDC means Half Double Crochet\nTC means Triple Crochet.\nAlways turn the piece over (TO) at the end of each Row to continue.\nYou\u2019ll be alternating colors every two Rows, but you won\u2019t need to cut the yarn each time.

The color of each flipper module alternates, so switch to Wildflower for the second flipper module.\nStarting with the second flipper module, each F1 Row decreases by one stitch at the left end.

What could I make with only things I already had in the house? Items used to fabricate this jacket have been scraps of leather I had saved up over the years, some remnant cloth, and a used YKK zipper. The rivets were probably the only items used that weren't given a second life.\n\nSEWING MACHINES\nThere's a misconception that you need to be rich to afford equipment that will allow you to make beautiful luxury goods. It's not necessarily true, but specialized machines do give you better results. However, you can get away with sewing lightweight leathers on your average home sewing machine. There are some long term cons in doing so, but if it's a one time project or you're just testing the waters, use what you've got. I started off with a $200 Kenmore sewing machine then went to a Singer Heavy Duty ($230). And for the people who still don't believe me, everything on my fashion Instagram page: @jessica.barter has been sewn on the Singer machine. I'm not saying the Singer Heavy Duty was an amazing machine because it wasn't. It broke 4 times in a short span of 5-6 years, but I'm also very aggressive with my tools. Anyways, what I'm trying to say is you can still get away with making a couple of intricate pieces before the timing on your machine seizes. I've upgraded to a JUKI Exceed HZL-F600 ($1049) since. Pricier, but more convenient. You don't need fancy tools, just a vision, and passion.\nIt's important to note, that you'll need an open-toed walking foot attachment to make running the leather through easier on home sewing machines.

It's a meticulous task, but if you take the time to check your work, it'll pay off in the sewing process.\nSTEP 1:\nStart with your basic block. If you don't have one or are new to patterning, take a basic well-fitted shirt that doesn't stretch and use it as a template. You're going to transfer the different pieces that comprise your shirt onto paper. For beginners, it's easier to deconstruct the shirt, so there's no guesswork. For more seasoned sewers, you can use a fabric weight and a tracing wheel to transfer the basic block over.\nSTEP 2:\nDraw your cut lines onto the block. I like keeping a blueprint of the design, so I trace the pattern pieces onto a separate sheet of paper and add on the seam allowance. This method takes longer but keeps you more organized. You always have something to refer back to, in case you lose a pattern piece or forget to label/notch a piece. If you're in a hurry or this is a one-time use project, feel free to just cut the pieces out directly and tape additional paper onto the borders for seam allowance. DON'T FORGET TO LABEL YOUR PATTERN PIECES.\nA general rule is 1/2\" all around and 1/4\" on inclosed seams like necklines and cuffs. Those guidelines can change based on your design or if you're from a different country.\nSTEP 3:\nTrue up your patterns. Truing up your patterns or walking them is the process of aligning pieces that will be sewn together to check if they will sew together correctly. It allows you to see if you have an excess length on one pattern piece or not. If you do, then you're going to have to correct it, either by increasing the length on the opposing pattern piece or by finding the difference between the two. During this part, you also want to notch your pattern pieces. Notching is the act of putting visual registration marks on your pattern piece, so when you go to sewing it, you have indicators to align the seams. When you're done, it should look something like the picture with all the pattern pieces laid out on the floor.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5P/YVPY/JSIUO8O6/F5PYVPYJSIUO8O6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2S/JKES/JSIUO8O7/F2SJKESJSIUO8O7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGM/FW91/JSIUO8PL/FGMFW91JSIUO8PL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: PATTERN MAKING"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "For larger basic pattern shapes, put a fabric weight down on the pattern pieces backside and cut it out with a rotary blade.

If you're using a medium weight, you want to skive some of the thickness off the areas where the seam allowance will be.

Mark the top of the zipper webbing where it bisects the sew line on the top pattern piece. Move the zipper pull below the lines you've just marked before you cut.\nSTEP 2:\nCut your zipper 1/2\" above the mark. Make sure you don't run your blades through the metal teeth. This will damage your shears. Cut carefully between the teeth.\nSTEP 3:\nNow use the nipper pliers to rip the metal teeth off the webbing above the marked line. The nipper pliers are the ones that look like a stumpy hammerhead shark. These pliers work best for removing zipper teeth. Other pliers work but aren't as efficient. For the end caps, cut as close to the edge of the caps as possible. Give it a nice wiggle or two and they should just fall out. Remove the remaining fabric strands that may have collected between the prongs.\nSTEP 4:\nThis part can be dangerous, so proceed with caution. You're going to have to open the clamped zipper ends.

More on fabric in the next steps.\nThe most important tool you\u2019ll need for a successful rag quilt is a very sharp scissor.

Of course this project will go much faster with a sewing machine, though you can hand sew with needle & thread if you choose.

I like to choose contrasting colors and a variety of patterns and solids. How much you need depends on the size of your quilt. I like to err on the side of caution, so I tend to buy more fabric then I will need.\nHere is my general rule of thumb: After you\u2019ve decided on a quilt size, figure out how many square inches it will be. (Just multiply length x width) Now add another 50%. This will be approximately how much total fabric you need for one side. Remember, you\u2019ll be piecing together squares from multiple fabric cuts, so you need extra in case the number of squares don\u2019t work out perfectly with the fabric with you have chosen. Then you will need to do the same thing for your fabric on the back of your quilt.\nIf you want a solid border around your quilt, purchase enough extra fabric to go around the length and the width without chopping those pieces into squares. You can always decide on the border at the end, and purchase your border fabric when you have your quilt done.\nSo, for a small 3\u2018 x 3\u2018 quilt, I make sure to have at least a yard and a half for the front and a yard and a half for the back of the quilt. I usually over-buy so that I have flexibility in my sizing and design. Flannel is cheap so the extra cost is negligible.\nNote: Cheating is OK\nYou can buy precut squares of flannel if you want to skip the steps of choosing your own combinations and cutting out squares. I\u2019ve never done this because I enjoy designing the pattern, but there\u2019s no reason not to. Just make sure that you are getting flannel, and that you have enough for your entire quilt. This is a much more expensive option than buying yardage and cutting the fabric yourself.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8I/F8MC/JSL382AR/F8IF8MCJSL382AR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Getting Started - Flannel"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Once I have the idea for my quilt, I like to go to the fabric store and begin by choosing one or two patterns that I love.

It\u2019s also OK to make the front and the back the same, if you want. Personally, I like to contrast the front and the back, but this is part of your creative choice.\nWhen first learning to make rag quilts, purchase equal amounts of each color or pattern for the front, adding up to at least the total you previously calculated. Do the same for the back fabrics.\n\nNot sure?

At least for your first couple of quilts, all the squares should be the same size.\nIf you don\u2019t have a quilt pattern in mind, the best thing to do is start by cutting an equal number of squares from each flannel pattern. You can cut squares with a scissor or a rotary cutter either on a ruled mat or by marking the fabric with something washable.

The top/front will form a lump and the back will give you a zig zag pattern as shown in the last few images.\nNow, I ended up doing this so the lump was on top, but now that I've done it, I would have rather done this upside down so it was less noticeable.\n(I'm going to do this join in black so it blends in better, but I did it in blue here so you can see what I'm doing.)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0Z/AJB8/JSKOS8Y6/F0ZAJB8JSKOS8Y6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLG/EQQF/JSKOS8Y7/FLGEQQFJSKOS8Y7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1P/2MGW/JSKOS8Y8/F1P2MGWJSKOS8Y8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJL/HYFE/JSKOS8Y9/FJLHYFEJSKOS8Y9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA6/R0EI/JSKOS8YA/FA6R0EIJSKOS8YA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5B/GA9F/JSKOS8YZ/F5BGA9FJSKOS8YZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH6/J4SE/JSKOS8Z0/FH6J4SEJSKOS8Z0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC7/K2TC/JSKOS8Z1/FC7K2TCJSKOS8Z1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQE/PEB6/JSKOS8Z2/FQEPEB6JSKOS8Z2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKV/3YAA/JSKOS8Z3/FKV3YAAJSKOS8Z3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Y/V07B/JSKOS8Z4/F8YV07BJSKOS8Z4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF9/1LZK/JSKOS8Z5/FF91LZKJSKOS8Z5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8I/117X/JSKOS8Z7/F8I117XJSKOS8Z7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4E/STND/JSKOS8Z9/F4ESTNDJSKOS8Z9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F25/UOK2/JSKOS8ZA/F25UOK2JSKOS8ZA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Single Crochet Granny Square Join"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Since I didn't need any extra length (besides the little bit mentioned in the last step) I decided to do a simple whip stitch join method that just involves sewing through the back loops so the front loops stay on top.\nYou can check out a variety of joins to choose from here.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2G/RTTY/JSKOS8ZB/F2GRTTYJSKOS8ZB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9E/3RDB/JSKOS8ZC/F9E3RDBJSKOS8ZC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8D/9965/JSKOS8ZD/F8D9965JSKOS8ZD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0C/UQQM/JSKOS8ZE/F0CUQQMJSKOS8ZE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Connect All Your Squares"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Now that I had all the squares whip stitched together, I did my single crochet join to connect the last two squares (and connected the headband) together.\nNow you should have an unfinished but still nice headband.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHT/DKUW/JSKOS8ZF/FHTDKUWJSKOS8ZF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEW/VY1C/JSKOS8ZG/FEWVY1CJSKOS8ZG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSH/9P5L/JSKOS8ZH/FSH9P5LJSKOS8ZH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWG/RCKT/JSKOS8ZI/FWGRCKTJSKOS8ZI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Finish Joining the Headband"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "To give your headband a nice finished feel, it's time to give it a border.\nI did a single border in blue, but you can do as many as you want, just make sure your headband doesn't get too wide.\nBecause my squares weren't as square as I wanted (possibly fixed as I mentioned by doing single crochets instead of half double crochets around the puffy flower), I did a border of single crochet stitches with half double crochet stitches where the squares met to try to get a straighter line.

I'm The Redsmith, I'm a maker.\nA few days ago, my wife, my son and I were lucky enough to get tickets for the premiere of the movie How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World.

I highly recommend you to go and watch it.\nAs I was watching the movie, I started to wonder if I would be able to make Hiccup's helmet for my kid, and as soon as I got back home, I started working on this helmet. It took me a long time to figure out a design that would work from my memories and the few pictures I found online, but I think I got it pretty close to what you'll see in the movie.\nI used 2.4mm/6oz vegetable tanned leather for all the parts of the helmet, except the little spikes on the side, for which I used 2.2mm/5oz veg. tan. leather. There are many ways to make a helmet out of leather. Personally, I chose to wet the leather and to shape it on a mannequin head which is almost the size of my kid's head. The most difficult part was to carve the leather in order to make it look like dragons scales, but I think I managed to make fake dragon scales pretty well :)\n\nThe helmet is too small for me a slightly too big for my kid, which is a good thing, he'll be able to play with it for a long time as he grows up. It was a lot of work, but my kid loves it, so it was totally worth the time I spent on it.\nThis helmet is a unique piece, only made for my son.

People are crazy about these, and at $125-$300 a blanket, you started wondering, is it all hype? Why would people pay that much for a blanket?\nThe underlying science of weighted blankets are that by applying pressure to the body they will increase the release of serotonin. Serotonin is a chemical in the body that promotes relaxation.\nThere are other names for weighted blankets, such as gravity blanket or therapy blanket. They are not a new thing, they have been used for ages. But they are super popular right now.\nDisclaimer: I am not a medical professional, I don\u2019t play one on TV and never intend to either. The information I am sharing is from personal experiences, internet research and discussion with people that have these blankets. I don't know everything, but I do enjoy making these blankets and so far those that have received them, seem to enjoy them.\nYou can learn a little more about the suggested benefits by a quick google search. Here is a site you can start with:\nhttps://www.sensacalm.com/blogs/news/benefits-of-weighted-blanket-therapy\nAnyway, all that mumbo jumbo aside, you might be reading this because you want to make or buy a weighted blanket. Hopefully I can provide more info on what goes into making the blanket and what works for me.\nWord for the wise, you can make a blanket in a weekend, but this is not a one hour project and materials are not cheap. In some cases you might have to purchase some materials online. If your planning to whip one out in an evening for $20 or $30 bucks, forget it. The fabric will cost you $25+ on the cheap side, weighted pellets or beads are $2-$4 a pound. Raw cost for me to make a throw size, weighted blanket with all material included is at least $75 and it takes me about 2 days. But that is part of why they sell for so much.

Too many colors, too wild of a pattern or too many textures all play with a person\u2019s senses. The purpose of the blanket is to relax and provide comfort. Someone with a severe sensory acuteness can find these things stressful, not relaxing. This is why a true therapy blanket is plain, made of cotton and solid colors.\nAre you making this for someone with anxiety issues or PTSD? Go a little on the heavy side. I have no science to support this, but my experience with those I have made blankets for that suffer from these \"restless\" types of disorders actually seem happier with blankets that weigh them down more. Something about being more grounded.\nThere is no one fabric, weight, size or color for everyone, but think about who you are making this for and you can get a good idea of what details to place at your highest priority.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBU/U6E1/JSITP5MW/FBUU6E1JSITP5MW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: A Few Things Before You Start Sewing: User"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "When considering the fabric you want to use, think about the person you are making the blanket for.

But also think about some of these factors:\nAre they short, like me? In that case a long throw size is extra weight that hangs off the couch and pulls on my feet, thus I don't like it.\nAre they using this at night? A minkie or sherpa fabric will slide around and fall off the bed in their sleep. It is also warm and might be sweaty in their sleep.\nWill it be used as a throw blanket for the couch? They will want something to snuggle into, so maybe not a cotton or wool blanket.\nA few more things in mind:\nThe fabric will define the weighted pellets and/or if you have to line the blanket.\nSome people get pre-made blankets and open the seam on one side. I have done this, it worked great and cut down on cost. I have also gone to the local fabric store and purchased fabric, either way is fine.\nYou can use any type of fabric, some popular fabrics are minkie, sherpa, wool, polar fleece and cotton.\nRemember that you have to put the weight in the blanket so check the weave, you don\u2019t want the weighted pellets to drop through the fabric.\nIf the fabric you choose doesn't have a tight weave you need to plan to have a liner, like a extra length of muslin or cotton on the inside to hold the pellets in.\nOnce the weight is in the blanket, you don\u2019t want the fabric to droop, so buy quality fabric.\nSee more about fabric, under the fifth point, about the weight in a weighted blanket.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZA/BJ2S/JSITP0HA/FZABJ2SJSITP0HA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: A Few Things Before You Start Sewing: Fabric"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "How do you know how heavy a weight blanket should be? Well the blankets should give the person using it the feeling of being relaxed. Too light, and it is just a blanket, too heavy and it is overbearing.\nThink of it this way, when the blanket is too heavy it is like going on a long walk, you feel fatigued and exhausted, essentially weighted down. At the right weight it will feel like a welcome hug, grounded and relaxed.\nHow do you find that weight? The magic number is 10% of a person's body weight, give or take 3 lbs. A child\u2019s blanket should never be more than 10 lbs, and are most often in the 5 lbs range. Weighted blankets are not recommended at all for pregnant woman.\nThe plus or minus 3 lbs is personal preference. As I mentioned earlier, my experience with those that have anxiety issues is that they seem to prefer a blanket that is a little on the heavy side, weighing them down more.\nI have no medical concerns and actually prefer a blanket that is on the light side. My husband who also has no medical concerns likes a blanket about exact to his weight.\nSo how do you know what to make? Well you can make multiple blankets and play with the weight, go to a craft fair and try out blankets someone else has made, or just make one to the 10%.

These are the same things used by our grandmothers for years to make all those cute little dolls with the heavy rear ends. How do you know what to use? Everyone you ask will have a list of do\u2019s and don\u2019t. There are lots of opinions and interpretations. Here is my breakdown:\nPoly Pellets: Poly is actually the brand name. This brand has been around since . . .well forever. These are plastic pellets, made of 100% polypropylene, hint the Poly part of the name. You can find many other brands of plastic pellets, but essentially, they are small round plastic pellets that create a uniform fill. They do have a texture like tiny pebbles. Many people have said to stay away from recycled pellets, something about their smell. I have never used recycled pellets so I can not speak to this.\nThese are NOT made of PET or PETE (polyethylene terephthalate), the dreaded bottle plastic. These are said to be safe.\nGlass Beads: Also like the name implies, these are truly glass beads, like what is used in a sand blasting cabinet. The weights and sizes of these beads vary from small pebbles to a thin sand. Choose wisely, they have to stay inside your blanket without sliding through the weave of the fabric. While these are glass, I have never heard any stories of the glass breaking or splintering, again said to be totally safe.\nA great resource for more info is https://thesleepstudies.com/glass-beads-plastic-pellets-for-weighted-blanket\nFYI I am not in any way affiliated with this website. I don't know who wrote it, but I found the info very helpful.\nWhether you choose Poly pellets or glass beads, it will make a difference in the fabric you use for your blanket and the overall feel of the blanket. Because Poly pellets are larger and plastic is lighter, you will need to use more pellets by quantity to get the same weight, but you can use a looser woven fabric. This will mean that the weight is visible when the blanket lays flat. The blue a grey blanket I am making for this, will be made with a version of Poly Pellets.\nUsing glass beads means a thinner profile for the blanket, so you may not actually see the weight in the blanket. But it also means that likely you will have to include a liner to keep the pellets from sliding through the weaves in the fabric, adding to cost. The all grey minkie blanket in some of my pictures was made with glass beads and includes a cotton liner.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTL/47KA/JSITOI53/FTL47KAJSITOI53.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: A Few Things Before You Start Sewing: Weight"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "When you pick your fabric, know your pellets, for my first project I used minkie and my glass pellets slid right through. I had to use a liner to keep the pellets in and that adds extra time and costs.\nIn a pinch, old sheets make a great liner, after all no one is going to see the material on the inside anyway.\nIf you use minkie fabric, just plan to use a liner.\nWeight is total weight, not just the pellet weight. Weigh the fabric before adding pellets. Otherwise your 18 lbs blanket will end up being 23 lbs after your done.\nAll pellets differ a little, so don\u2019t assume that 1 tablespoon will always weigh the same. Different manufacturers or materials will make an even bigger difference. You have to actually weigh each pocket as you go. You have to have a scale to distribute the weight evenly.\nGet a fabric with lines in the pattern, like a plaid. You might be great at sewing straight lines, but once your halfway through the blanket and there is some weight to one side, it will want to slide off the table. You will get tired of fighting it, and your lines will start getting crazy. The bottom and top fabric don\u2019t have to have lines, but if one does you will save yourself a lot of frustration.\nPlan a few extra inches of fabric on the top of the blanket, this will give you plenty of space for feeding the pellets and to sew the last line without having to vacuum up thousands of pellets later. Trust me, at least an extra 2 inches.\nWhen you are pouring the weight into the blanket, rest the blanket on a chair. Set the blanket in the chair, pour over the back of the chair, so the weight settles in the seat of the chair. If you have a swivel chair, or one on wheels this helps move the blanket around and saves some arm strength and back twisting. The 10 or 15 lbs of blanket will start feeling a million times heavier after moving it around for 2+ hours.\nTape the funnel to the wrapping paper roll. My hubby is a genius!\nIf you use polar fleece, cut off the rolled raw edge, it just leaves a lump in the blanket.\nPro Tip: If you cut it nice, you can use it as a \u201cribbon\u201d to wrap around the blanket.

But really, start out by doing the same steps you would do to make any simple two fabric blanket.\nTake right sides of the fabric and line them up together. You want right sides together, (that means that the sides you want to see when the blanket is complete are touching).\nThan sew a tight straight stitch along 3 of the 4 edges. You want to leave one side open for adding the pellets.\nWhen you sew, leave or 1/4\" to 1/2\" seam. If your blanket requires a liner, sew all 3 or 4 layers of fabric together at once. Put the liner fabrics on the outside, so when you turn the blanket right sides out, the liner will be in the inside.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what side of the blanket is left open - unless there are only lines (stripes) in the fabric running one direction, make sure you leave open the side with the lines running vertical, so you can sew on the line after weight is added. If it is plaid, than Bob\u2019s your Uncle.\nNow, turn the blanket right sides out, and lay the seam flat. You should now have three sides sewn together and one side open, like a pillow case.\nNow sew a small tight zigzag line around the 3 sewn edges. You are doing this for aesthetics. When you complete the 4th edge, you will not be able to turn the blanket inside out, thus you will fold in the fabric and close it with the same small tight zigzag line giving the blanket consistency all the way around.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPP/1S2R/JSITOLN9/FPP1S2RJSITOLN9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXV/KCBB/JSITOLWV/FXVKCBBJSITOLWV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO8/7H0L/JSITORU9/FO87H0LJSITORU9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ7/D632/JSITOCKG/FQ7D632JSITOCKG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Now Let's Get Started"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "To evenly distribute the weight, a grid of pockets is created that hold the weighted pellets in place. This way you don\u2019t get 10 lbs all in one corner of the blanket. These don\u2019t have to be squares, have fun, make them whatever fits your fabric, rectangle, triangle, duck shapes. Again there are a lot of opinions about how big or small each pocket should be. I feel this is defined by the material, what weighted pellets you use and just plan personal preference. Here is how I define my grid.\n1. Weigh the blanket, using the scale (like the one from your bathroom) that measures pounds to see how heavy the blanket is at this time. Write that number down. In the picture you can see my fabric weighs 3 lbs.\n2. Now lay the blanket out on the floor or table so you can see the whole blanket. Look at the fabric. If you have plaid or stripes measure the distance between the lines, I find that 4 to 6 inch squares are ideal. See how your blanket lays out using the patterns you have in the fabric. Don\u2019t set up the pockets to sew through the animals on the fabric when maybe you can sew a grid around them.\nI said that the pellets and personal preference also weigh in:\nIf your using Poly pellets, they are larger in size for the same weight. Thus your pockets will need to be large enough to fit the desired weight in each pocket of the grid. Glass beads can be very small but are heavier, so you get more weight with less mass. In the end you want the pellets to have enough space to lay flat in the pocket later, after you wash the blanket, you want to lay it flat to dry, so some space is a good thing.\nPersonal preference is all about you, do you want to sew and fill four hundred pockets with a \u215b oz of pellets or only one hundred pockets with \u00bd oz of pellets each? Obviously one hundred pockets is faster, but is it better? In my experience, big pockets are not better. When the weighted pellets have lots of room to move around, they do. And that takes away from the even distribution of weight. Thus I go for a 4\u201dx 4\u201d to a 5\u201d x 5\u201d square. Somewhere in this realm usually means around 200 pockets. Thus I keep my sanity and the weight distributes nicely.\n3. Don\u2019t sew anything yet, just get out a piece of paper and draw your plan. You will need vertical and horizontal lines to create the pockets/grid for the weight. Count how many horizontal pockets and how many vertical pockets you have and write that down. Take those two numbers and multiply them to know how many pockets you will make total. For instance if you have 14 horizontal pockets and 16 vertical pockets, you will have created 224 pockets.\n4. Now that you know the weight of the fabric in pounds, the number of pockets, and how heavy you want the blanket to be you can define how much weight goes in each pocket of the grid. See above in \"Step 3: A Few Things Before You Start Sewing: How Heavy\" if you need to figure how heavy you want the blanket.\nStart by taking how heavy you want the blanket to be and subtracting the current weight of the fabric to get the weight that needs added.\nLet\u2019s say the current fabric weight is 3 pounds. I want a 10 pound blanket. Thus I need to add 7 pounds.\n10 lbs - 3 lbs = 7 lbs\nSince there are 16 ounces in a pound, you can multiply the pounds needed by 16 to get total ounces to add.\nI need to add 7 pounds, times 16 equals 112 ounces.\n7 lbs X 16 = 112 oz\nDivide the number of ounces needed by the number of pockets to get how many ounces per pocket.\nI need to divide 112 ounces to 224 pockets, I need to add 0.5 ounces per pocket.\n224 / 112 oz = 0.5 oz\n5. Now go to your Shipping scale (or food scale) that measures ounces and actually measure out the ounces that go into one pocket. I am a visual person and this helps me see how much or how little I am adding. All pellets differ a little, so don\u2019t assume that 1 tablespoon will always weight the same. Different manufacturers or materials will make an even bigger difference. You have to actually weigh each pocket as you go, but for now this gives you a visual of what it will look like.\nNow we go back to personal preference, are you adding a 1/16th ounce of weight to 500 pockets? Do you really want to do that, would 1/8th ounce to 250 pockets make a difference? Look at the volume of pellets and the size of the pocket. Find the medium that feels good to you and flows with your fabric. Making 2\u201d X 2\u201d squares looks amazing, but will take way longer than 2 days to make. A 6\u201d X 6\u201d square might seem huge and sloppy or maybe it is the perfect fit for your fabric and pellets.\n6. Once you have played with the numbers and your fabric to find the grid that works for you, take the Embroidery Tape (blue tape of you don\u2019t have embroidery tape) and mark your lines. Just a small piece of tape at the line you will start on is enough if your fabric has stripes.\nIf your fabric does not have lines to follow for sewing, you will need to use a fabric pen to draw lines for sewing, draw the lines all the way across the fabric. See the attached image, draw both the red and the blue lines, creating your complete grid.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJD/1SHG/JSITOCOI/FJD1SHGJSITOCOI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMD/KV6R/JSITOCWY/FMDKV6RJSITOCWY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUH/H6WS/JSITOW94/FUHH6WSJSITOW94.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSU/DPWR/JSITOGNU/FSUDPWRJSITOGNU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBF/997V/JSITOGNP/FBF997VJSITOGNP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAG/9NM0/JSITOCYC/FAG9NM0JSITOCYC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F40/PT62/JSITOD0Y/F40PT62JSITOD0Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKY/LPRK/JSITOD2H/FKYLPRKJSITOD2H.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: The Grid and the Weight"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "Now that you have had a mental drain from figuring out the size of the blanket, how the grid will lay, how big the pockets will be, the weight and size of the blanket and all that other jazz; you are ready to lean back and just sew.\nStart by sewing a tight straight stitch for all the horizontal lines on the blanket, these are the blue lines on the attached picture. The horizontal lines run the length of the blanket and end at the open side. These stitches need to be tight enough that pellets cannot travel between the stitches and end up in a different pocket.\nLeave a few inches between your final stitch and the end of the fabric.

You are going to fill each of these pockets with the desired weight of pellets per one pocket. In this example, you are adding 0.5 oz to each line/pocket.\nTo make this easier, take an old wrapping paper tube, tape a funnel on the top. Shove it down the first pocket and than pour the pellets in the funnel. This will assist guiding the weighted pellets to the bottom of the blanket. This way you don\u2019t have to shake the pellets down, and they end exactly where you want them.\nNow remove the tube from the first pocket, go to the next pocket and repeat until all the pockets from one row are filled.\nAfter one row has been filled, sew the same type of tight straight stitch across the vertical line as you did the horizontal lines, closing the pocket. This is the lowest red lines in the attached drawing. FYI your sewing machine will be unhappy if the needle hits a pellet, so guide the pellets out of the way with your fingers if you have too.\nNow start the next row of pockets, one row at a time.

In this case my solid grey fabric is longer than my print fabric so I trim the solid grey fabric so it is close to the same length as the print fabric.\nNow, while sitting at your sewing machine, pour the pellets in the pocket, one pocket at a time. Sew that pocket closed and than pour the weight in the next pocket. Depending on how big the pockets are, you may have to fill two pockets at a time, due to the neck width of the sewing machine (room between the needle and the edge of the machine as the fabric runs).\nThe other trick with these pockets, are that you are closing the blanket at the same time you are adding the weights. This is why you left an extra few inches of fabric. Pour the pellets in the pocket, fold the fabric right sides together, creating the binding and than sew a small tight zigzag line looking similar to what was sewn on the other 3 sides.\nAdd pellets to the next pocket and continue to the end of the blanket.\nDONE!!

When they are under the table out of sight, you may have to hunt among the clutter to find them again and the two similar pedals may be mixed up.\nTo make it a better and more comfortable experience with using the foot pedals, I made a base to hold the two foot pedals in place.", "title": "Sewing Machine and Serger Foot Pedal Base", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Sewing-Machine-and-Serger-Foot-Pedal-Base/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The foot pedal base is really just a fancy compartmentalized tray to hold everything in place.\nUse any thin plywood or in this case, I had a piece of hardboard laying around that was perfect for what we needed. I did not need to have the pedals raised higher off the floor but you can build with thicker materials if desired.\nInstead of using power tools and kicking up a lot of debris and dust when cutting particle board kind of stuff, you can deeply score the hardboard with a utility knife and snap it on the line to break and separate, just like drywall. Cut the line deep or else the material might rip a ragged edge or tear out a random piece from either side.\nI used some 1/2 inch x 2 inch craft wood strip stock to form the sides.\nLay out your foot pedals and use a small scrap piece of stock pushed up against the sides of your foot pedal and as a spacer between the foot pedals to mark out exactly where you need to cut. No need to use exact ruler measurements. Cutting a hair bigger or outside the marked line will give enough play for the foot pedal to fit in...or else trim/sand later to make it fit.\nPieces are cut to frame out the pedal and make the holding compartment for each.\nGlue the first piece on. When dry, test fit the next piece and mark the position so you can apply glue and glue it on.\nClamp for even contact between the hardboard and wood pieces.

I did gouge out most of the wire cable slot by drilling several holes and moving the bit to act as a router of sorts to mill away the wood. Wire flush cutters work surprisingly well for wood.\nA wood rasp, surform tool, edge radius rounding slickplane, file, and sandpaper will handle the rest of the shaping and finishing. Use the sanding dust to mix with glue for filler if you find any large voids that may appear, especially at the glue joints. I did not cut everything exactly square with the hand saw and did not glue precisely.\nSince the foot pedals are under the table out of sight, I can probably memorize which pedal is which but I added a texture under the sewing machine foot pedal for more positive tactile feedback that I am stepping on the correct pedal. I've got a box of both narrow and wide popsicle sticks so I glued some pieces to form the speedbump stripes.\nI used the wide popsicle sticks to make the cable cover and hold-down.

Sand lightly between coats.\nTo prevent the big rig from slipping on a smooth floor add on some rubber feet or non-slip stair tread/bathtub safety tape to the bottom.\nI just printed the logo of the brand of machines I have for a sticker and glued that to the foot pedal base to make it look like an official accessory...which they should make...

You know.\nThey would always look for warm spots to take a nap, because ferret fur isn\u2019t very thick, and they would get cold easily. So I\u2019d make little tents, covered hammocks, tunnels, and things like that.\nI had so much fun designing this ferret house. I love the spikes, and the springy tail that looks like a medieval mace and has a squeaker inside. The monster body is held open with poly featherboning, to make it easy for the little fuzzbutts to crawl inside and snooze. The details like the teeth and spikes on the tail/spine were both for looks, and so that the ferrets would have more things to tug on.\nI will give the pattern away here as a free download to anyone who might want to make their own ferret monster, or if you would rather buy the monster that I made for this Instructable, you can do so on my blog. You can also use the methods in this tutorial to design a creature from your own imagination.\nThe completed sleeper is quite large (44\" long, including the tail), and I'd imagine that a small dog or cat could also use this to play in.

Most fleece in the fabric store is that wide, but check and make sure before you buy it.\nYou will need a small amount of fleece in a contrasting color for the teeth, claws, eyeballs, and spikes on the spine/tail. 1/4 yard of 57\u2033 wide fleece is plenty.\nYou also need basic sewing supplies (thread, scissors, etc), and if you are using a sewing machine, you will need to use a size 14 ball point needle. (Depending on where you live, it might be called a size 90 stretch needle.)\nI used a piece of 1\u2033 wide elastic that is 15\u2033 long, to make the tail springy. My ferrets loved boingy things. But if you want, you can omit the elastic and you\u2019ll have a longer, flatter tail.\nI used 2 yards of poly featherboning to hold the mouth open, so my little monsters could easily find their way inside the big monster. This is optional, but I think it makes the sleeping bag more practical. I chose poly because then you can throw the monster into the washing machine (machine washability is a must when I make a project for pets). (The link to the featherboning is an affiliate link, meaning that if you use it to make a purchase, I will earn a small commission at no extra cost to you.)\nI'm putting a squeaker in the tail, but you could use a rattle, or leave the noisemaker out entirely.\nThe monster eyeballs are open to interpretation, but make sure they aren\u2019t made out of anything that the ferrets could choke on (buttons seem like a potential choking hazard to me). I have included a pattern piece to make eyeballs out of your accent fabric.\nYou will also need access to a printer to print out the pattern, and tape to tape the pieces together.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FM6/AFI7/JSCG4BNO/FM6AFI7JSCG4BNO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Materials"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Print page 1 of the pattern at 100%, and page 2 at 400%. Page 2 should be tiled onto 16 sheets of paper. You will need to cut out the pieces from page 2, and tape them together into larger pattern pieces. Using the original file as your guide, cut on the lines, match everything up, and tape the pattern pieces together.\nFold the large piece of fleece in half, right sides together, with the two selvages (the edges that were not cut at the fabric store) meeting each other. You should have a piece that is about 30\u2033 by 36\u2033. Lay out the pattern pieces on the fabric as shown: One piece will be placed along the folded edge, and the others will be spaced out across the rest of the fabric.\nYou will need to cut out the legs 4 times, which will give you 8 pieces (because the fabric was folded to begin with.) Just cut out one leg at a time, and then move your pattern piece over to cut the other 3 legs, spacing them out like I\u2019ve shown in the picture. You should have plenty of fabric if you don\u2019t make your cuts too far apart. It\u2019s a good idea to pin the pairs of leg pieces together as you get them cut out, because you will sew them in pairs, and pinning them now will save some rearranging time later. Pin the tail pieces together, too.\nPage 1 of the pattern is printed at the correct size already, so just cut out all of the paper pieces on the line. The oval shapes are to make the ball at the end of the tail. You will need to cut 6 of the ovals out of the large fleece piece (so cut out the oval 3 times on the folded fabric, which will give you 6 ovals).\nThe other pieces from page 1 (a circle and two triangles) will be cut out of the other fabric. Fold your 1/4 yard of accent fabric in half, right sides together. The circles are for the monster\u2019s eyeballs, so you need to cut the pattern piece once out of your accent fabric (which gives you two eyeballs, because the fabric is folded).\nGo on to the next step to use the triangle-shaped pattern pieces.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FY3/8NFT/JSAOUKJ7/FY38NFTJSAOUKJ7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKX/SPK2/JSAOUKJI/FKXSPK2JSAOUKJI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Print the Pattern and Cut"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The triangles are for the teeth, claws, and spikes.

Leave some space in between the long edges of the triangles (about 1/2\u2033, or 1 cm will work fine) so that you can cut them apart after they\u2019re sewn. But you can trace the short ends right next to each other, or against the edge of your fabric, because the short side will not need a seam allowance.\nSew a V shape on the line, so that you\u2019ve sewn the long sides of the triangle, and left the bottom unsewn. Now cut all of the triangles out. Cut right on the unsewn line (the shortest line, the bottom of the triangle), but leave a small seam allowance on the two sewn sides. Flip all of the triangles right-side out so that your seams are on the inside.

Take a pair of leg shapes that you cut out and pinned together earlier. The leg pieces should be right-sides together already. Now take 3 of the small triangle shapes, and place them between the pieces of leg fabric, one at the end of each toe. The unsewn, short end of the triangle should be lined up with the cut edge of the leg fabric, and the tip of the triangle should be pointing in towards the foot. (Remember that the triangles should all be right-side out at this point!)\nIf you\u2019re new to sewing, or if you\u2019ve never used fleece before, then put plenty of pins in. I have oriented the pattern pieces on the layout so that you shouldn\u2019t have too much trouble, but fleece does stretch some, and it\u2019s easy for the stretch to get away from you when you\u2019re working with long pieces like you\u2019re using in this project. So more pins is better, unless you\u2019re a seasoned seamer and feel like you\u2019ve got this.\nSew, starting at the shoulder end, all down one side, around each toe, and back up the other side towards the shoulder.

I am using - and will always recommend using - a piece of glass for your surface. Before that, however, I used a piece of plywood with a plastic sheet on top and that worked too. This is a 100cm square tempered piece of glass that I got from work. (I am a Glazier)\nlastly, you will need about 4-5 hours of time to complete this project; most of that is just waiting for the paper to dry ;)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FML/Z7MG/JSAORROR/FMLZ7MGJSAORROR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: The Items You Will Need for This Project"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "First thing is first, we have to talk about the key ingredient in how this Origami paper is made. The number one item you wouldn't be able to do this project without is Methyl Cellulose. This is an excerpt from Wikipedia that explains what this stuff is perfectly, \"... a chemical compound derived from cellulose. It is a hydrophilic\nwhite powder in pure form and dissolves in cold (but not in hot) water, forming a clear viscous solution or gel. It is sold under a variety of trade names and is used as a thickener and emulsifier in various food and cosmetic products, and also as a treatment of constipation. Like cellulose, it is not digestible, not toxic, and not an allergen.\"\nSo when you end up getting this stuff it should be a white powder, as explained. The word to look out for here is \"thickener\". This is not necessarily a glue, but it works just like one. However, it is really just thickening the tissue paper so it doesn't rip or tear easily when you fold it. Just for your own curiosity I just found out that whole milk can also be used as an adhesive and I actually want to try it for this application sometime.\nI will post a video link to the best way I have seen this demonstrated when it comes to how to mix it, but also my images should help.\nIn order to make this you take 11 grams of MC powder and 1450 ml of water and mix them. That's It! 1450 milliliters of water is basically a little more than half of a 2 liter bottle. You can see on my bottle where I put a black line so I never have to measure that random amount ever again. It won't make a huge difference if you don't get the perfect amount of water and it really depends on if you want a thicker or thinner MC glue for different thicknesses of tissue paper. This is the best recipe I have found so far. Be sure to make the MC glue the night before because it takes about all night long to set up. But then it lasts for months!\nHere is the link to the video; it is way too long so just be patient:\nAlso here is the link to Amazon.com for where to buy this stuff super cheap!\n<https://www.amazon.com/Lineco-Methyl-Cellulose-Adhesive-bottle/dp/B000KNLG1Y/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=methylcellulose&link_code=qs&qid=1550543989&s=gateway&sourceid=Mozilla-search&sr=8-13&tag=mozilla-20>", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDZ/4GX3/JSAORROW/FDZ4GX3JSAORROW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0J/P2T1/JSAORRQE/F0JP2T1JSAORRQE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG8/Y42Q/JSAORRSW/FG8Y42QJSAORRSW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: What Is Methyl Cellulose (MC Glue)"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Okay we are finally ready to get this paper made!\nMake sure you made your MC glue beforehand and it is ready to go. If it still has some little white floaties wait a little longer for them to dissolve. I generally leave mine overnight and it is good in the morning.\nLay out the paper so you can see where it will end up and how large it will be.\nroll each piece of tissue paper individually on a cardboard tube. You don't want to do two pieces at a time because it will cause bubbles in the layers and you DON'T want bubbles.\nPour out some of your MC glue onto the glass or other surface you are using. I end up measuring mine and generally 1/2 cup does the job for 3-4 sheets. This stuff is like gold to me so I try to use as much as I can sparingly.\nYou only need to brush on a thin layer on your surface, then immediately roll the tissue onto the surface with MC glue on it. Make sure to apply pressure to stretch and press the paper down so it doesn't have many bubbles.\nApply another sheet on top of that one if you want two-tissue paper thickness.\nThen just keep up that pattern until you have the desired paper thickness. MC glue + tissue paper + MC glue + tissue paper.\nMake sure to thin out any and all bubbles as best you can, but don't get annoyed if you can't, most of them disappear while it dries.\nThe general and most useful thickness is two-tissue, but if you are folding a very complex model, one tissue is very helpful.

But for the most part avoid bubbles ;)\nAnother item to mention is if you get holes. It does happen and I even had it happen to me. It is not the end of the world so don't freak out. This is a technique and, as with all techniques, it takes time and patience to conquer it. If it is the first layer when you put a layer on top of the hole it will disappear.

These spoons are disposable so I like them!\nMixing cups\nHalf Face mask with filters: yeah, this one is important, especially if you meddle with some metal dust, so no skipping on this one, get one:)\nAcrylic and water based paints: these are not art grade ones but colours are good enough :)\nGlue: PVA glue or woodworker glue works just fine.\nMetal powders: we couldn't find any metal powders that cheap in pound shops but they are sold in various sizes and weights online. We got ours from MBFG in you're in UK. `\nSteel wool and teaspoons: I forgot to include steel wool in photos but its also can be found very cheap, we will be using it for polishing along with some spoons:)\nToys, old knick knacks, cheap action figures, miniatures...

I don't use any exact measurement for black wash but it should be very runny, not milky. We are creating some dark areas on details on nooks and crannies, so it won't be a strong contrast on our metallic coat.\n\nif you want to have a good black wash to use for your future projects, follow this tutorial.\nFake patina: If you look at old metal structures and things, you see some greenish blue areas which called as Patina. It's caused by oxidation over time but hey, we can fake that too! All we need is another paint with bluish / greenish colour. (Cyan? Turquise? anyone?)\n\nSimilar to black wash step but this time we add few drops of dish soap instead of PVA glue. This will help to get some tension on previous coats and make a random texture. Go crazy with it; dump your biggest brush into your mix, get all over your figure and leave it dry without making any cleaning. Trust me, it will look amazing when it's done.

I followed this creative method on this but 2 to1 portion wasn't very easy to apply with a brush. So I've added few drops water to my mixture until it gets milky. So start with 2 to 1 portions and if it looks and feels like a bit heavy, start adding water slowly. The more you keep mixing the better and consistent paint you get, take your time.\nPainting:\nOnce the mix is ready, get a small brush and start applying a thin coat, see how it feels. Try to follow the same direction and get into details first. Don't try to get over the areas you've just gone immediately. It will cause some friction and your mix will leave the surface. My brushes were cheap but that was the scope of my challenge; almost all items from cheap stores so my model ended up with a bumpy surface. You may get a better result!\n\nPatience is the key:\nYeah I know, it's boring to wait for your first coat to dry and you want to get it done as soon as possible.

For this one I wanted to use foam insulation (green/blue sheets picked up from your local big box home improvement stores). I recently got a ton of small pieces of this stuff from my job (I am a teacher). My awesome drama teacher buys sheets of this stuff to paint and make into scenery for her plays. After repainting and re-purposing the sheets for multiple productions, she will break them up and put them in trash bags to be recycled later.\nI grabbed two 55 gallon bags of these pieces and took them home.

Knowing this, I stacked my pieces to narrow to wide. I glued them together using regular white glue. If you use this same glue (or even a wood glue will work) make sure you let the pieces dry, thoroughly. Use clamps and/or weights if you can. If you don't allow sufficient time to dry, the individual pieces will want to come apart when you start applying pressure from sanding and shaping. If they come apart, reapply some of the lost glue, reattach, and let dry.\nShaping:\nWhen the pieces were dry, it was time to shape. The tools I used to cut the large portion of the unwanted foam from the piece was a combination of a band saw, razor knife, and foam hot wire. Pretty much if the piece didn't fit in my band saw, I used a razor knife or hot wire to cut the foam. If you don't have a band saw or hot wire, you can use a hand saw, rotary tool with cutting disc, grinder, or just use a razor knife the whole way through.\nSAFETY: Wear a respirator or mask...Dust can get overwhelming\nAfter getting the huge chunks off, it was time to work on some of the smaller shaping. I went for the combo of the foam shaper rasp, belt sander, and palm sander. With the foam rasp, I just scrapped the surface of my pieces till I got to my desired proportion. I then went to my belt sander and smoothed out as much as I couple possibly reach with that piece of machinery. Sanding drum on the drill or oscillating sander would probably be a better tool to use, but I don't have those in my shop, YET. After the belt sander, if I needed any more smoothing, I would use my palm sander. ***Be careful sanding this stuff; one thing, it sands very fast, second it creates a lot of dust, wear your safety equipment.\nNext is Coating", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1J/FPJF/JS0OWS1T/F1JFPJFJS0OWS1T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXQ/1J5M/JS0OWS24/FXQ1J5MJS0OWS24.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB7/C40G/JS0OWS2A/FB7C40GJS0OWS2A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYD/1VEG/JS5CPASA/FYD1VEGJS5CPASA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP4/16CW/JS0OWS2Y/FP416CWJS0OWS2Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWP/LO05/JS0OWS4T/FWPLO05JS0OWS4T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8S/2UK7/JS0OWS55/F8S2UK7JS0OWS55.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3W/N688/JS0OWS5Q/F3WN688JS0OWS5Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTI/EJ63/JS0OWS5F/FTIEJ63JS0OWS5F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX6/O7FO/JS0OWS5K/FX6O7FOJS0OWS5K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDH/8TMG/JS0OWSD3/FDH8TMGJS0OWSD3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL3/YWHM/JS0OWSDC/FL3YWHMJS0OWSDC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Make the Initial Shape of the Piece"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The first coat I put on my tails is a mixture.

I might as well just finger painted them. If you are a better hand painter then go for it. I sanded down my speckled sea trout tail and repainted it using an airbrush.\nAirbrush\nWhat I did before I had an airbrushing...I can't remember and don't want to. I use a cheapo airbrush from Harbor Freight. I use regular acrylic paint, some are metallic, some are color changing. Pick the colors that you would like for your pieces. To prepare and thin the paints, I use blue glass cleaner with ammonia. I take a paper disposal cup, add my colors, mix with a wood tongue depressor. Once I have the color I want, I spray the glass cleaner into the cup and mix till I get a \"milk\" consistency. Start with your dark colors and work to your lighter ones. Practice makes perfect.\nClear Coating\nUsing an airbrush, lets the acrylic paint dry super fast. So by the time you clean up; you put away your paints and equipment, your piece will have more than enough time to dry. I used spray clear gloss acrylic spray. I followed the manufacturer's directions for applying multiple coats. I did 2 coats on each tail.\n\"All about that Base\"\nWhen the clear coat dried, I pulled the tails from their cardboard base and peeled away any hot glue residue. I then hand painted all the bases black, applied my custom rod building logo to the bottom with the date and my initials. After putting my mark on it, I then coated the bottom with one layer of the same acrylic spray from before.\nFrom there you can be done. You put them on display, but I took it one step further.

In the past, I have used this stuff and for the most part its pretty clear with tiny little bit of yellowing, when casting with it. Yellowing for this didn't bother me, because I knew I was going to be using some blue and teal pigment dyes to color the epoxy to look more like water. I also added blue glow-in-the-dark pigment powder for an awesome effect.\nSet Up:\nFor 2 of my fish I used a container the was some what flat/ thin that had a lid. I cut the edge of the lid off so that the top would fit inside the bottom of the container. I then cut the lid so that the tail would be coming up through the lid. To make the water ripple effect in the epoxy, I took my hot glue gun and ran lines on the bottom of the lid.\nFor the other 2 fish, Small redfish and speckled sea trout, I had to come up with a different, more radical display of the water, because of how I set them up. I was thinking of a splash effect. So I used a cup for the sea trout and a plastic bowls for the small redfish. The idea is that I could take hot glue and replicate the splash. Pour the epoxy in to the mold, where it would fill up around the hot glue.\nCaution***: Test your hypothesis before flat out trying it on your pieces. Also COVER EVERYTHING THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE WATER (EPOXY) ON WITH SOME TYPE OF DEMOLDER. I used a combination of petroleum jelly and actually demolding spray to coat my pieces. Combination... Basically any flat surface like the bottom of the base of the container I would use the petroleum jelly. For all the nooks and crevices, like from the hot glue, I would spray with the demolding spray.\nGet your pieces ready, mix your epoxy to what is recommended by the manufacturer, add your dye, and pour.

You can always add more bronze paint and activator to add to the effect if it's not to your liking. At this point, I wanted to take the process further and refine the piece. The activator I used created a blue patina which I thought was a bit too bright for the look I was going for.\nI decided to apply a green \u201cwash\u201d to enhance the patina, add depth and tone down that blue color! A wash is simply a watered down layer of paint applied to the piece. The Hauser Medium Green most resembled green patina to me. I applied the paint with a water saturated brush. Use small amounts of paint applied basically where ever the blue patina had formed. If you apply a bit too much paint, just wet your brush and dilute the area of paint spreading it out and watering it down.\nThe other effect the green wash has is to dull down the colors making a more natural appearance. I also lightly applied the Worn Penny metallic paint in a very diluted wash focusing on high points like Santa\u2019s nose, beard and arms \u2013 areas that would be bright points or areas that would suggest handling or buffing through contact.\nWhile I was working on the Santa, I decided to paint an extra Cthulhu I printed when I made the one for my son. On this one, I added the Brushed Bronze and Worn Penny acrylic paints after the primer and first coat of Metal Effects bronze paint, and before the final bronze coat and activator. I wanted an extra layer of metallic finish. I randomly applied the two paints not wanting to fully coat the surfaces, but just provide highlights that peek through the final finish.\nOn the Cthulhu statue, I think a better, deeper finish was obtained. So, I would recommend applying the metallic paint between the Metal Effects bronze coats and before the patina coat. The Santa still came out great, but took a bit more work to get the same look.

You could use the metallic paint I used earlier, but the best product to use is Rub\u2019n Buff. There are many varieties to choose from, but I like the Spanish Copper for dark notes and Grecian Gold to add polished highlights to the piece.\nA little Rub\u2019n Buff goes a long way. I like to dole out a pea-sized drop of each color onto a work surface, then smear it out flat on one end. Also, best to use rubber gloves for this part. Rub\u2019n Buff is wax based and takes a bit of scrubbing to get off\u2026 Start with the dark color. Smear a thin layer on your finger from the drop you put down and lightly add the color to your piece. For the Santa, I focused on his back, arms and hat - areas that would show more of the original metal and not hold as much patina through simulated handling. I also hit the mittens, belt and boots. You will have to \u201creload\u201d your finger frequently. That\u2019s good, you don\u2019t want to put too much on at a time. Once you\u2019ve added the color, take a rag (don\u2019t use a paper towel like I did\u2026.it shreds to pieces!) and generously buff the color into the piece. Because Rub\u2019n Buff is wax based, it doesn\u2019t really come off when you buff it. It basically spreads out and works its way into the pores and crevices of the piece.\nDon\u2019t use a lot of this product at a time. Work it into the piece in small doses. You can always add more. Adding too much at a time can overpower the look, but don\u2019t worry if you do add too much, you\u2019ll just have to keep buffing.\nAfter the Spanish Copper, I added the Grecian Gold (very sparingly, a little at a time) to add bright highlights to the piece.

I take it as a creative challenge to work the major updates from the year into the design in some way and tend to lean into whatever tools I have available to me that year.\n\nIn general, I tend to do more woodworking and gardening, so this is a refreshing project to get more into the graphic design space and play with paper. I had never made a pop-up card before and thought the extra dimension would be delightful to those on our Christmas card list!\n\nFor this card, we had moved from San Francisco to London - two cities with iconic bridges. I admit I was so excited about the idea of working out a version of the Golden Gate and Tower Bridge that would work in cut paper that I used that as a design constraint. I worked the rest of the theme around this idea I just couldn't let go of, but it worked really well in the end. Sometimes you get an idea that grabs you and stick with it.\n\nThe other breakthrough was using the two colors as accents for each other, which is an idea I'd encourage others to play with in your concepts. Red is so essential to the Golden Gate Bridge that reversing the colors seemed like blasphemy, but I tried it both ways and this really worked.\n\nI'll walk through my process here and share some thoughts with you about lessons learned at the end. I hope you take this inspiration for your own card concepts!", "title": "Pop-up Laser Cut Christmas Cards", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Pop-up-Laser-Cut-Christmas-Cards/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "In my sketchbook while on the tube, I quickly explored many concepts about how to recap the year before landing on this bridge concept. Rough pencil sketching is great to do before you more to digital tools. It's fun and fast. Feel free to look to other places for inspiration but don't discount your own creativity.\n\nFrom there, I started working in my vector program of choice, Adobe Illustrator. If you're going to be using a laser cutter for cutting and not just etching (more on this in a bit!) you'll need to draw out the geometries you wish to cut instead of copying photos for the laser cutter to work from.\n\nI worked through this in batches and cut scraps often throughout the process to get a sense of scale, cut, appropriate detail, and if the text I was using was readable with the etching. If you're new to making things on the laser cutter or even making a project outside of your regular wheelhouse, I'd go in with the expectation that you'll need some time on the machine followed by some heads-down time at the computer to adjust your files based on what you learn before finishing your project.\n\nLastly, before getting into raster vs vector, you'll notice the screenshots above show two different colors in my .ai file. I used a separate program called CorelDraw (see the last image) to translate my .ai file to the laser cutter and it reads line thickness as well as RGB values. These designs are specifically called out in red, black, blue, and cyan to communicate to the laser exactly what power, speed, frequency of the laser, and number of passes of the laser on a very specific level. Each setup will be slightly different - I wanted to call out detail that might not be clear in the screenshots.\n\nPro tip: What's the difference between raster etching and vector cutting on a laser cutter?\nThe laser is a printer that prints with heat. It first prints all your raster data, similar to an ink jet printer that prints with ink, putting down \u201cdots of heat\u201d instead of ink. It then moves like a plotter and follows your vector paths to draw or carve them into your material.\nRaster data is made of pixels. File types of jpg, gif, png, and bmp are all examples of raster data. Images that come from your camera or scanner are also raster data. The laser varies the amount of heat delivered for each pixel, resulting in what looks like a photo burned into your material.\nVector data is expressed via equations. Straight lines, circles, rectangles, splines, hand drawn squiggly curves are all examples of vector data.\nThe above is true from the perspective of software applications that handle vector and raster data. The laser treats the data slightly differently.\nFor the laser, all data is treated as raster data except for vector data that also has a line thickness of \u201chairline\u201d. \u201cHairline\u201d is the smallest non-zero value possible for vectors in several applications used to send files to the lasers. If you develop your artwork in another application, choose the smallest non-zero thickness available and your data will typically import as hairline thickness.\nJust because you\u2019re using vector data doesn\u2019t mean you must cut through. You can score cardboard to mark the fold likes to make it into a box. Conversely, just because you\u2019re using raster data doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t etch through.\nAnd remember - each method has the capacity to produce a fire. Always watch your work!\n\nBONUS:I used to teach people how to safely use a laser cutter at a community maker space. I wrote our manual for the safety course and I'm including it here for anyone who would like to learn more. You'll need to refresh on the specific of whatever machine you may have access to, but this will give you a nice foundation if you're curious.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOX/P11L/JS5C2E13/FOXP11LJS5C2E13.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTZ/M23V/JS5C2O0Y/FTZM23VJS5C2O0Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZI/SAFX/IGTYA1NI/FZISAFXIGTYA1NI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Sketch & Design"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Prep your paper, do your test cuts, and start cranking out the pieces on the laser cutter.\n\nAs you test, write down your test settings in a notebook or, better yet, jot them directly on the test cuts so you can see what different etching and cutting finishing looks like! You'll want to refer to your numbers as you progress.\n\nNote: General rule of thumb is that raster etching takes far, far longer than vector cutting on a material like paper. For raster etching, the laser will move back and forth like an ink printer at the rough thickness of the laser over whatever your design is, while the vector cuts follow the design's curves so it's a faster tracing.\n\nHere in detailed photo, you can see the vector cut of the golden gate bridge in the red paper before the raster etching has taken place.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDX/HLA4/IGTYA1RV/FDXHLA4IGTYA1RV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU8/PYNY/IGTYA1OV/FU8PYNYIGTYA1OV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBT/K2F2/IGTYA1NF/FBTK2F2IGTYA1NF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Prep & Cut"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Remove your paper from the laser cutter.

Pinch the wool together with your left hand and spin your spindle clockwise. Whenever you are not spinning hold the spindle between your knees to stop you yarn from unwinding. To continue spinning, take your right hand and pinch the yarn right under where your left hand was. With your left hand gently pull on the un-spun yarn until it is at your desired thickness. Pinch the un-spun wool with your left hand about 1 or 2 inches away from where your right hand is pinching the wool. Let go of the wool in your right hand. You should see the twist travel up the yarn. Keep spinning your spindle clockwise until you feel the twist travel up to where the yarn is pinched in your left hand. Then you repeat that process until you cant lift your arm any higher to keep spinning. At this point you will need to take the yarn you have spun and wind it around the spindle under the worl. This can be a little bit tricky when you first wind on a new bit of yarn, but after it gets a lot easier. You are also going to need to leave enough yarn unwound so you can bring it back up to the hook and wrap the yarn around the hook a few times before you can start spinning again. When you run out of wool you are going to need to attach more. To attach more wool, take the wool already on the spindle and fan out the un-spun bit at the end. Then take another bit of pre-drafted wool and attach the end of that to the \"fluffy\" part of the wool on the spindle. Pinch them together and spin the spindle clockwise until the 2 pieces of wool are attached. And then repeat!\nRemember, your yarn is going to be uneven and lumpy at first. That's okay!

The yarn you have currently spun on your spindle is called singles, which will twist up on themselves if there isn't any tension applied to them. Plying takes 2 different singles and spins them together to make one length of yarn.\nBefore you can start plying you are going to need to wind your single onto something else, which is called a bobbin. Empty toilet paper rolls work great for this, but basically and cylinder you can wrap your yarn around will work. I've even used empty pill bottles to wind my yarn onto. You are going to need two bobbins before you can ply them. There are ways to ply a one single but today I will just be talking about how to ply two singles together.\nYou are going to want to have some way to keep your two bobbins separated before you start spinning them together. There a things specifically made for this, but something like 2 buckets to put the bobbins in would also work. You will see in my photo that I just have my bobbins loose on a table, don't do this, it just makes things more difficult.\nOnce you have your 2 bobbins ready take the 2 ends of your singles and attach them to the hook of your spindle.

This step isn't totally necessary but it helps make your yarn softer and more fluffy.\nFirst you need to make your length of yarn into a skein. You can use a tool like a niddy noddy, of you can just use your arm like I do. Hold the end of your yarn between your thumb and pointer finger and wrap the yarn under your elbow and back up to where you started. Keep wrapping until you are out of yarn.\nLay your skein down on a table. You are going to need to tie it up in sections so it doesn't get tangled when you soak it. I usually tie my skein up in 4ths. Take a section of your skein and split the yarn approximately in half. Take a bit of scrap yarn that is in a contrasting color to your yarn and tie a figure 8 around your skein like in the photos above.\nNext fill a container with warm water. There needs to be enough to fully submerge the yarn. Put your yarn in the warm water and push it under until fully soaked. Leave the yarn in the water for 10-30 minutes. After the time is up take out the yarn and gently squeeze out the water. To get out more of the water wrap the yarn in a towel like a burrito and press or step on it.\nThis next part is not always necessary but its my favorite part of the process. Take the yarn out of the towel and hold one end firmly in one hand. Then take the yarn and smack it against a table of a wall as hard as you can. Rotate what end you are holding frequently and keep smacking the yarn against a surface for a few minutes. This fluffs the yarn, but it is also just a great way to get out any aggression.\nThen just let the yarn hang out to dry.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F86/R6DS/JS0OV5E6/F86R6DSJS0OV5E6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH3/IHI1/JS0OV5EC/FH3IHI1JS0OV5EC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5K/67BQ/JS0OV5EJ/F5K67BQJS0OV5EJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFX/359U/JS0OV5EO/FFX359UJS0OV5EO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F50/D0ME/JS0OV5F5/F50D0MEJS0OV5F5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUL/3GNJ/JS0OV5F6/FUL3GNJJS0OV5F6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F73/B88V/JS0OV5FB/F73B88VJS0OV5FB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD6/X06T/JS0OV5FC/FD6X06TJS0OV5FC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNA/M3TX/JS0OV5FD/FNAM3TXJS0OV5FD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZL/4S34/JS0OV5FG/FZL4S34JS0OV5FG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Setting the Twist"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Then you are done!

It will feel tight on the needles for a few rows, but don\u2019t worry. As you knit along, it will feel more comfortable. To begin, you will want to add 3 stitches on each side for the underarm. When you knit the first row, cast on 3 stitches at the end of the row. When you knit the second row, cast on 3 stitches at the end of the row. Maintain the cable pattern in this way:\n1. Knit all rows in garter stitch (knit stitch on each side) except for:\na. Purl all cable stitches and knit 2 edge stitches on wrong side.\nb. Knit all cable stitches and purl 2 edge stitches on the right side.\n2. Every 6th row (right side), with the exception of the first twist which will happen on the 5th row from when you start knitting, twist the cable stitches.\na. The left sleeve requires twisting from the back, which means: place 3 stitches on cable needle in the back, K3, then knit the three stitches from the cable needle\nb. The right sleeve requires twisting from the front, which means: place 3 stitches on cable needle in front, K3, knit the 3 stitches from cable needle.\nRemember to alternate the color of the edge stitches to ensure the cable remains attached to the rest of the sleeve. Continue this pattern while decreasing two stitches every 1.5 cm. I did this by knitting two stitches together at the start and end of each row. You will make this decrease 8 times. Then continue knitting until the sleeve is 15 cm long, the typical sleeve measurement for a baby sweater of this size.\nTo match the neck and the bottom lining of the sweater, knit 6 rows in rib stitch by alternating knit and purl stitches.

White reflects light the best, but if you choose to use another colour, that is up to you!\nPlace (don't tape) your image where you would like it on your white paper. Using a pencil, mark where you would like the LED to be. Tip: hiding the LED behind the paper will look nicer than placing the light directly behind the plastic. as it will create a glowing effect rather than a sharp light effect.\nPunch 2 small holes the diameter and width of the LED prongs using a pin.\nOn the back of the paper, you will use your copper tape to act as wires that will connect the LED to the battery. For a simple card with one LED, you can use a simple circuit, which means connecting the LED from the positive end of the LED to the negative end. You can only do this with one LED as the 3V battery can only light one 3V LED in this kind of circuit. You can use the same process as noted below with a parallel circuit for more LEDs, but I will keep this Instructable simple.\nCut a piece of paper the width of the battery and more than double the length to create a rectangle. See #9 as to why we need this paper longer than the battery. 1cm longer should be enough.\nFold the paper in half. This is where the battery will be sandwiched. If you need to, you can trace the battery shape onto the inside of the fold.\nUsing the double-sided tape, tape the folded rectangle where you would like the battery to go (I recommend the corner of the paper with the open side of the fold facing the edge of the paper). Pressing the battery down will activate the light, so put it where you would like the recipient to press. The upper or bottom right is a good place.\nFrom one hole that was made for the LED, stick the copper tape down and lead it to where the battery will go. This should lead to the opened taped-down section of the \"sandwich\". If you need to create a corner, you can easily do that by pressing the tape to the corner of where you need to make the turn, turning the tape in the opposite direction of where you intend it to go and pressing down, then continuing to follow the direction you need to go in. See the image where there are corners. If it doesn't look clean, that's okay! People won't see it. Just make sure not to tear the tape. This is the instructions for how I made the bottom link to the circuit in the picture. The tape must cover the space where the battery will go.\nDo the same thing as #4 but for the other hole for the LED. Lead this copper tape along the open folded piece of paper you made and around to the other side (see picture).\nBend the legs of the LED at a 90-degree angle. Fit your LED prongs through the holes. Bending the legs first will allow the LED sit flatter against the card and will allow the light to disperse more. The LED should sit sideways once pushed through the holes (see image of card from side).\nBend the legs of the LED back and tape them down so that each leg is touching a different piece of copper tape (see picture)\nPlace your battery down where you wanted it to go (in the paper sandwich). Press down to make sure that your LED lights up. If it doesn't light up, flip the battery around to make sure the positive and negative ends are matching. If it still doesn't work, make sure a piece of copper tape is touching both sides of the battery and both ends of the LED. Make sure the legs of the LED aren't touching any other pieces of copper tape as it would interrupt the circuit.\nOnce you know your LED can light up, place double-sided tape on one end of your foam and cut it into narrow strips. Use small strips of foam to cushion your battery. This should hold the battery firmly in place and will give it space so that it the circuit isn't activated unless the battery is pushed.\nTape the flap of the folded paper down with regular tape - but not too tightly as to activate the LED without pressing down. This is why we cut the rectangle longer than the battery.\nThis part is done! Once you get the hang of this, it will go by very quickly if you choose to create multiple cards.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5J/JVE2/JROTPX0O/F5JJVE2JROTPX0O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDZ/4R2F/JROTPX0X/FDZ4R2FJROTPX0X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB9/WGZU/JROTQ5RC/FB9WGZUJROTQ5RC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD5/SQTR/JROTQ5Y4/FD5SQTRJROTQ5Y4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Prepare the Light(s)"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Attach double-sided tape to both sides of some foam and cut small strips of it.\nAttach the foam to the back of your image (the plastic and paper one) in a few places to make it sit higher than the LED (see photo of the card turned sideways).\nAttach the image to the front of the white paper where you attached your LED where you wanted it to sit (the LED side, not circuit side).\nCheck to make sure the circuit still works when the battery is pressed.\nUsing double-sided tape, attach this sheet to the card you made.\nThe card is now done and ready to give!

In my example, we are doing the diamond which was 1\" wide and 2\" tall. The thickness isn't as important right now as you can change it whenever you want.\nTake this shape and make it a hole. Also, make a large square. It doesn't have to be a certain size, just large enough that it can cut off the ends of your rectangles later, but mine is 4\" by 4\". Make it solid.\nLine the shapes up so the cutout is in the center and group them.\nNow you have the earring shape.\nTurn it into a hole.\nTime for the rectangles.\nSo, this design evolved over time, but in the end, I ended up with an earring design that consisted of rectangles that are the same length and width but different heights. I split the rectangles up into 5 heights and decided they would be two different colors (depending on layer height).\nThe plan was that the 1st, 3rd, and 5th layers to be one color and the 2nd and 4th layers to be another. Meaning, I needed the same number of rectangles split between layers 1,3,5 and 2,4.\nTo make sure my color coverage was good, I colored the layers so I could see where the colors would show up and where they would be overlapped and covered.\nMy goal was for each color to be 2 layers when sliced, meaning the first color went up 2 layers, the second color showed up 4 layers, third was 6 layers, forth was 8 layers and fifth was 10 layers.\nLayers/Rectangles: (18 total with 9 of each color) below is # of rectangles, which color, and height\n3 - color 1 - .5 mm\n5 - color 2 - .9 mm\n3 - color 1 - 1.3 mm\n4 - color 2 - 1.7 mm\n3 - color 1 - 2.1 mm\nThis is probably confusing, but the design changed so it's a little difficult to explain how to go from the image above to the one below.\nThe goal was to make sure the colors were spaced well enough that you could see about an equal amount of each. I started with each color a different layer so I could see where everything was.\nThen, I checked everything by coloring the layers appropriately. So 1, 3, and 5 one color with 2 and 4 another color.\nFrom here, I moved rectangles around until I was happy with the layout. Pay attention to how much of each color you can see and how the edges of the shape look. You want to try to avoid huge gaps that detract from the shape. For example, I tried to make sure the rectangles went out at the diamond points so I would have that definition. Also, make sure you have some definition at the top so you'll be able to attach the loop.\nGroup the rectangles and the shape cutout. If you don't like the look, ungroup and keep moving things around.\nThe last thing to do is add a loop. When I can, I prefer to add a hole into the design to make it look more natural, but the thinness of these lines didn't allow it. So, I added on a loop that was made from a cylinder that was 2.68mm in diameter and had a hole that was 1.50mm in diameter.\nI made sure everything was centered and connected, then I grouped them.\nTo finish off your earrings, I recommend, copying it and mirroring it. I prefer this to two earrings the same, but it's a personal preference.\nNow you have a set of earrings. You can repeat this process for any shape you'd like.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQD/5TUZ/JRKZ5P1P/FQD5TUZJRKZ5P1P.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Layered Rectangles"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "In this step, I'm going to talk about, not only how I made the broken heart that fits together, but how I got the rectangle/lines to match up between the pieces as well.\nTo begin with, you need a heart that is the hight you want the earring and about double the width (since we'll be cutting it in half).\nBring in some squares and make them into holes. I turned them 45 degrees and then started messing with their shape and orientation.\nBelow you can see how I ultimatly had the squares shaped. One thing I wanted to try to do here was get the shapes to line up with the tip of the heart on the bottom and the dip in the heart on the top to get a clean cut.\nGroup these shapes together with the heart.\nOnce I had the cutout, I needed to get rid of the rest of the heart on that side. I just pulled in a square and distorted it until it covered all the bits. Group.\nNow I had one half of the heart. I copied it and made the copy into a cutout.\nNext, line the cutout with the left and top side of the full heart. Group together.\nNow there are two halves that fit together perfectly. If you don't like the way things look here, undo and change up the way the shapes cut into the first half until you like it.\nLook, they line up!\nNow, do what you did in the last step with both of these halves so you have cutouts for each earring.\nLine them up so they are almost perfectly lined up.\nThis next part got pretty messy but I had to bring over the rectangles from one of the other earrings I did and started moving them around. I wanted them to kind of line up with the cuts along the middle so I could get a good outline for both sides. Also, I wanted to try to keep the number of rectangles even on both sides of the heart. This took quite a bit of moving things around. I wanted to make sure the rectangles stayed on their own side of the heart but also had some that went all the way across so you could see that they lined up together.\nTo make it easier to do this, I took the heart cutouts and moved them down out of the way.\nOnce I was done, I had to bring the cutout back up to 0.\nTo get the separate sides/hearts, I copied everything and moved it out of the way. Then, I deleted one side on each. So for the left, I deleted the right heart, for the right side I deleted the left heart.\nBelow you can see the individual hearts. Group these.\nMake sure nothing is hanging out on this own. All parts need to be connected. At this point, see if you like how the individual heart sides look. If not, you need to undo until you are back to having one set of everything and move the rectangles around until you are happy.\nNow that I had the hearts, it was time to add the loops as I did in the last step. I originally tried to line everything up in the middle, but then I moved things if I had to to make sure the loop attached to the heart. For the heart on the right, I had to move the loop over a bit so it stayed connected.\nTwo beautiful pieces of a broken heart.\nTime to slice!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2M/D5O7/JRKZ5P3U/F2MD5O7JRKZ5P3U.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: How to Make a 3D Print Broken Heart"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "I'm using Simplify3D but Cura is free and has a lot of things you can adjust and should work as well.\nThe important things to keep in mind are:\n100% infill\n1 Outline\n35% Outline Overlap\nColor Changes before layers 3, 5, 7, and 9.

I got too frustrated and my supplies sat fo a long time before I decided to give it all away thinking I\u2019d never touch art again. Fast forward a few years to now and I find myself with the desire to paint again-maybe nor acrylics, but something. Art supplies can get expensive so since I am venturing into this again I want to keep th cost minimal. I tried just painting on a desk but after a few hours your neck begins to hurt and if you already have a bad neck the pain almost is unbearable. So I started to look for DIY easels.\n\nMy requirements were, it needs to be strong because you push pastels into paper, and I wanted it to be storable. I have too many hobby\u2019s so I needed to be able to put this away when needed. And of course it needs to be inexpensive and materials easy to come by.\n\nI found a plan on YouTube by The Frugal Artist. It looked like something easy to build, low cost and sturdy. But there was only plans, and he talks about what he did but there were not any pictures of the final product. I\u2019m a person that loves pictures, so it a bummer I couldn\u2019t see real pictures of this being made.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve made this easel, and used it (which works beautifully), I thought maybe I should share the details.\n\nMany thanks to The Frugal Artist on YouTube!

I will show you how to construct a pattern for one sock. You can either make a universal pattern for both feet or make two and adjust each to one foot.\nTake a look at the first 2 pictures above before you start. You'll get an idea about the pieces of the pattern. The first picture shows the boot sock from the side, the second picture shows it from the front. The dots are the grommets but more about them later. What you'll need for one sock:\n- 2 front pieces\n- 1 back piece\n- 1 top piece\n- 1 sole piece (not in the pictures)\nSole\nStart with the sole. Step on the paper and trace your foot, adding 2 cm on each side. So in total the sole piece should be 4 cm longer and wider than your foot. Adjust the tracing to be either universal or left/right. Then cut it out. (picture 3)\nTop\nContinue with the top piece. Step on the paper again and trace the piece as shown in the photos. As you can see in the first picture, the top of the larger curve should be approximately over your index toe while the top of the smaller curve (green dot) should be about where the instep turns into the ankle (or little below). Make this piece 2 cm longer in the front than your foot. The piece I cut out is not a result of one tracing. I had to adjust, redraw and cut several times. (pictures 4 and 5)\nWhen you trace it for the first time, place it on the sole piece - leave the sole flat and place the top piece on it to see if and how much to adjust it and also mark on the sole where the edges of the top piece are. You can also tape the two pieces together (later you cut them again to use the to trace on the fabric). Picture 6 shows what it looks like when you mark the edges.\nFront and back\nLet's continue with the front piece and back piece (picture 7). To trace the front piece measure the length from the top of the small curve (green dot) to where you want the sock to reach - I wanted the sock to end just below my knee. If you want to create the rolled edge, add some 4 cm. And as for the width, that should be the distance between the top of the small curve and the edge of the top piece (blue arrows in picture 4).\nAs you can see in one of the pictures, the bottom edge of the front piece is a curve. Also, you need two front pieces for one sock but it's actually enough to cut just one. When you trace it on the fabric later, you just trace them mirroring each other.\nAnd now for the back piece. Measuring the height it simple, use the height of the front piece (its longer side) and add the length of the edges of the top piece (purple line in picture 8). And the width of the back piece should be the distance between the edge of the top piece (orange arrow in picture 8 or the edge that you marked earlier on our sole piece - picture 9) and the center of the heel on the sole piece. This way you'll make half of the back piece which is enough because you'll then cut the fabric on fold and thus make the width of the piece double.\nNow you have all the pattern pieces you need. I recommend you to tape them together and see if everything fits nicely.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFL/XFSJ/JRBBSO00/FFLXFSJJRBBSO00.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAN/FI49/JRBBSO0E/FANFI49JRBBSO0E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO6/0QT3/JRBBSPOA/FO60QT3JRBBSPOA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWV/P13Y/JRBBSNXS/FWVP13YJRBBSNXS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUR/KDXG/JRBBSNYI/FURKDXGJRBBSNYI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR7/MJDA/JRBBSNWV/FR7MJDAJRBBSNWV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPM/Q1QH/JRBBSNYT/FPMQ1QHJRBBSNYT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGW/36QA/JRBBSNY1/FGW36QAJRBBSNY1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ7/J3QA/JRBBSNWW/FZ7J3QAJRBBSNWW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Create the Pattern"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Outside fabric\nCut for one sock:\n- 1 sole piece according to the pattern\n- 1 top piece according to the pattern + add 1 cm to the edges (purple lines) and in the curve\n- 2 front pieces mirroring each other according to the pattern + add 1 cm on both sides (width) and at the bottom end (curve)\n- 1 back piece cut on fold according to patter + add 1 cm on both long sides\nCutting the lining\nFor one sock cut the same pieces like from the outside fabric.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBW/1069/JRBBSO0F/FBW1069JRBBSO0F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4P/Z7AY/JRBBSNZE/F4PZ7AYJRBBSNZE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Cutting the Fabric"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The seam allowance is 1 cm (so sew 1 cm from the edges) and you can either serge and then run through it with a straight stitch or use a normal zigzag and then the straight stitch.\nBefore I got down to sewing I decorated the fabric with the Amish stumpwork.

I recommend to do this only if you don't want to roll the edges of your socks later. (photo 5)\n2. Fold the edges of both fabrics inside and stitch with the hidden stitch. The tutorial is here.

This idea started when I was trying to make a 3D diamond with cutouts. I want to revisit it, but the trouble I had printing it led me to abandon it. When I decided to work on the rupee, I decided what I needed to to make it work this time, was create two pieces that are meant to be glued together instead of trying to print it as one piece.\nI did tests and kept going back to make adjustments to make sure it would slice and print the best I could get it. Meaning I needed lines to be completed and sections to not be too small. I'm going to go through this very basically with step by step instructions, but the actual process to get to the finished design included many tests, reprints, and redesigns.\nDesigning\nTo begin with, I started with 2 triangles and a square as the base. I could have used a hexagon but with three separate shapes I had more control over the size and this helped me get the sizes right for the shapes in the next step. The pieces are 0.24mm thick and the whole shape is about 16.20mm by 29.10mm. Also, I started with these basic shapes instead of starting with the next step/image because I wanted to ensure I had at least 1 layer that was a sturdy base.\nNow to give it depth we are going to use 2 pyramids and a roof shape. Because I knew the exact size of the base pieces all I needed was to make the roof the same length and width of the square while the pyramids needed to be the same width and twice the height of the triangles. When overlapped right, I got a nice 3D rupee shape.\nNow I have the 3D rupee (SHAPE A).\nTime to make the cutouts. I used distorted roofs with the tops cut off with rectangles to make cutouts for the top and bottom ends.\nFor the center, I just needed a rectangle cutout.\nMake sure everything is lined up right. I tend to use align a lot and the ruler.\nNow I have all the side cutouts, but I still have the bottom and top to cut.\nTo cut out the bottom, I copied my shape and kept ungrouping until I had the original 3D rupee shape (what I labeled SHAPE A above). I shrank this down until I was happy with the wall thicknesses and then made it into a hole to cut out the bottom and inside of the rupee.\nLastly, I needed to cut the top. This was pretty easy, I just took a rectangle and brought it up so the rupee would be as thick as I needed it and grouped to cut the top.\nNow I have the rupee, but I need a hole for attaching a jump ring.

Since I know we won't have the same materials and charms, get creative, and really make your dragon your own!\nThe one part I will explain is the eye. I used two 1/2 inch metal marbles and glued them into the socket. Then I cut two pieces of leather in the shape of two \"C\"s, and hemmed them with glue. These were the top and bottom eyelids of the dragon. I covered the connection with a spider charm, but any charm will work.\nThe main supplies I used were:\n1\" rivets under the eyes\nChess pieces rubbed with Rub-n-Buff on the sides of the mouth and head\nOld Circuit Boards on the back of the head.\nWire sticking off the back\nOld, uncurled, watch springs that attached by the neck\nCharms, old jewelry, gears", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FT0/PBOS/JR6OI30W/FT0PBOSJR6OI30W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTZ/8SC9/JRAYMTVO/FTZ8SC9JRAYMTVO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZI/9SPL/JR6OI37G/FZI9SPLJR6OI37G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F67/7SR1/JR6OI3A1/F677SR1JR6OI3A1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX7/PUK2/JRAYMTVQ/FX7PUK2JRAYMTVQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2Z/A6UG/JRAYMTVR/F2ZA6UGJRAYMTVR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWI/ZACP/JRAYMTVY/FWIZACPJRAYMTVY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7S/73ZB/JRAYMTWN/F7S73ZBJRAYMTWN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPO/HPHP/JRAYMTWO/FPOHPHPJRAYMTWO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 11: The Eyes and Decorations!"}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "LAST STEP!!

Grown-ups need their toys too; we're all just kids at heart!\nWith Amigurumi trending on Instagram and Pinterest, I was curious to try my hand at it. It's been over 20 years since I picked up a crochet hook, and I've never created a pattern before, but I'm always up for a challenge!\nI ran out to the dollar store to find light and dark green yarn just to practice and got the last skeins! I had leftover scraps of white yarn, fibrefill, beads and embroidery thread in my craft stash so my prototype cost me a whopping $2.50! I intended to buy better yarn for my second one but was happy with the yarn I found at the dollar store (it's a cotton blend).\nSome tips before we start:\nPlace a marker at the beginning of each row. That way you can keep track of where you are if you get distracted. I just use a bobby pin; no need for a fancy marker!\nCount your stitches! There are stitch counts at the end of each row in this Instructable. Be sure to double check that you have the right amount of stitches before moving on.

It is a very simple, but very strong stitch that is often used in leather working.\nHow do you saddle stitch leather?\nPut one needle through, and grab both needles and pull upward until you have an even amount of thread on both sides.\nThen, start about 2 stitch holes forward from where the end of your row is. This is called a back stitch. The reason is you want to do a back stitch to lock in your stitching. Then, insert one end of your thread (with a needle on both ends, remember?) and pull upward with both ends until they are even.\n\nChoose which side will be your front side and keep that in mind. That's important later since you will be tying things off and you want things to look great on the front. Put one of the needles through the next hole back from the one the thread is in now, and put it through both pieces of leather. For this example, I'm going to say I'm starting at my right hand, and pushing the needle through to the left side. The other needle is in my left hand, between my thumb and forefinger. Bring the needle in the left hand underneath the other needle, and perpendicular to the one coming through the leather, forming a cross.\nPull the first needle through the work piece, rotate 90 degrees clockwise, and put the second needle (the one that has been in the left hand) back through the same hole. Grab that needle with your right hand, and pull it all the way through. Once it is all of the way through, grab both ends of the thread and pull the stitching tight. You want it snug, but don't pull so tight that you deform the leather. Keep doing this all the way down until you reach the end of your row. Once you reach the end, repeat the above steps to create a back stitch, going back a couple of holes. Then, take the needle that's on the \"finished\" side, and put it back through to the \"back\" side. that way, you don't have loose threads showing from the face of your work piece. At this point, you're done with the thread for this row. I actually tied a couple of small knots on the back side, but that's not completely necessary since I did the back stitch. For this particular handle and project, I just repeated these same steps for the other row that needed stitching.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTG/YGU4/JR6OGBR0/FTGYGU4JR6OGBR0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS3/IJ9K/JR6OGBS5/FS3IJ9KJR6OGBS5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9P/OFE0/JR6OGBTA/F9POFE0JR6OGBTA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F75/MFST/JR6OGBTB/F75MFSTJR6OGBTB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRT/M6QP/JR6OGBTC/FRTM6QPJR6OGBTC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX4/7I1G/JR6OGBTD/FX47I1GJR6OGBTD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPX/9GTR/JR6OGBTY/FPX9GTRJR6OGBTY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F89/T4U9/JR6OGBTZ/F89T4U9JR6OGBTZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: SADDLE STITCHING"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "After cleaning up the short ends a bit (cutting them square) and using an edge beveler tool to kind of round over the edge, it was time to do some edge treatment.\nSome people sand the edges of their projects, but some don't. I think I want to work on my burnishing techniques so that I don't have to do as much sanding. A friend who does a lot more leather working than I do told me that he doesn't even sand the edges on most projects.\nThere are a number of ways to burnish the edges of leather. I've experimented with a couple of them. I have used glycerin saddle soap that I rub on after wetting the edge. That has worked ok for the few things I've done. I also tried just using water, and then the slicker tool. That seemed to work just as well. I've heard that using some wax can also help get a great result. The way burnishing the edge works is the friction from rubbing a slicker tool back and forth, and the water or whatever other medium, causes some head to build up. This allows the ends to get a nice, slick look and feel.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSU/UQWD/JR6OGC7W/FSUUQWDJR6OGC7W.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: EDGE TREATMENT"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "I decided I wanted to wet form this leather handle into an arched shape.

I erased the sunnies line (as shown) because I didn\u2019t need to cut it \u2013 may not need to do this depending on your design.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7I/TS42/JR0YRCYB/F7ITS42JR0YRCYB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F96/70MC/JR4TEFYU/F9670MCJR4TEFYU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRF/GTTW/JR4TEFYY/FRFGTTWJR4TEFYY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Y/HX98/JR4TEFYV/F8YHX98JR4TEFYV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1V/A5OY/JR4TEGIK/F1VA5OYJR4TEGIK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Sketch"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Ok, time for the littler details! Here is a HUGE tip that you CAN NOT ignore!\nWhen you cut out your design be VERY CAREFUL. Why? Because anything \u2018floating\u2019 \u2013 that is, anything not connected to the edges will fall out. This is a very sad happening and you should avoid it by all costs. If you still don\u2019t understand, go to the picture where I have added the criss-crosses on my pineapple and see how some touch the sides and some don\u2019t to avoid forming block which would fall out of the design. Again, this is so hard to explain in words so check out the picture. If you do have \u2018floating\u2019 bits, connect them with little tabs that are attached to the edge.\nNow that we have (maybe) rescued your design we can work on the \u2018parts\u2019. As you can see in my picture the sunnies have divided the pineapple into 2 parts. What this means is that the pineapple will be cut out in two chunks \u2013 it may not matter to your design but now you know!\nTime to add inner detail. Our inner detail were the criss-crosses. They needed to be attached to the edges, so they didn\u2019t fall out in view of them being laptop case material instead of paint.\nLess is more. This is the reason I have erased some of my criss-crosses and made them larger instead. It looks cleaner, more minimalistic/modern and it also looks a lot less cluttered (it\u2019s easier to cut out too!)\nX-ing! Mark each part you will be cutting out with small X\u2019s. This will prevent you from cutting the wrong things (which is really sad)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRY/ZSE5/JR4TEGML/FRYZSE5JR4TEGML.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV1/NXXY/JR4TEGMM/FV1NXXYJR4TEGMM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA3/K90A/JR4TEGMH/FA3K90AJR4TEGMH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNB/RZOW/JR4TEGMN/FNBRZOWJR4TEGMN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKJ/4P3O/JR4TEH93/FKJ4P3OJR4TEH93.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Detailed Sketch"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Booyah! Time for the cut!\nFirstly, cut out the easier part. Don\u2019t ask me why \u2013 because I don\u2019t know (it might make you feel more confident to do the rest or something) Make sure you stick to the lines. I will give you a tip. This is a tip for getting out of a maze, but it works with cutting too. Before you start cutting run your finger from the start of the design, along each line and make sure you can go around the WHOLE design and back to the start without taking your finger off the page. If you can you are ready to cut. OK, here goes, don\u2019t cut yourself.\nDone?\nAwesome!\nNow start the harder part (if you have two parts in you design). Use the same trick that use used before and then cut out the design.\nNow you have finished cutting you can stand back and admire.

Now turn the screen over so you are looking at the INSIDE of the screen and cover the screen where it meets the wood with tape. If you miss this step, paint will get under the screen and is hard to get out.\nNow collect 3 plain white A4 papers (you can use Printing paper or Cartridge paper). Number them 1, 2 and 3. These will be used as trials so if you have made a mistake in your design you will can pick it up on the paper not the computer case.

(only if you do It right)\nLay out your trial paper one on you butches\u2019 paper. Place your screen on the Trial paper and line it up. Make sure your screen is up the right way and the OUTSIDE is touching the trial paper and the INSIDE is facing you. Add paint in a line onto the screen above you design. Make sure the paint is applied evenly and reaches both far sides of your design. Now grab your Squeegee and place about 1cm above paint. Hold the Squeegee on a 45-degree angle. When I get to this stage, I am all excited and my heart goes fluttery. Press the squeegee firmly against the screen. You assistant will be needed now to hold the screen down firmly as you perform the next part. Now pull the Squeegee towards you with about the same force as you would use opening a heavy door. Make sure paint has covered the WHOLE design.\nNow, here comes the REALLY COOL part. Get your assistant to start lifting the screen. The paper should go with it so don\u2019t stress if it does. Now peel the paper off the screen. I hope that it worked for you and you came out with a perfect print and you can experience the same joy that I experience when I get a good print.\nNow repeat the whole process 2 more times on your other trial papers. If there are small smudges in the painting like I have in the pic, don\u2019t panic. This can be easily fixed. Just turn over the screen and look for places where the paper has creased. Then press them down and the paint won\u2019t be able to seep into it again!\nNOW\u2026 ARE YOU READY???\nTime for the cool part. (which is kinda scary at the same time)\nTime to do what you did on the paper, just on the laptop case.\nDADADADOOOOOM\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nSo, lay out you laptop case and repeat what you did with your trial papers.\nOnce you have put a strip of paint on, ask your assistant to push the screen down harder than usual. Don\u2019t ask me why but for some reason it helps. As you pull you will notice that you use more force than usual. That OK. I do that too and it still works!\nNow. Wring your hands, take deep breaths, try control your heart beat and wipe the sweat off your forehead. ITS TIME for the SCARY part.\nJUST HOPE LIKE CRAZZZZZY THIS WORKED!!!!!\nNow peel the screen off the laptop case with as much care as possible (try do it nice and slowly so that you build up the suspense, its great but it nearly kills you!)\nNow admire your work.\nNow leave it to dry overnight and DON\u2019T TOUCH IT until you KNOW its dry!\nNow the question is, has it smudged. This happened on mine as you can see, and this is when the earbuds and the tissues come in handy. If it is a smudge in an open space, wet a small part of the tissue and run the paint off (while it is still wet). If you have the same problem as me and you smudge is in a tight space and if you use tissue you will do more smudges, Use an earbud. Just wet one end and then wipe off the paint.\nNow you can show off your awesome laptop case.\n#allyours #personalizedawesomeness #jealousfriends", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOK/VGZ0/JR4TEHP2/FOKVGZ0JR4TEHP2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZD/6G7K/JR4TEHP3/FZD6G7KJR4TEHP3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6I/IKQ1/JR4TEHP4/F6IIKQ1JR4TEHP4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXE/31OU/JR4TEHQ7/FXE31OUJR4TEHQ7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSG/LU2J/JR4TEHQ8/FSGLU2JJR4TEHQ8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA4/GNKG/JR4TEHQC/FA4GNKGJR4TEHQC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR5/ILZQ/JR4TEHQ9/FR5ILZQJR4TEHQ9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYX/U7QO/JR4TEHQB/FYXU7QOJR4TEHQB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMF/PKSB/JR4TEHQD/FMFPKSBJR4TEHQD.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: The Print"}], "channel": "Print Making"}, {"category": "Craft", "description": "Material\nWhite cement,towel , Acrylic colors,acrylic lacquer, weather coat distemper , beige premier , dry leaves, PVA glue,sand paper, blue small stone ,crystal ice stone.\nI tried to make cement decoration bowl ,you may made the vase using same method .Thanks for watching , if you like the video please press thumbs up button .Feel free to ask any question or suggestion in comment box & subscribe my channel .", "title": "DIy Cement Decoration Bowl", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/DIy-Cement-Decoration-Bowl/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Take any big pot & cover with cling film.Now take white cement ,make the smooth mixture .Take square piece of towel ,dip in mixture & place it on the pot like i did .Leave it about 24 hours for drying .Take out the cemented pot , rub it with sand paper & hobby knife clear the edges .

Here\u2019s how to make a felt cover to pretty up a cafetiere and keep the coffee hot for a second cup. It\u2019s a suitable beginner\u2019s needle felting project. Not only that, it's a good use for a sweater that has reached the end of its life. But if you don't have such a garment, you could make this from a piece of thick industrial felt instead.\nYou'll need:\nan old sweater in a plain colour (100% wool, not superwash treated)\nscraps of coloured craft felt\na felting needle\na foam block or upturned brush for needle-felting onto\npaper and pencil to make a pattern\na tape measure\n3 sew-on press studs or a short length of Velcro (hook and loop closure)\nsewing thread and needle\nscissors\na sewing machine (not essential)", "title": "Felt Cosy for a Cafetiere / French Press", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Felt-Cosy-for-a-Cafetiere-French-Press/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Perhaps you have a wool jumper that someone (let's not dwell on who that was) has washed on the wrong cycle and it's now too small. Or maybe the moths have got to a sleeve, or an elbow has worn through. As long is the back or front, at least, is largely hole-free, it should be suitable for felting. (Strictly speaking, as we're starting with fabric and not fibre, it's milling not felting, but never mind that.) It needs to be a plain colour because you are going to embellish it.\nChop off the sleeves and the collar if there is one, and cut down the side seams. Then throw the back or front in the washing machine the next time you have some laundry to wash on a normal wash, not the gentle wash you would normally use for wool. You could felt the other pieces too if you wish and use them to make things such as an e-reader case.\nI find that little and often is best for felting, so I'd recommend using a wash cycle at say 40\u00b0C (100\u00b0F) that's suitable for coloured synthetics rather than a white cotton wash at a higher temperature. You will probably have to subject the garment piece to several washes to get the right degree of felting, but better that than putting it in a single hot, vigorous wash and finding that it's become so stiff and shrunken that it's unusable.\nAfter each wash, flatten the piece with your hands and leave it to dry naturally until you next use the washing machine. If it develops creases, iron them flat with a steam iron before you wash the piece again or the creases will become permanent.\nWhen the jumper back or front has been adequately felted it should be only about half the size it was, but nice and thick. Also, it won't unravel when you cut it. Make sure you stop washing it while it's still big enough to wrap round your cafetiere. Let it dry and then press it with a steam iron and leave it somewhere warm to dry thoroughly.\nThe piece I used for this cosy was the front of an old cardigan - note the buttonholes that you can see along the bottom of the picture and the cabling which runs parallel to the buttonhole edge, a few inches above it.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3I/8U9V/JQUU67PM/F3I8U9VJQUU67PM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Felt Your Sweater"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Start by measuring the circumference and height of the cafetiere.

You\u2019ll need a rectangle of felt that is about 0.5-1\u2033 (1-2.5cm) shorter in each direction, plus an extra piece for the closure flap.\nCut a paper pattern of the maximum size you think you need and check it fits neatly around the cafetiere. The two ends won\u2019t meet because the handle is in the way, they need to stop just short of the handle. Trim the pattern until it fits well - I ended up with a 11.5\u2033 x 5\u2033 / 29cm x 13cm rectangle.\nCut out a little V where the cafetiere\u2019s pouring lip is, to make it less likely that the felt cosy will get drips of coffee on it. When you are satisfied that the pattern is the right size and shape, pin it to the felt and cut around it, avoiding any holes. If there are any interesting features of your felt, like the cabling on my cardigan front, you could make use of them - I cut my cosy such that the cabling formed the lower edge of it.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7U/DZ3B/JQWT0C3B/F7UDZ3BJQWT0C3B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEB/H8OY/JQWT0C30/FEBH8OYJQWT0C30.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Measuring and Cutting"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "All you need for the embellishment is some thin craft felt of the type that is sold in small squares for children to use. Cut out one or two large shapes (eg coffee cups, a Scottie dog, holly leaves, whatever takes your fancy) or lots of small shapes in different colours. I wanted to complement my favourite spotty coffee mug, so I cut out circles in five colours.\nIf this is your first go at needle felting, practise first with scraps of the backing felt and embellishment felt. Place the backing felt on the foam block with the coloured felt on top, hold it in place with your finger (or the tip of a pin) and stab the felting needle repeatedly into it. There are two important things to remember:\nKeep the felting needle well away from your fingers, it is VERY sharp.\nHold the needle upright, perpendicular to the surface of the felt, or it will break. While any part of it is in contact with the felt, it must only move in an up and down direction.\nMove the felting needle around (in between the stabbing actions) until the whole surface of the embellishment felt has been well and truly covered.\nIf you turn the backing felt over, you should see a coloured shape on the other side, indicating that fibres have been taken right through the fabric, like in the photo.\nKeep going until it is no longer obvious that one piece of felt has been appliqued onto another and it looks more like the backing felt has been painted or printed with a different colour, but stop before any holes form in the embellishment felt.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQS/SAFE/JQUU6AXS/FQSSAFEJQUU6AXS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIY/SEHM/JQUU6ATU/FIYSEHMJQUU6ATU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKP/Z8RR/JQUU6AW9/FKPZ8RRJQUU6AW9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYF/2LYM/JQUU6AX9/FYF2LYMJQUU6AX9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Preparing to Embellish"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "When you feel you have had enough practice, arrange your felt shapes on the backing fabric in a pleasing way.

I found that about 80 stabs were needed to tack on each of my coloured circles. Remove any pins from a shape before you begin needle felting it, although you can hold a pin in your other hand and use its tip to stop the shape moving around if needed to start with.\nNext, you must go back over each appliqued shape and needle felt it more thoroughly. A multi-needle felting tool makes the job faster, but I was able to do each of my 1cm circles in 3-4 minutes using a single needle. Go round the edges particularly thoroughly so that they are no longer proud of the surface and the felt shape appears to be part of the main fabric. In the first photo of the yellow circle it is not yet completely felted onto the backing fabric, while in the second one it has been fully attached.\nWhen all the circles are fully felted onto the backing fabric, give it a good press with an iron and lots of steam (or a damp cloth) to get rid of all the little stab holes.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFS/OA6Z/JQUU641K/FFSOA6ZJQUU641K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0B/K5DV/JQUU6BB3/F0BK5DVJQUU6BB3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBR/118C/JQUU63YR/FBR118CJQUU63YR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO2/5W0A/JQUU63XB/FO25W0AJQUU63XB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Adding the Embellishment"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "From the remains of the felted jumper, cut a rectangle that will fit through the cafetiere\u2019s handle and overlap by about 1\u2033 (2.5cm) on either side of the cosy.

Cut out the wings with a one cm or half inch allowance for the next step (it doesn't need to be exact).\nOnce you have each wing cut out, fold it along its front edge, but don't put a hard crease in it so that the airfoil shape can be made (unless your wing is supposed to have a sharp edge).\nHint: for cereal box cardboard, place the edge on a slightly rounded corner and rub the fold into the cardboard with a pencil or similar hard object.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FV1/7YLG/JQWSYVWZ/FV17YLGJQWSYVWZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8E/6YNC/JQWT0607/F8E6YNCJQWT0607.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJK/SEAU/JQWT060J/FJKSEAUJQWT060J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYY/84T7/JQWSYVWJ/FYY84T7JQWSYVWJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Constructing the Wing Base/outer Shell"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "After the base for the wing has been made, it is time to work on the inside of the wing, which will help the wing keep its shape, and help prevent the wings from bending too much if you ever feel like throwing this plane.\nFirst, grab some of the thicker cardboard and measure out enough quadrilaterals to build the wing up to the right height. This step doesn't need to be as precise since no one will actually see the insides of the wings. For my plane I used three pieces stacked on top of each other, each losing about a centimeter in length and width for each level.\nAfter you get your pieces cut out, glue them to the inside of the wing as close to the front edge as possible.\nOnce the insides of the first wing are in place, fold the wing in half over top the inner supports. Glue the insides of the wing together, placing glue on the top of the supports to make sure the wings are strong.

Break up the pulp with your fingers and then dump it in a plastic strainer. Push as much water out as you can and then put the pulp in the big bucket. Do this for each roll of toilet paper.\n2.

I did this the night before Christmas Eve and my blanket split in half!! I didn't get to give my friends their blanket until New Years Eve! (I know it sucked!) So trust me when I say leave more time for finishing and for checking!\nI like to wash my blankets (depending on what the yarn wrapper says you can do) before I give them away. It insures that the blanket is clean (duh) and that if any threads will come loose, you will be able to spot them first and hide anything away. This is up to you. It's not necessary. I would push for it, if you are giving the blankets to babies or little kids. It lets the parents know that it's safe to wash and whatnot. Whatever you choose to do when giving away the blanket also give away one (or more depending on the different brands of yarn you used) of the yarn wrappers. This lets the recipient know how to wash according to the yarns preferences. I always make a note out of it and circle the wash instructions for the recipient.\nAnd that's it! Enjoy!

I found a book (Mini Weapons Of Mass Destruction, AMAZING books on little projects 100% recommend) that showed someone hollowing out the inside of a book and hiding stuff in there, I immediately grabbed the biggest book I could find and started cutting out the inside of the pages. 10 minutes and 20 pages later I realized that this was gonna take a lot longer then I had expected, so I abandoned the book and continued to search for a new idea. That's when I stumbled upon a guy who had hollowed out a deck of cards, I found the nearest deck of cards and started cutting. 1 hour and a deck of cards later I was holding a hollowed out deck of cards. That idea has stuck with me and when I saw the Safe And Secure contest this memory came back and I decided to make an instructable on it.

The first solution, instead of glueing half of the top card down and bending it up you could leave the top card un-glued and just hold it down with the rubber band, thus removing the bend mark. The second solution, you could have the bottom of the deck open up so that the bend mark will be on the bottom instead of the top. The third solution, split the deck in the middle and drill two small holes in the corner and fit a small dowel in them so that the deck opens from the middle instead of the top or bottom, giving it a more natural look.

The crazy thing is that the sock has disappeared altogether even though your soothing shuffle was contained to a 10-foot space.

Either by design, to make you buy more socks, or maybe it's science \u2014 a combination of the physics of the smoothness of baby skin, gravity, and constant movement.\nAnd if you thought losing thousands of socks throughout a baby's tenure was bad enough, another issue is having baby pants ride up exposing the bare skin between the top of the socks and the bottom of the pants.

You'll need a lot of these. What I did was I would cut a pile, use them up, and make another batch. (Image 10)\nWhen you have some shingles, spread glue at the base of one of the flat structures. Lay shingles on the glue, overlapping the curved ends of the sticks so that the shingles appear to be the bottom of the edge of the roof. The shingles look quite good when there is a small space between them, and if the ends do not perfectly math up it makes the roof look very quaint, as well. (Images 11 and 12)\nStart another row of shingles overlapping the first row. Make sure you have a half-shingle at the end so that the shingles are spaced evenly. (Image 13)\nWork your way all the way up the roof and repeat the entire process. I ended each half of the roof with nine rows of shingles. (Image 14)\nFlip the roof halves upside-down. Spread glue on the end of the roof and place one of the triangular sections on the glue (Image 15) Make sure that the right side is facing outward. Spread glue on the other end of the roof section and place the other triangle down. Place glue on both ends of the second rectangular roof section and carefully set it where it should go on the two triangular end pieces.

Cut four pieces this long and glue them on each side of the window on both windows. (Image 5) Cut four more pieces that are longer than the width of the window plus the two trim pieces. Cut the ends of the trim so that they are angles slightly. Glue them on the top and bottom of the window as shown in image 6. Repeat for the other window.\nUsing the same technique except with no lower piece, trim out the doorway.\nCut a piece of stick exactly as wide as the door gap and glue it down. You will need to shave some off this piece with your craft knife since it would stick out past the door without being trimmed. Make sure the cut edge is straight. Glue this piece level with the floor. (Image 7)\nLast of all on the door you will need to cut another piece the same width as the door opening.

Using the craft knife, slice a stick down the middle, creating a thinner piece of wood. Cut three angled pieces to make an \"X\" shape for the front of the door. Take your time to make it all fit together well. Cut the solid piece first and glue it in and do the smaller half pieces after that.

(Image 6) You can trim off any excess glue, but it's not necessary since it won't be seen.\nNow, carefully spread glue on the inside of the house on the wall immediately beside the doorway. Be careful with the hot glue because this is awkward to try to do. The picture was awkward to take too--apologies! Press the free half of the ribbon down in the glue. Make sure the door is able to freely open and close before the glue is dried, and slide the ribbon in the glue as needed to adjust it accordingly. If you mess up, that's okay. Just cut off the glue and ribbon and try again. This won't be seen, so no need if it's ugly! (Image 7)\nUse hot glue to make four circles of glue. Do this by holding the glue gun straight upright and letting the glue form circular blobs. Try to make them uniform. After they dry, cut the circles out and glue one on the underside of each corner.

(Image 2) Set aside to dry.\nUse brown paint and carefully cover the overlapping sticks that make up the siding. Be careful not to get any paint on the trim-work. I left that plain because the creamy wood contrasted nicely with the brown. (Image 3) Use the largest brush to do larger surfaces, and the small one for getting right up beside the trim. The fine brush is perfect for doing the small areas like the tops of the ends of the roof piece and on each side of the door and inside the door. Your finished walls should look like image 4.\nPaint the chimney gray. (Image 5)\nPaint the shingles dark gray. Leave the ridge plain for the contrast unless you don't want to. Since the shingle have lots of little cracks, I gave it two coats of regular paint. Then I gave it one last coat using watered-down paint that was able to run down into the cracks, so I would suggest doing that.

You can also use whatever size yarn you'd like, but as the yarn's diameter gets larger (more chunky) you'll want to go up a size for your crochet hook. A good way to figure out the hook size you'll need is by looking at the yarn label. Somewhere on it, it should give you a recommended hook size. If the hook size is close to the size I used in the pattern I highly recommend just using the same size hook I used.\n*I tend to use a smaller hook size to keep my stitches looking more full without having to worry about the tension in the yarn.

It doesn't matter the brand, but as I haven't used any of the others, I can't say which brand I'd prefer.\nFirst, since this is a tree, I wanted it to have a green tint to it. Paint the entire tree with green ink using the paintbrush. Be sure to do a VERY thin coat- not too much ink or it will be too thick to react well with the other colors and alcohol.\nAlcohol ink dries very quickly so after a few seconds, it should be relatively dry. However, alcohol will activate the ink again. (Try saying THAT three times fast!)

It doesn't matter where, but do not overdo it- remember, less is more! Also, be sure the drops of ink are light and thin- too much and it will run everywhere and take over your tree!\nAs soon as the drops hit the metal, they will immediately push away the green ink away from them.\nAfter you add the red, add a few drops of alcohol as well to the green to create different shades of green.\nAt this point, you do not have to follow these steps exactly. Get creative, and make your tree your own. I was experimenting too, and each time I painted a tree-half, I did it a different way. However, I found that by following the steps listed here I had the best results.\nAlso, when using the inks, they come in dropper form so that you can drop the ink directly onto your piece.

Just a drop here and there gives it a magical, sparkling look!\nOnce all the colors are added, you can either choose to mist the ink with the alcohol mister or use a small paintbrush and add drops of alcohol directly to the metal. In the pictures above, I have shown both techniques. Since I was experimenting, I did a little of both, but after comparing the two, I decided I liked the effect of dropping the alcohol much better than misting it.\nOnce you have painted all 5 trees, front AND back, wait until they are dry to begin gluing.

I'm planning for my own right now and I'm trying to keep it simple (haha), but I can't resist making as much of my accessories / decor (and the website, and the invitations, and, well, all the paper goods) as I can. When it comes to my veil, there is no exception.\nThe style for our wedding is shaping up to be something that I've been calling \"Future Minimal\". The color pallet is pretty much black, white, metallic silver, and hints of clear. I have had the plan to make edge-lit acrylic table numbers for the wedding since at least the beginning of our engagement (might put those up in another post - stay tuned!). I attended an LED class at my local Makerspace to learn more about how I could best make 12-20 edge lit signs for the wedding. At that class, I got to check out EL wire, which I had seen used in costumes, but had forgotten about. After that class, I had the bright (See what i did there?) idea to try to make a glowing veil using the EL wire.\nI googled around and watched a few traditional veil DIYs to see what shapes are commonly used - sky is the limit it turns out. I decided to go with a half-oval for mine. I still may add another tier or blusher (that's the part that goes over your face). I also found out about EL tape while I was shopping for the wire, so I am thinking I will make a headband out of that for the reception.\nLet's get making!", "title": "EL Wire Bridal Veil", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/EL-Wire-Bridal-Veil/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Tools:\nSewing machine\nHand sewing needle\nIron\nIroning board\nFabric marker\nRuler / measuring tape\nFabric glue\nMaterials:\nA light, shear fabric or netting of your choice.

Many people suggest a press cloth for organza, but I assume they are referring to silk organza. I believe my organza was synthetic, because ironing it on the silk setting with no press cloth and no water in the iron worked best for me. Your mileage may vary.\nI used a cloth measuring tape to see how far I wanted the veil to drop from where I wanted to wear it on my head. I settled on 22 inches. Then I tried to measure a length that could wrap around my shoulders if I wanted to wear the veil that way. This came to 38 inches, but I rounded up to 40 inches. I added 1/2 inch of seam allowance to each side of the width, and to the bottom of the length, and then rough cut the resulting 41\" x 22.5\" rectangle. With the rectangle folded over, I used my fabric marker to sketch out a curve. I tried to make it end about tangential to the bottom and sides of the rectangle.\nI ironed my half-oval to get the fold line out. Then I began to iron a 1/4 inch seam allowance all along the curved edge of the veil. After that step, I notched the curved edge. Notching helps remove fabric when the seam allowance is longer than the seam. Typically you would notch after sewing, but my plan was to fold the fabric twice to make a casing (I just had to look up that term) along the edge of the fabric so that the raw edge would end up inside the casing. This would hold my EL wire and look neat and tidy. After notching, I ironed the second 1/4\" seam allowance with the raw edge folded under.\nSince I wanted to sew just along the edge of the casing, I opted to use my blind hem foot. A blind hem foot has a little guide for the edge of your fabric to ride along, so your needle comes down right by the edge. I adjusted the guide until I was happy with the placement of the stitches. Then I sewed along the curved part of the veil very slowly, folding the next bit down before sewing it. I did this slow approach rather than using pins because I do not have any smaller pins that would have been best for this delicate fabric. I did not backstitch at either end to lock the stitches - you do not want to do that with a fine, shear fabric. Instead I pulled the bobbin thread to the front at each end and tied the top and bobbin threads together. I ironed the sewn piece once more.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F4L/KR67/JQKTMT7T/F4LKR67JQKTMT7T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF5/G4RJ/JQKTMTGO/FF5G4RJJQKTMTGO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0Z/4J5M/JQKTMU76/F0Z4J5MJQKTMU76.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPD/NCCP/JQKTMU9H/FPDNCCPJQKTMU9H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS3/M5OM/JQKTMUES/FS3M5OMJQKTMUES.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIG/XXLD/JQKTN0F8/FIGXXLDJQKTN0F8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEK/XTKJ/JQKTMUZH/FEKXTKJJQKTMUZH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGR/2Q6J/JQKTMUYQ/FGR2Q6JJQKTMUYQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWZ/3T41/JQKTMVDM/FWZ3T41JQKTMVDM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPS/RD3D/JQKTMVS0/FPSRD3DJQKTMVS0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVW/NCHK/JQKTMVSZ/FVWNCHKJQKTMVSZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG2/XHQ3/JQKTZ6OP/FG2XHQ3JQKTZ6OP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE8/KFRN/JQKTZ39Q/FE8KFRNJQKTZ39Q.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Making the Basic Veil"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "At this point, I put the EL wire in and held the veil like I would wear it to check it out.

The burr was easily removed with a hobby knife, but that's something you might want to check for before you start threading the wire through your veil.\nTo gather the veil, I simply hand stitched along the straight edge of the veil, and then pulled the thread like a drawstring until the veil gathered to the length of my side comb.\nI watched a few DIYs on attaching the side comb and was glad I did! I would have attempted to whip-stitch the veil to the comb, but I learned a neat method that I think worked better. I took a long scrap of my organza and tied it to the comb as shown.

In order to figure out your gauge, knit a small amount of the colorwork in the pattern and then measure how many stitches per inch you are getting. This is called a swatch. If you are getting too many stitches per inch, then change to larger needles and measure again, if too few stitches per inch, then change to smaller needles. Knitting at the same gauge as the pattern will make sure that your mittens come out to same size as those in the pattern.\nI don't like to swatch, so I usually just begin with the needle size recommended in the pattern and hope for the best. Once I have a bit of the colorwork done, then I measure my gauge. If it is close enough, then I've already got some of my mitten done and can continue. If it's too far off, then I consider what I've knitted so far to be a swatch and try again on different sized needles. The gauge for the mini mittens is 8 stitches and 8.5 rounds per inch. If you wanted them even smaller, you would knit so that you had more stitches per inch. My large size, to fit a medium-sized adult hand, has a gauge of 4 stitches and 4.75 rounds per inch.

This is normal. Try not to pull your stitches too tight, because this can cause the fabric to pucker. If there are more than 5 consecutive stitches of a single color, then it's a good idea to twist the two yarn strands around each other so that there's not a really long float on the inside of the mitten that can get caught on your fingers. Try not to twist the yarns in the same place on adjacent rounds, because this can cause little dots of one color to show up in sections that should be solidly in the opposite color. You can tell where you twisted it on a previous round by looking between the stitches. If you twisted the yarn between those stitches on the previous round, you will be able to see both yarn colors between the stitches. If you didn't twist it there, then you should only be able to see the one color that you had used to knit the next stitch.\nHere is a video showing how to twist the yarns.

Start with the bird.\n2. Gently insert it into the ornament. Let it drop to the bottom and then slowly pull it up until it hangs where you like it.\n3. Hold the excess filament down on the outside neck of the ornament.\n4. Put some hypo-cement on top of the filament around the lip of the ornament and down along the outer side of the neck. Only far enough that it will be hidden by the cap.\n5. Hold until set enough. May take a minute, but it will set enough to move on to the next piece.\n6. Snip off the excess filament.\n7. Repeat steps 1 through 6 with the four butterflies.\n8. Put a fresh layer of hypo-cement around the outer side of the neck and place on the cap.\n9. It takes about 24 hours for the hypo-cement to harden. Once it hardens, the ornament is ready to hang.\n10. Clean off the outside of the ornament to remove all the smudges. Polish with a clean piece of cotton.\n\nNotes: Be patient with this part. It takes a little time to get all the origami pieces hanging nicely. Use a long pin to untangle the pieces when they are on the inside. Allow for variation. Just let them hang as organically as possible.\n\nAfter I have inserted 2 pieces of origami into the ornament I look down inside and find the largest gap between the threads and aim my next piece through there. I let each piece drop to the bottom and then slowly raise them up into the desired position. This helps in preventing tangles.\n\nLastly, when placeing the cap I aim the clip to insert between as many filaments as I can. This will minimize the interference the clip can have on how the origami hangs. It is also part of the reason that I shorten the clip.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6T/2TFI/JQKTXA91/F6T2TFIJQKTXA91.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP7/LELY/JQKTXA41/FP7LELYJQKTXA41.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZH/RAKM/JQKTXA5V/FZHRAKMJQKTXA5V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZZ/TG49/JQKTXABP/FZZTG49JQKTXABP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYZ/X9FN/JQKTXAEG/FYZX9FNJQKTXAEG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7W/IWA3/JQKTXAH9/F7WIWA3JQKTXAH9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7R/MA62/JQKTXVFI/F7RMA62JQKTXVFI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXP/U0JF/JQKTXVKH/FXPU0JFJQKTXVKH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F54/B3ZR/JQKTXVPH/F54B3ZRJQKTXVPH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGY/1B9Y/JQKTXVUI/FGY1B9YJQKTXVUI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB8/SM37/JQKTXW3C/FB8SM37JQKTXW3C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0Y/K5V1/JQKTXW7S/F0YK5V1JQKTXW7S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF5/CPMK/JQKTXWCY/FF5CPMKJQKTXWCY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH7/A22J/JQKTXWI3/FH7A22JJQKTXWI3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAZ/4NW2/JQKTXWVD/FAZ4NW2JQKTXWVD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMK/FHUJ/JQKTXWY9/FMKFHUJJQKTXWY9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1U/XTZB/JQKTXX2U/F1UXTZBJQKTXX2U.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Assemble the Ornament"}], "channel": "Paper"}, {"category": "Craft", "description": "As I have stated in past Instructables, Photography can be an expensive hobby but it doesn't HAVE to be.

The animation centres around an Edwardian dolls' house. This contains original mainly Arts and Crafts fixtures, fittings and furniture and dolls and toys from the Victorian era and up to the 1920s. In order to supply the narrative, I am adding characters and at the moment I am using needle felting to do this. I have already made a collie cross dog, who is to be one of the major characters and his stunt double who is also the director of the film. This dog replaces the one I remember being in the dolls' house in my childhood but which over the years has 'gone walkabout'.\nThe new Teddy bear is for the doll we have identified as being manufactured by Fran\u00e7ois Gauthier (later Gaultier) and from the mark as being made between 1887 and 1900.", "title": "Teeny Tiny Teddy Bear for a Dolls' House Doll", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Teeny-Tiny-Teddy-Bear-for-a-Dolls-House-Doll/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The technique used in needle felting is to get the wool, which is naturally barbed to pull itself together into a shape or flatten itself out with the motion of the needle thus by felting (or in the vernacular, stabbing in and out of) the wool. It is actually very much like using the pressure of your fingers to shape clay. Leaving an unfelted fringe-type end to a shape allows you to join elements of your design together, such as the head to a body but in this case I am going to 'joint' my bear by running a thread through the main elements, i.e., the body, head, arms and legs.\nFor the Teddy Bear I've decided to use the 'knot and wrap' method to make solid shapes for the body and head. I am then going on to make some simple individual, folded and/or rolled needle-felted shapes to construct the arms, legs and ears. This is a technique I learned from watching a needle felting professional. If you are new to needle felting, as indeed am I, then I suggest at some point you head over to the YouTube channel of Serafina Fiber Art and take a look at her tutorial 'Bunny Puff', which is a great starting point and one of her signature designs. This is the first project I tried out when I started to learn the craft/process and I liked her work because she uses the wool much as a sculpture artist uses clay. Above you can see the starting point of my bunny project: the 'knot', then the head and body wrapped and joined and the final outcome. For the bunny I used Organic Merino Top, White Jacob Sheep Top and a bag of Scoured Mixed Jacob Fleece Wool, which I sourced from Cumbria in the UK. Jacob Fleece is a great way to get some nuanced shades of natural wool.\nFor the above design, I used as directed, core wool, which as the name suggests is for building the interior 'skeleton' or 'carpentry' of a character or for wrapping armature, such as in the Dogs (above bottom right). However, as the Teddy is such a tiny character it needs very small amounts of wool to be easily broken off the main piece, such as in fine wool roving. I'm using what is often referred to as Fairy or Magic wool. This is organic plant-dyed wool in suitable wispy bits of carded wool that are easy to pull off in very small amounts and often used for making fairies and small dolls. I have only two colours of this which I bought in a sale years ago and have been languishing at the bottom of my wardrobe. One is a deep Burgundy red and I have used a little for the interior of my dog's mouth and the other is an eminently suitable fawn for the Teddy. As you can see from the above, I also used a little of the fawn in the Puff Bunny.\n\nTo make this project I'm using a fine, 36 gauge triangular needle felting needle held by hand but many people prefer to use a pen style needle felting tool\n\nI am also using a home-made mat from double thickness jute sacking and filled with organic rice. You can buy these but they are really fun to make. The mat is needed for two reasons one to support the work and the other to stop you from breaking needles. When the work is felted on the mat it will start to adhere to it but you can gently prise it away. When you are needle felting you should keep lifting the wool from the mat to stop it from getting embedded too far as this could damage the work when you lift it off, in particular with a tiny object like this.\n\nN.B. I needle felt very slowly and carefully particularly on a tiny subject like this but if you are in any way worried about hurting your fingers then you should either invest in or make some leather finger and thumb protectors.\n\nOne extra item you will probably also need is a magnifying glass on a stand.

Needle felt (lightly jab) all over the egg shape to firm up the body. If you are worried use a pair of tweezers to hold the work.\nHEAD - Take a length of roving or fairy wool half the size of the amount you took for the body and repeat as for the body\nEARS - Pull off two short \u00bd\" or 1cm length fine sections of wool and then gripping each end firmly pull it apart and restack it several times so that you have a flattish, even square piece to work on with the fibres in the same direction. Repeat this so that you have the two ears ready to work on at the same time. Stab a vertical line with your needle all the way down the ear and then stab a small ear shape, leaving enough wool at the bottom unfelted, this will allow us to attach the ear. Then start rolling the wool inwards around the ear shape and felting with the needle to create a hollow in the middle where you can add a little contrasting wool. I just rolled a tiny amount of darker Jacob wool in my finger tips and then felted it in.\nFACE - When you use the fine needle over and over in the same place it will pull in and afix a round ball of wool to make a very handsome eye. The more you felt the smaller the eye will become, so this is a great technique for getting the eye to the exact size. Roll a piece of dark wool into a ball and then do as above. On a larger subject you can also add highlights and/or coloured irises in the same way. Similarly for the nose. Again if it is too thick use the fine needle stabbing technique to make it thinner.\nLEGS & ARMS - These are made from short sections of wool, \u00bd\" or 1cm lengths but unlike the ears take treble the thickness. As with the ears, grip both ends and pull out the fibres and restack them so they are all going in the same direction. Then stab a vertical line down the middle of the piece and at right angles to the fibres, after which you should roll up each end to create the paw and shoulder/top of leg. Then roll in the wool from one side into the centre line to make a cylindrical shape and needle felt lightly to hold together. Gently lift the piece off the mat and then roll in the wool from the other side. For the arms flatten the paw end and add a touch of darker wool. Do the same with the bottom of the feet.

I think the light-tree would look better with a larger base, perhaps 2 \u00bd to 3 ft diameter.\nI considered cutting the circle with a jigsaw, but ended using my table saw, to get a round circle easily.\nI clamped a board with a hole in it to my table saw, as a pivot. I adjusted the position of the hole in the board so that its center was one foot from the saw blade and aligned with the center of the blade. Then I clamped it in place.\nI drilled a hole in the center of the 2 x 2 piece, set it on top of the clamped piece, and stuck a post through both holes. This allowed me to rotate the 2 x 2 past the saw blade, cutting a circle. I lowered the saw blade and I did a shallow cut part-way through the 1/2\" thickness. Then I raised the saw blade and circled around again for the full depth cut. The goal was to reduce the blade scraping on the wood as I rotated the piece. Even so, this was not a pretty process, creating much smoke and burned edges on the piece from unwanted friction. I am sure you can find a better way of making the circular piece.\nI had located the center of the 2 x 2 the usual way, drawing lines diagonally from opposite corners, and drilling where they crossed.\nI similarly located the 8 notches around the piece. First drawing a line across the piece through the center hole, by eye. (This might be better done before the hole is drilled, but it was accurate enough for this project.) I next drew a line perpendicular to the first. That located 4 notches. For the other 4, I measured between two adjacent lines at the edge, and marked the \u00bd way point. I repeated that on the opposite side. And then drew a line through the marked points and the center of the hole, edge to edge. I repeated that on the perpendicular, and that gave 8 edge locations. I estimated the diameter of the light string cord, and drilled 8 holes to form the base of the notches. I then just sawed each notch to the hole.\nI took the pieces that were cut off when turning the 2 x 2 into a circular piece, trimmed off the points, and screwed all 4 under the plywood as feet. This lifted the base, which allowed me to string the cords, and hide the plugs under the plywood base. It worked fine on my carpet, but if you are doing this on a wood floor, you probably need thicker feet than the \u00bd thick ones I used.\nI screwed a scrap of plywood under the center hole, to form a bottom stop for the post.\nFinally, I painted the top side and edges, of the base white.

We pulled just enough tension as we went so that the pipe stayed vertical. It is important to string both sides of the tree at the same time, as the pipe, plywood and plastic top are not strong enough to support the strain of being pulled from only one side.\nWe started \u00bd way around from each other, bottom to top, then to the adjacent notch, top to bottom. Details of the way the light strings fit into the notches are in the photos.\nThe light strings each had some left over, which we just stuffed under the base. This step took less than 15 minutes. After the light strings had settled for some hours and relaxed to their final length, we went around the light-tree again making small tension adjustments to back to vertical. Mostly just pulling a bit at the bottom of a run, and folding the cord under the base.\nSince the strings we used each had an outlet at the far end, we were able to plug the head of one string into the tail of the other.

And pretty easy to turn into ornaments. I also thought the shiny polished Aluminum would have a nice retro mercury-glass look...which it did, kinda sorta, and they looked awesome on the Christmas tree.\n'Japanese polished Aluminum foil balls' have been popping up all over the place out there - these balls are made from nothing more than a roll of tin foil, balled up and compacted by hammering, then sanded and polished to a beautiful shine. That, and many hours of love. There are plenty of videos on YouTube showing the process of making polished Aluminum balls, also credit to this Instructable: https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Pol... which got me started on the process of making the ornaments.\nAs I was researching, I didn't find all answers to my questions out there on the interwebs, so hopefully mine will answer some additional questions for others in the community (like size of finished balls, techniques for minimizing creases, etc.)\nSo my first question was: How much foil will I need to make an ornament ball, say, 3 inches in diameter?\nI couldn't seem to find an answer, and everyone was using different foils of different sizes and thicknesses, so I just bought a roll of Reynolds Wrap (200 Sq ft size, or 66.67 yards x 12\"), fairly commonly available across the US, and used the whole roll of foil to find out for myself. The resulting ball was way too big for a tree ornament, about 5.5\" diameter and heavy (850g/1lb 14 oz!). So I decided to go for half the roll of foil for each of the ornament balls. These turned out to be just over 3.5\" diameter...still slightly larger than I'd wanted but good enough as I didn't want to make any more at this point!\nThey were not too heavy (at ~14oz, still the heaviest ornaments on the tree), so did need to be hung on lower branches of the tree. Slightly smaller balls would have been ideal (my suggestion for others is to use a roll of the Reynolds 75 sq ft foil per ball, which should be perfect).\nThe larger ball didn't go to waste btw - it was turned into a giant ornament and hung in the dining room window, using 20lb fishing line.\nSupplies Needed\nAluminum Foil (I used this Reynolds Wrap: https://tinyurl.com/y8uoeerc)\nSandpaper (multiple grits, about 120 to 3000 grit. I got these: https://tinyurl.com/y6w3pmw9)\nAluminum polish (https://tinyurl.com/ya7ozdpx)\nCloths for polishing (I used cut up old white T shirts)\nEye hooks (I used 1 3/16\" 210 hooks: https://tinyurl.com/yct8w7y8)\nEnd caps from cigar tubes\nFishing line (12lb or higher)", "title": "Polished Aluminum Bauble Ornaments From Tin Foil", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Polished-Aluminum-Bauble-Ornaments-From-Tin-Foil/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "So I already knew that one whole roll of Reynolds Wrap would result in a way-too-large bauble. How much to use then? I went for easy and made two balls from the single roll. Instead of measuring by length, I went by weight...weighed the whole roll, then aimed for half that amount as I was balling up the first one, weighing it until it reached what I was looking for. They ended up being roughly the same weight (within 25g of each other) which worked out great. The weight of the cardboard inner tube I felt was negligible so hadn't worried about it.\nFrom making the first (giant) ball, I knew that I had an issue to solve - a flap created as I finished balling up the foil ball. The flap wouldn't go away, and interfered with sanding and polishing. After all that hammering, it was an unsightly and jagged sharp edge - not good. I hadn't paid any attention to it at the time, but knew I didn't want a repeat with these ones.\nMy solution seemed to work well: the ball is formed by rolling and balling the roll of foil. Turning as you go, the ball gets bigger and bigger. As you get to the end, roll the last few turns on the straight and crimp the ends together- meaning that you finish with a crumpled 'ear' on each side, sticking out from the ball.\nThe next step involves a whole lot of gently hammering the ball all over, continually compacting it in on itself with each hammer blow as it slowly shrinks in size. So - before getting into it, hammer in the two 'ears' so that there is actually an indentation in the ball where the ears were. Use a small diameter hammer and get the ears pushed in as deep as you can get them. Now as you hammer around the whole ball, slowly compacting it, the indentation where the 'ears' were will slowly be closed in on itself as the ball shrinks in size.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRD/HMS6/JQGYKD7M/FRDHMS6JQGYKD7M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOP/SLUS/JQ6YGYKJ/FOPSLUSJQ6YGYKJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1J/1TZE/JQ6YGYK6/F1J1TZEJQ6YGYK6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4F/DJMW/JQ6YGYKW/F4FDJMWJQ6YGYKW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI6/VGQ4/JQ6YGYL9/FI6VGQ4JQ6YGYL9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCM/QSW0/JQ6YGYLA/FCMQSW0JQ6YGYLA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD1/PU1R/JQ6YGYJY/FD1PU1RJQ6YGYJY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ4/JTF3/JQ6YGYLN/FJ4JTF3JQ6YGYLN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Start Balling Your Tin Foil"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I found that firm, but gentle, hammer blows worked best, holding the ball in one hand and tapping away with the hammer in the other.

Better to just hold it in your hand)\nThe texture changes as you work on it - starting out every hammer tap visibly dents the ball, but towards the end there is less denting and it begins to sound like a metal ball.

Mine is 30\".\nFold the ribbon in half to find center and place the center over the loops you created, this will become your bow tails.\nPinch the ribbon at the back and twist it, tie with twine.\nYou now have completed your bow and you can flatten or mold the loops as desired to get the fullness you want for your wreath.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9A/4QGH/JQGYE8HX/F9A4QGHJQGYE8HX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRD/KXH1/JQGYE8NY/FRDKXH1JQGYE8NY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8I/P0DI/JQGYE8T5/F8IP0DIJQGYE8T5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F80/EO2I/JQGYE8TG/F80EO2IJQGYE8TG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4E/55CX/JQGYE8ZR/F4E55CXJQGYE8ZR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ2/HD1R/JQGYE94Z/FZ2HD1RJQGYE94Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQC/TR3K/JQGYE9A8/FQCTR3KJQGYE9A8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY1/UHO3/JQGYE9A9/FY1UHO3JQGYE9A9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVU/LXGS/JQGYE9AC/FVULXGSJQGYE9AC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY6/IUBV/JQGYE9AD/FY6IUBVJQGYE9AD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE5/22NN/JQGYE9B2/FE522NNJQGYE9B2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5H/RQTM/JQGYE9G9/F5HRQTMJQGYE9G9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ7/Z879/JQGYE9QK/FZ7Z879JQGYE9QK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBK/ZBQF/JQGYE9VQ/FBKZBQFJQGYE9VQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX2/PPOR/JQGYE9VR/FX2PPORJQGYE9VR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVK/F4V8/JQGYEA4O/FVKF4V8JQGYEA4O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVS/VIXN/JQGYEAAZ/FVSVIXNJQGYEAAZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7D/I759/JQGYEAB0/F7DI759JQGYEAB0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTS/NCBV/JQGYEALE/FTSNCBVJQGYEALE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSM/FX25/JQGYEALI/FSMFX25JQGYEALI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSJ/P78I/JQGYEAMP/FSJP78IJQGYEAMP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIY/87TC/JQGYEASZ/FIY87TCJQGYEASZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZN/47JX/JQGYEAT2/FZN47JXJQGYEAT2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY3/SN2A/JQGYEAY8/FY3SN2AJQGYEAY8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Making a Bow"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "The final step is adding your bow to the wreath.

I went to the theater with my cousin and watched it on opening night fully decked out in my Ravenclaw outfit and my Fantastic beasts book copy in hand. At 11.45 when the movie was finished we had to spend a good 30 minutes just discussing the events of the movie with various gleeful squeals, and when I got home, I accidentally spent 2 more hours reading the Fantastic Beasts book over and over and already longing for the sequel.\nI loved most things about the movie, but being a sucker for props I was instantly drawn to Newt's suitcase in the \"muggle mode\".

It becomes more realistic when the crumbs look like real debris breaking off the building. Real sets sometimes get destroyed too so hope you capture what you need on the first go. Film in normal real time and use your movie editor to slow down or speed up the footage.

So it was a case of mixing and matching and adding supports where necessary to get something to print. I also printed out the terrain base as well using a random terrain generator. With the terrain, I drew in a grid of holes so that I could plant trees knowing that ground scatter would be used to cover up the holes not needed. This let me place the trees so get a pleasing effect.\nThe trees here are a cheap N scale pack of firs normally used for model railways, as are all the bushes and ground covering.\nThe AT-AT was particularly hard to print, and after several failures where the printer head would knock it over I came up with an idea to let it cool and harden a bit more on each layer. I did this by printing 3 AT-AT's spaced widely on the print bed. This meant that as the printer moved from the 1st to go and print the next it would give it a longer time to cool and it seemed to work out and I was able to print them more reliably.\nFiles Used:\nBasic AT-AT (x-Wing) ver 0.44 http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2175958\nEndor Landing Pad - ATAT Docks https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2797170\nLambda Class Shuttle at Legion Scale https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2810881\nStar Wars Legion Terrain: Endor Landing Pad Scene https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2888019", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F04/Y9GN/JQ6YIERA/F04Y9GNJQ6YIERA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3N/87DD/JQ6YIDTF/F3N87DDJQ6YIDTF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOF/OB05/JQ6YIEQ2/FOFOB05JQ6YIEQ2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3T/28ZF/JQ6YIESY/F3T28ZFJQ6YIESY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F86/TTO9/JQ6YIESZ/F86TTO9JQ6YIESZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYL/3C9W/JQ6YIESE/FYL3C9WJQ6YIESE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9I/KZVL/JQ6YIERU/F9IKZVLJQ6YIERU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Endor Landing Pad"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "One of the things you then find out pretty quickly is that inside fake binoculars there is no light.

I could also play with the colour and eventually have settled on a colour shift that gives either a purple for a nice night time look, a green for the trad style night vision googles and also a red, because it look good.\nI made a base out of some plasti-kard and built a little stand for the neopixel and an enclosure for the battery. Driving the neopixel is a 5v trinket with a rudimentary sketch.\nI also wanted a small battery to power this and I had some small drone batteries around, but they are 3.8v, so I used a pololu step-up/down 5v board. These are great little boards, https://www.proto-pic.co.uk/pololu-5v-step-upstep-... and I came up with the idea here to solder one directly to a female JST. You need to wire in the ground lead at the same time as this is shared with the 5V out, but it really gives a compact little unit delivering a nice 5v. It has a quiescent current of around 0.1mA so it would eventually run the battery down, but it can be easily be unplugged between missions.

And the basics of how simple circuits work.\nThe first thing to try because it is easiest to fix is to put the battery in facing the other direction. LED\u2019s only allow electricity to flow (and light them up) in one direction.\nYour circuit as an electrical diagram should look like the picture above\nThe plus negative symbol at the top is the battery, the rectangle on the right is the resistor and the triangle line with arrows pointing out on the bottom is the LED.\nThe straight lines are wire, in real life they go everywhere and are not at all straight.\nThe important things to note on this diagram is that the wire and components together make a circle (or rectangle) so that the electricity travels through every component (not around any) and back to the start to complete the circle.\nIf the wire before a component touches the wire after that component the electricity will not travel through that component and the LED will not light up.\nThis can happen if you do not cut the wire between step 5 and 6. Or if the felt between the LED legs does not separate them well enough, or the stitching comes through and extra layer of felt.\nTo fix this, cut unneeded wires that skip across components or put extra felt (or some paper) between wires that touch when they shouldn\u2019t.\nIf the wires do not make a complete circle back to the other side of the battery the electricity will not be able to travel in the circuit at all and the LED will not light up.\nTo fix this use wire to connect the gap. This may mean joining a point that was missed or cut earlier, or you may have to put extra wire between the battery and the wire on the felt to make sure they touch.\nWhat if your light is flashing or lights up sometimes and turns off other times by itself?\nThat means that you have one of the above two problems, but only some of the time.

I used a piece of the scrap for a final bottom 5th layer. It's worthwhile talking to staff, they know which woods are more durable and easier to work with, and if they warp with temperature etc.\nOne thing to consider as well is how many layers you will have, and how thick this is going to make the finished product.

The first time I used a whole bunch of pigments, but I couldn't seem to hit the right gradient based on my tests prior even though I was writing down the combos.\nThe second time I used just two colours, a whole lot of cyan, and then I added black as I went through each layer, which simplified things ridiculously. In order to nail the colour gradient, I recommend using a gradient generator such as ColorHexa.com.

Keep the short end straight and bend it away for now, we\u2019ll use this part for creating the bail later.\nThe long end of the wire needs some kinking and bending to get the fuzzy and messy look of a birdsnest. The easiest way I found is by wrapping your wire round a pencil tightly, except for the last 20cm or so. Then hold the pencil (on the egg-side) and simply pull the wire off the pencil!

I simply loop and pinch, trying to cover the bottom as much as possible. As you can see in the pictures, it\u2019s quite springy and wants to spring away from the pendant. This is why every 5 loops or so, you need to weave a wire through a already secured part of the nest, onto the new springy loop you just created. You don\u2019t have to loop through the middle part of your nest anymore (although you can), you can use the side-wires for securing newly looped wire onto!\nThe bottom of the nest wasn\u2019t covered nearly enough after 5 loops, so I kinked up some more wire and started to make more loops around the bottom. Notice that on the second loop I added my small bird-pendant to the wire. I made sure it was opposite side of the wire that will be turned into my bail later.\nAfter securing the loops where my bird-pendant is on I moved to the top of the nest. It was looking to flat and the small pearls were actually still sticking above the wires when looking from the side. With these loops you have to make sure there not passing over the pearls. Keep them in line with the rest of the nest.

The size of the bricks depends on your box, but the ratio of standard bricks is 3:1 in length;height. In total, I made 188 bricks to cover my entire fireplace. Make sure to cut a few long bricks to make the end pieces for the corners. In real life, this would just mean that 2 of the 4 sides of the cuboid would be exposed. We have to fake this with a wraparound piece of brick.\nCutting all of the bricks out doesn't actually take long, but after that, we're moving on to painting, which is usually a tedious and messy process. HOWEVER, I have a trick to share with you!\nGet yourself a piece of reject cardboard, and some masking tape. Tear off strips roughly the width of the reject cardboard, but place the strips on it with the sticky side UPWARDS. You just fasten the very ends with a tiny piece of tape placed the right way around. Make rows and rows of sticky tape, and then place all of your cut out bricks face up on the tape. This just holds the brick in place in one place. Normally when painting something like this, we'd hold the bricks one by one in our hands, but this gets messy real quick. By fastening the bricks we have a way to paint without the mess (all the excess ends up on the piece of cardboard), and the bricks stay in place unlike if we had just placed them on a surface without the tape.

Now, dab the bricks for a natural, uneven look. If unsatisfied with the unevenness, just add more paint after the first layer has dried.

I made four pieces to end up with two stockings. I firstly went all around the shape (except the foot hole) with a blanket stitch (here's my favorite blanket stitch tutorial) in a matching color thread, but a contrasting color would probably look great too. A tip if you're struggling to make evenly spaced stitches while hand sewing is to scribble two lines on the side of your thumb to represent the width you want between each stitch. That way, you always have a reference right up against your fabric to guide you.\nFor the white rim, I cut a piece of felt twice the length of my foot opening width, and twice the height I wanted my rim to have. The reason for doubling the height is because I know that my felt is a bit sheer when layered over bright colors, so I wanted to double the fabric for maximum opacity. Fold the height in half, and sew down the sides and folded edge with a blanket stitch. Leave the long side with the fold opening unsewn. Use some decorative scissors to cut along the unsewn long side, right by the edge. Felt doesn't fray, so you don't have to zigzag around aaaaalll those little decorative elements if you don't want to. Just leave them be with the sides holding the piece together. Sew the long strip into a loop, ending up with a loop with seams on the sides and top, with a nice intricate edge at the bottom. Pull the white loop in place over the red sock, and stitch along the top. Make sure to stitch each side seperate, you don't want to sew your foot opening closed!!\nThe stitches around the toe and heel are purely for aesthetic reasons, but I think it adds to the overall look. When starting the stitches, enter the needle from the inside of the stocking to avoid having a knot sticking out in the front. Again, make sure to sew each side separate so you don't sew the sides together.\nCut out letters if you wish. I cut out a P for my younger brother's name in green felt, and a C for his dog's name. I then cut slightly smaller versions in white and layered on top. sew this onto the side of the stocking.\nFor the hanger, you simply need a narrow strip of green felt, folded in half and sewn to make a loop.

You can you any sturdy hard surface, e.g. vises often have a small flat surface for hammering. My intention was to make the ring have this wave shape. I noticed that the ring will \"automatically\" start to bend in this way if you are not careful and make sure you hammer it straight and don't hit too hard.\nAfter a while of hammering you will notice that the ring edge of the ring will slowly get wider. You need to hammer the ring as long as needed to get the edge to wanted wideness. You also should make sure you don't only hammer on one spot but keep turning the ring around to keep it round othevise you will end up with falt areas on your ring.\nAt some point of the hammering I thought I want to still make the ring a little wider but as I had already started to bend the ring it started to bend slightly too much. I straightened the ring a little in the vise and kept on hammering until I was satisfied with the wideness.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9A/9BV7/JPX4T519/F9A9BV7JPX4T519.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIM/5AQV/JPX4T51A/FIM5AQVJPX4T51A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ1/GXJ6/JPX4T51B/FQ1GXJ6JPX4T51B.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Shaping the Ring With Hammer"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I didn't have any good way to hold the ring while drilling.

This was enough to keep it on it's place until the hole was done.\nAfter drilling the hole I put the coin in to a vise being careful not to tighten it so much that the coin starts to bend. I used a dremel with carbide bit to carve the hole near to wanted size. At his point I thought I still wanted to make the hole larger but I didn't want to remove much more material so I took a round steel bar and used that as an anvil as a hammered the ring a little more. Once again it is important to constantly turn the ring around and not hit too hard to avoid flat spots.

I had an issue understanding how to cast on the stitches, in order to knit with my arms. And, I also have a problem with pain in my shoulder, so that method was out of the question. This method that I will share with you is called hand-knitting and it can be done on a flat surface, the floor or table. Another issue I had when I first started research on making a chunky blanket, was the cost of the yarn. Many people make theirs out of some type of chunky wool, which is beautiful - but it ends up costing at least a hundred dollars for the yarn, if not more. This blanket that I made only cost $18!\nIf you're stopping by, I just want to say thank you! I haven't posted on here in a very long time and for that I am sorry. I miss Instructables immensely.

You will put your finger underneath that bump and reach for the working yarn, pulling it through and creating a loop. Try to make the loop lay flat and continue on with the rest of them, until you reach the end. You will see that the bottom of the piece is braided when you create it this way.

If you are on a brand new row, skip the first stitch and begin working in the 2nd loop. By doing this, you will be creating a beautiful braided affect along the edges.\nFor each stitch, you just put your hand through a loop, grab the working yarn and pull it into the loop to create another loop. These loops can be quite loose or tight. It is up to you. I made mine a bit loose, and this created a blanket a bit larger than the standard measurement of 30 x 50 inches. I only used 3 skeins of yarn to make it. I recommend trying to keep the loops on the side, tighter rather than looser. Otherwise the braided edges will look a bit sloppy or possibly a little too loose.\nKeep working row by row until you have the desired length. It takes very little time to create this blanket.

You will use at least 3 skeins of yarn, and will need to attach new yarn to the piece as you go along. For me personally, I did a lot of research and tried to learn from some experts in this field. I found two recommended methods.\nThe way I attached a new piece, was very simple. When I got close to running out of yarn, I pulled out a new ball of yarn and took the end of it to the end of the working piece I was running out of. I then tied those two together into a very basic knot - kind of like tying your shoes, but into a knot. I tightened it as much as possible, then trimmed the ends off. With using chenille yarn, this is very unnoticeable when all is finished.\nIf you want to be extra careful, you could then take out a needle and thread (of similar color to your yarn) and create several stitches through that very knot. If I were to make these blankets to sell them, I would most definitely do that. I would never want it to accidentally come apart, especially if someone purchased it or I gave it as a gift. If that happens to you and you made your own blanket without the thread reinforcement, you should just be able to use some excess yarn (as long as it wasn't super tightly knitted) and re-knot it where the knot came out. It should be totally fine.\nThe second method is not the one I used. This method involves beginning a new row with your new yarn, and weaving the ends of your old yarn into the back side of the piece.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8G/QFA3/JPSO5DDO/F8GQFA3JPSO5DDO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4O/YE1Y/JPSO5DDP/F4OYE1YJPSO5DDP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Tips on Joining New Yarn"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Finishing off the blanket is easier than you might think! Take two loops into your hand, then take the working yarn and pull it through those loops, creating another loop. Now take that new loop into your hand and grab the loop next to it so you have two loops again. Then pull the working yarn through those loops to create another loop. Keep doing this until you reach the end. Then, you will pull the final piece of yarn through the final loop, creating a small, unnoticeable knot. Then, take the end of the yarn and trim it so it is a bit shorter and tie a knot at the end. Then, weave this through the back of the fabric to blend it into the rest of the piece. You could also, optionally, take that needle and thread out and sew it inconspicuously to the blanket you made. But, that is not necessary.

At some point I caught a TV special about the making of Empire Strikes Back that showed some footage of the ILM model shop. It briefly showed a spaceship model being made from scratch and my young mind was blown.\n\nMore than 30 years later I finally decided to try my hand at building a model from scratch. I have taken a somewhat hybrid approach, using a variety of techniques: styrene scratchbuilding, kit-bashing, vacuum forming, machining, and 3D printing. I will describe these techniques individually and show how these been used historically and how I\u2019m using them in my project. This will not be so much a step-by-step guide as a general overview using my model as an example. I hope that you find this interesting and might even be inspired to try some of these techniques yourself", "title": "Sci-Fi Spaceship Model Making", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Sci-Fi-Spaceship-Model-Making/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The material that I will be working with is Hi-Impact Polystyrene (HIPS) (here after called \u2018styrene\u2019). It is the standard material for injection molded model kits. It is available in smooth and textured sheets of various thicknesses and as rods, tubes, domes, and strips at your local hobby shop, from Evergreen & Plastruct. From here out, I will refer to these styrene shapes simply as 'Evergreen'.\n\nSheet styrene is MUCH cheaper when purchase in large sheets from a local plastic supplier than buying it from a hobby shop in small pieces. I got mine online from McMaster-Carr. A 12\" x 24\" piece of .030\" thick was about $2.40. You might do even better buying a full 4' x 8' sheet from a local supplier.\n\nStyrene is easy to fabricate using only hand tools and can be painted to represent a variety of materials.\n\nGluing is generally done with a solvent which works by dissolving the plastic locally and fusing the pieces together. I prefer Tamiya brand cement which comes in both standard (orange label) and Extra Thin (green label). They both have a built in brush in the cap and are quite easy to work with. The standard orange label one is thicker and has more working time to align your parts. The Extra thin is my favorite. Just line your parts up and run the brush along the joint. Capillary action wicks the solvent into the groove and the parts are joined. Easy. Avoid old-fashioned Testors cement in the tube. Strictly for squares.\n\nFor tools, a ruler and and a hobby knife will get you 90% of the way there. Another great tool to have is a plastic scriber. Olfa and Tamiya both make great ones. They excel at making straight cuts. A few passes across the plastic (using a metal ruler to guide the cut) is all that's needed. Then just bend the plastic along the scribe and it will break cleanly along the score. This is much faster than cutting all the way through.\n\nSmall holes can be drilled or made with punches. For cutting larger holes in sheet styrene, I've had good luck using an Olfa circle cutter. Again, it is not necessary to cut all the way through, as the plastic will separate along the score with a little flexing.\nA handy tool for cutting Evergreen is something called the Chopper. It's essentially a single edged razor blade attached to a pivoting arm, like a paper cutter. There is an adjustable stop which is invaluable making multiple cuts of the same length. Of course, me being a cheapskate, I made my own.\n\nFor sanding, I make my own sanding sticks by bonding sandpaper with double-sided tape to paint stirrers and Popsicle sticks. Wooden coffee stirrers can be used if you need to get into really tight spaces. 220 and 340 grit paper are good general use and are usually as coarse as I need to go, with styrene being quite soft. 400 and 600 wet and dry grits are handy to remove scratches.\nA helpful jig that I made to glue sides square is simply two pieces of scrap wood glued 90\u02da to each other. I then faced each piece with sheet steel, so I could hold pieces in place with magnets while the glue dries. Care must be taken not to let the glue wick between the plastic and steel as this will melt the plastic to the steel and mar the finish.\n3D printer filament is also available in styrene (known as HIPS). It has similar printing properties to ABS. I\u2019ve found that it sands beautifully and glues readily with the Tamiya cements. While you can\u2019t print with the kind of detail you need for scale models, it excels for printing larger shapes that you couldn\u2019t make in other ways. These printed parts can then have further detail added through the addition of model parts or Evergreen shapes.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCX/RLSV/JPN3NT9L/FCXRLSVJPN3NT9L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHG/FVWX/JPN3NT8W/FHGFVWXJPN3NT8W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN0/S1RG/JPN3NT9J/FN0S1RGJPN3NT9J.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Basic Tools, Materials & Techniques"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The choice of subject of course comes down to personal taste. I wasn\u2019t interested in recreating a screen accurate model of a movie subject due the tons of reference material needed. On the other hand, I didn\u2019t feel I was ready to go completely freestyle, grab some plastic and just start improvising.\n\nWhat ended up working for me was to find a rough concept sketch that I found interesting and use my imagination to interpret the lines on the page. The sketch I chose was from the blog of artist Rob Turpin, It\u2019s a very unusual design that I was immediately drawn to. It has a quality that reminds me of the work of M\u0153bius (Jean Giraud). Plus, it looked really difficult to make. I likes a challenge, me!\n\nWhen making something as complex as this, it's easy to become overwhelmed. I found it helpful to approach it as being an assemblage of simpler shapes and to consider each one separately. Each one becomes a puzzle that needs solving as you plan your approach. I decided to start at the left and work right, like reading a book, tackling each part separately.\n\nI knew the bubble shaped canopy would probably be limited to a found object, rather than something I could make, and because of this, this part would drive the size of the entire model.\nI found that acrylic test tubes were available cheaply in a variety of sizes. I chose a 40mm test tube and the whole model was scaled to fit this one part, making the finished model a total 12 inches long (300mm). This worked out to be around 1:87 or HO scale.\n\nI imported a jpeg of Rob\u2019s sketch into a CAD program and scaled it until the canopy was the size of my plastic test tube. This gave me a reference that I could draw on top, design parts, and take dimensions from. This CAD file was the backbone of the whole project. I also printed out the sketch full size so I had a paper guide that was 1:1 with the physical model. This was handy to have on my bench as I worked.\n\nThe clear plastic of the test tube was quite brittle and prone to cracking (like a clear CD case). I made a simple fixture out of a piece of scrap plastic that clamped on the tube and gave me a surface to guide a fine hobby saw against. The tube had an artifact from manufacturing at the very end that was both inside and out. I tried with partial success to polish this out.\n\nThe ribbed section that surrounds the bubble was turned on a lathe from a 2\u201d piece of solid styrene rod that I bought from McMaster-Carr. I also made a fluted styrene ring added to the bottom to add more detail. These were glued together and a section was cut out to fit a piece from an airplane kit. The inside was sanded to match the contour of the test tube and the gap was sculpted in with Aves epoxy putty.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6Q/FUSR/JPN3NTA7/F6QFUSRJPN3NTA7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPS/5K5S/JPN3NTAD/FPS5K5SJPN3NTAD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU8/LQVM/JPN3NTA9/FU8LQVMJPN3NTA9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCC/TPAD/JPN3NTAC/FCCTPADJPN3NTAC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7B/9ZOS/JPN3NTA8/F7B9ZOSJPN3NTA8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Subject Matter and Beginnings"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The next section to consider was the hull. I decided to make the front portion as one vacuum formed piece, because of the large radiused corners.\n\nVacuum forming is a manufacturing process where by a thin sheet plastic is held in a frame and heated until soft and then stretched over a positive form. The plastic is pulled tightly around the form using vacuum and allowed to cool until hard again.\n\nStyrene is an excellent candidate for vacuum forming. It can be softened at a relatively low temp (385F) and holds detail well. Vacuum forming is an easy way to make parts that would be very difficult to make in other ways. The resulting parts are light weight and relatively strong.\nThe vacuum former that I used is homemade, but great results are possible using a home oven and shop vac. For example\u2026\nhttps://www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-good%252c...\n\nI fashioned the positive form for the hull out of a high density foam using a band saw and a belt sander. I tapered the sides about 5\u02da to aid removal from the plastic. The form was sprayed with primer and wet sanded with 600 grit sand paper to get a nice smooth finish. Having any surface texture will make it harder to separate the plastic from the form later.\n\nThe finished form was placed on the vacuum stage and dusted with baby powder to help keep the plastic from sticking. I loaded some .060\u201d thick styrene into the frame and heated it until it drooped about the same amount as the form was high. At that point the frame was brought down, stretching the plastic over the form. Then the vacuum was turned on, causing the plastic to suck tightly around the form. Once cool, the plastic was removed from the form and trimmed into shape. Remember that the final part will be thinner than the starting material thickness because you are stretching it over the form. In my case, the finished hull was less than half the starting thickness.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F69/CTOW/JPN3NTAY/F69CTOWJPN3NTAY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3P/3X0T/JPN3NTAZ/F3P3X0TJPN3NTAZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV2/HK9L/JPN3NTB2/FV2HK9LJPN3NTB2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Vacuum Forming"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Next a box was built out of sheet styrene to fill in the rear of the hull. The sides were cut from .030\u201d sheet using the scribe and score technique. The plastic scriber is guided along a metal ruler a few passes which scores a line in the plastic. The plastic is then bent along the scribed line which snaps cleanly. A few passes with sand paper and it\u2019s ready to go. It\u2019s often easier to cut a side a little big, glue it in place and then sand the overlapped edge flush.\nSome styrene sheet was glued into the inside the vac form to further strengthen things. I also glued some Evergreen strips to register the styrene box when it's inserted in the vac-formed hull. Some textured sheet (also Evergreen) was added to the box along the sides and bottom to add some interest.\nThe convoluted middle section was turned on the lathe from the same 2\" rod that I used earlier. This had a 1/2\" hole drilled to receive the armature rod.\nI then began to add some styrene shapes that would form the support structure of all the engine details. These were a combination of sheet construction and machined shapes. I decided things would be more interesting if I varied the surface a bit more, so I made two square cutouts on the back of the box. Into these I fit two small styrene boxes and sanded them flush. 1/8\" Evergreen rods were bent using a heat gun to form pipes. These were routed into the two square cutouts.\n\nAn important thing to consider from the beginning is having some kind of an armature or support structure in your model to hang parts on and as means of supporting the model for display (or filming). Most movie models have a number of places where some detail can be removed and a rod can be inserted to support the model during photography. In my case I decided to use a 1/2 inch aluminum rod down the centerline of the model. This would help keep all the circular parts concentric when I glued them together. It was also very helpful as a way to support the parts during construction and later when painting.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FP0/YHLL/JPN3NTDV/FP0YHLLJPN3NTDV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXG/DV3R/JPN3NTDX/FXGDV3RJPN3NTDX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHO/AZ3L/JPN3NTDM/FHOAZ3LJPN3NTDM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F86/3JD9/JPN3NTDP/F863JD9JPN3NTDP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHD/ZL3C/JPN3NTDQ/FHDZL3CJPN3NTDQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZY/RJ53/JPN3NTDL/FZYRJ53JPN3NTDL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGL/7ZS9/JPN3NTDZ/FGL7ZS9JPN3NTDZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1J/MVEN/JPN3NTDS/F1JMVENJPN3NTDS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Building the Rear Hull"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "To detail the rear engine portion of the hull I turned to a technique called kit-bashing.\nKit-bashing is the process of using commercial model kit parts to add detail to a model. This is usually done in a way that obscures the origins of the original part. Bits of military armor and aircraft kits are arranged in a manor to give the impression of functional mechanical detail and to catch the light as the model moves across the screen, creating moving shadows across the surface which increases visual interest. This technique has been used since the early 60\u2019s on the Gerry Anderson TV shows like Thunderbirds, but probably reached its zenith with the original Star Wars trilogy.\n\nMilitary armor kits were often used, but so were racing cars, airplanes and ships. By choosing kits of different scales, a variety of detail levels can be achieved. The model makers at ILM called these surface details \u2018greeblies\u2019 or \u2018greebles\u2019 .\n\nAccruing a good selection of model kits to raid for parts can be difficult because kits are expensive and you often don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting for parts until you get it home. One thing that can help is a number of websites have photos of the parts \u2018trees\u2019 so you can peruse the kit before you buy it.\n\nOnce you have some kits, it\u2019s important to stop thinking of them as kits. They are now raw materials. I often take them out their boxes and collect them in totes. I also store parts that have been separated from their trees into bins that are easy to sort through when detailing, grouping like parts together.\n\nIf you carefully study the screen-used sci fi models from the 70\u2019s & 80\u2019s, you notice that these kit parts often do not evenly cover the entire surface of a model, but tend to be clustered together in groups. Often, they are filling trenches or recessed areas. Locally, things are arranged so that they seem to connect and have some sort of function, even if somewhat abstractly. Groups of parts can be connected with ducts or piping made from Evergreen bits.\n\nAfter adding some kit detail to the engine area, I also added some further detail to the front vacuum form. I cut a rectangular hole on either side and built a shallow plastic tray under each. This tray was also filled with an arrangement of parts, because I thought this would look better than simply sticking them on top. I also cut some panels from .030 sheet and glued them in place. Among these, I fit some hatches and armor plates from a couple of 1:72 scale tank kits, figuring the scale was close enough.\n\nAt this point things look a bit disjointed because of the different colors of the kit parts.

After reading that styrene printer filament was available, I decided to try printing the parts. I bought a cheapo (sub-$200) printer kit, the Tevo Tarantula. Once it arrived, I made some improvements based on shortcomings I had read about while researching the printer. Most of the improvements consisted of stiffening the frame and replacing the laser cut acrylic parts with machined aluminum ones. I also upgraded the hot end due to the higher temperatures needed for HIPS. I built a simple enclosure out of pink foam insulation to help keep the print from cooling too quickly and warping.\n\nThe rear segment was modeled in four pieces and featured a centrally located 1/2\" hole that would allow for the aluminum armature rod to run through them and to help with alignment when gluing them together. The parts printed quite nicely. Any layer lines were sanded off and voids were filled with auto body putty. The printed styrene parts were strong and very light weight.

They were then detailed with Evergreen bits.\n\nI thought it would be cool to be able to see a pilot and some cockpit detail though the bubble. I imagined the pilots seat and controls to be an open framework that used gyros to stay level while maneuvering. With this in mind, I built up a structure out of 1:72 tank parts and a bit of Evergreen. The frame was glued to a small piece of Evergreen tube that I mounted on a thin styrene disc. I founds some HO scale astronauts online that included a couple seated figures. One was chosen and fixed to the seat with some superglue.\n\nThe two antenna-like stalks on either side of the hull were made from kit parts and some Evergreen rod and tubes. The paddle shaped pieces at the end were cut from a couple of 1:35 scale helicopter blades.

At this point the model was still largely unassembled, with the model broken into its major sub-assemblies for easy handling during painting.\n\nMy wife is quite sensitive to solvent vapors, so I chose to use water based acrylic paints to finish the model. Vallejo brand acrylics are well thought of and available at my local hobby shop, so I decided to go with those. The plan was to lay down the base color in acrylic using an airbrush and then use oil paints over this to age the model.\n\nI bought a \"For Sale\" sign at the hardware store and cut it into 3x5 inch cards. Plastic signs are printed on...you guessed it, styrene. These cards were handy to have near by when I was painting, so I could check how the airbrush was spraying anytime I mixed new paint or varied the pressure. I could have used paper, but the paint would soak in a bit. The plastic sign was cheap and a perfect stand in.\nVallejo paints come in small dropper bottles. To make it easier to mix the paint, I added a stainless steel #10 nut to each bottle. Then I modified a small clamp to fit in my jigsaw. The bottom jaw of the clamp was built up with Aves epoxy putty, and used to take an impression of the paint bottle bottom. The top of the clamp was drilled out to receive the top of the bottle cap. Now the jigsaw could be used as an electric paint shaker.\n\nThe two colors for the base coat were orange and grey. I found a nice grey that I liked right out of the bottle, but no so for the orange. I would up mixing one from a couple different colors. Areas where the colors touched were carefully masked with tape. Once the model was base coated, I let it dry for a couple of days to let the paint fully cure. At point the paint job gave the model a very toy-like appearance. That's where weathering comes in.\n\nWeathering is the process of simulating the effect of age and the elements on the surface of your model. Things like rust, chipped and faded paint, and dust and grime can all be applied though some fairly simple techniques. For my purposes I'll be using artists oil paints. Oils are quite useful because they can be applied in very transparent layers (so effects can range from quite subtle to heavy handed.). For these I chose some inexpensive student grade paints and an odorless turpentine for thinning. A piece of corrugated cardboard makes a great palette, because it absorbs the linseed oil in the paint. With less linseed oil, the paint dries more quickly and with a matte finish.\nTo break up the monotone orange finish, I applied small dots of red, yellow, white and brown oils and blended them in with a touch of thinner.

It may seem too small, however the xtc-3d covers a lot of surface area with a small amount.

Snowflakes seemed like the obvious design to go with. After playing around with Isi8Bit's Minimal Waves design on Thingiverse, I knew I wanted to do more prints with different colored layers. This seemed like a great opportunity for that. The result is a simple but pretty earring design that can be printed as one piece but gives you white snowflakes and a silver border.\nYou can buy these earrings in my Etsy Store.\nSupplies for this are pretty basic. You need:\n3D Printer - I'm using a Prusa MK3\n2 Filaments: I'm using just White and Silver - you can just print this in one color, but two colors is more fun\n2 Earrings / pair of earrings you make (depending on your earrings, you might need jump rings)\nInstructable 292", "title": "Snowflake Earrings", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Snowflake-Earrings-1/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I knew I would want to sell these so I wasn't going to use anyone else's snowflake design. You can use mine, you can look online for someone else's you like or follow along to learn some basic steps for designing your own.\nI wanted to design a really basic 6 pointed snowflake design using Tinkercad that is made up of hexagons and rectangles.\nI started with a rectangle and got it the length and width I wanted it, then copied it and rotated the copies 60 and 120 degrees to get them spaced evenly.\nThen I wanted the points to be actually pointed so I used a rectangle and a hexagon to make a cutout.\nI added a hexagon to the center and then cut out the center of that to just get the outline.\nI wanted little arrow type shapes along the outside and figured I could make those out of hexagons.\ntext\nOnce I had the arrow shape I needed to get them all lined up the same on each point. To do this, I lined up one the way I wanted it, copied the shape. Looked at the ruler to see how far over on the X plane, rotated the whole thing, then moved the one over I copied so it was in the same spot.\nThen I repeated this (copy, rotate, move) until each point had one.\nI was going to finish at this point, but it felt like it needed a little something extra, so I ungrouped the snowflake so I could get the center 6 rectangles and copied them, shrank them down a bit, used a hexagon to cut out their center bits and was left with just the points coming out of the hexagon.\nMake sure everything is the same depth and\nDone.\nFor the first set of earrings, I decided to start with a cutout oval in the size I wanted the earring. Then I took my snowflake and shrank it to fit inside a couple times. I made sure they overlapped with the edge so they would print together. I knew I wanted to print this with different colors so I made the snowflakes not quite as thick as the border. I did some experimenting with the slicer until I had it the way I wanted it. I loop was added to the top for attaching to the earring. Once the design was completely done, I copied it and flipped it so the other earring would mirror it.\nFor my other pair of earrings, I decided to stretch and distort the snowflake to get it to fit inside an oval cutout. The first time I made these earrings I just squished the snowflake design so it fit, but decided later to edit the snowflake to make the lines more proportionate. I don't even remember how I did this, but in the end, I had a nice oblong snowflake that fit nicely in my shape.

This meant I needed 2 color changes. The first color change went after layer 1, and I checked the layers and decided the next color change needed to happen after layer 7 which was the last layer of the snowflake.\n(An easier way to do the earrings is to start with the snowflake color and then change to the border color when you get to the end of the print. I started with the border color because I wanted the back to not look the same as the snowflakes.)\n{REPLACE \"; layer 2, Z =\" \"M600\\n; Color Change, Z =\"}\n{REPLACE \"; layer 8, Z =\" \"M600\\n; Color Change, Z =\"}\nFor the test prints, I ran into some issues with the smaller snowflakes not filling in. One thing I usually do to fix this is increase the Outline Overlap to up to 35%.

Do you have a lot of old shirts laying around that aren\u2019t in use? Don\u2019t put them to waste, use them in your instructable! That was one of my main inspirations and goals for this project. Another problem that this can solve is finding a creative way to share your memories. I have been to graduation parties where people use just pictures, but those can get ruined very quickly. Putting shirts together will last forever. Along with putting them in frames they will be extra protected. I wanted to do this project because I want to show my memories of my hometown Westlake. I had a bunch of shirts and I wanted them to go towards good use and this was one of the ways I thought of.\nIn addition, to wanting to make this project I needed to know who I wanted to make it for. Who were going to be my major targets for creating this? After seeing older relatives graduate I decided to create something that someone who has accomplished a major spot in their life could cherish forever. I wanted to target graduations of people and major accomplishments. People all over the world should try this project. You can get so creative and just have a blast.

There were definitely a lot of ups and downs, good and bads to my instructable. One of the major challenges I had was gluing all the shirts. My initial thought was to crop shirts and glue them together. With the scrap pieces I practiced and it really was not working out. I wanted this to turn out well, so then I started thinking. My mom and I decided to put the shirts in a frame. We would glue them onto a piece of paper and then put them in a nice, neat, orderly frame.\nIn addition, to finding ways to problem solve I was taught a lot of new stuff. Working with the glue gun I learned it hardened very quick, so I had to glue down at a fast rate. This challenges was not major but it was a good learning point. I was new working with the iron board but soon enough I was able to get the hang of it while still keeping my safety in mind. Something that took time was figuring out how to place all of the shirts. They needed to be visible but, needed to correspond with the other materials. To conquer this problem I did a lot of moving and cutting so that all of the shirts would fit perfect. By doing this I also had to get creative by using smaller icons on the shirt. Like the small demons football was a perfect size and fit. All I had to do was get creative.\nMy mom helped me the most with the project. She was the one who took me to the store to purchase the materials I did not have at my house. She also taught be how to use the iron board correctly. At first I was ironing very slow, but my mom showed me how to do it efficient while still making the shirt look good. When I was working on it if I needed her to take a picture she would be more than happy. This was very helpful and I greatly appreciated it.\nIn conclusion, I strongly suggest that you try your own t-shirt memorabilia at home! It is a way to show your love for something in a new way.

You don't have to put a picture of a Demon on your pillow, but I chose to since it is my school mascot. I decided to do my school mascot because I am in 7th grade and this was my first time representing my school in sports. The image you put on the Demon Pillow could be a picture of a well known landmark, your family or pet, or even a selfie of you. The nice part about a pillow like the Demon Pillow is that you can make this pillow for a small amount of money, rather than going out and buying a designer pillow that could be over $100. The best part about the Demon Pillow is that you are the designer and can make it whatever you want!\nWith the Demon Pillow you are also able to make it any size you want and the image any color. My pillow is a 20 x 20 but you could make it anywhere from a 18 x 18 to a 24 x 24 and it would still look and be a normal size. It just depends on what size your couch or bed is. Another reason the Demon Pillow is nice is that you can make it your own. You could add more than one picture or you could do a patterned fabric or even iron on letters of a saying or just something that motivates you.\nAnother use of the Demon Pillow could be to give it as a gift to a friend or family member. If I made one for a family member or friend I would put a picture of myself and of that family member on the pillow. You could also iron on a saying that the family has or something that person always says. This is a nice gift to give because it shows that you took the time to capture a memory of you and that person in a creative way.", "title": "School Mascot Demon Throw Pillow - First Time Author", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/School-Mascot-Demon-Throw-Pillow-First-Time-Author/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Materials List\nThread\n20\" x 20\" Pillow Stuffing\n80 inches Fabric Material\n8 1/2 x11 Transfer Paper\nWax paper ( just to keep the surface clean)\nPersonally I chose to buy all of my products from local stores because it turned out to be easier for me to get my materials.

Before I started my project, I had to iron the fabric because it was so wrinkled. Now you are ready to cut your fabric. You also may want to use straight pins to secure the fabric while you cut it to the needed size.\nWhen I was cutting my fabric it helped me to have someone hold the fabric down while I was cutting the fabric to its exact size. Also, you may want to draw a line with a ruler or yardstick on where you are cutting because if you are like me, I do not cut very straight.

This 5 inch opening is where you will insert the stuffing for the pillow. If you are using a sewing machine I recommend using a simple stitch pattern if you are just learning. With a sewing needle you can do any type of sewing pattern as long as you think it is easy, durable, and looks nice.\nWhile sewing the pillow make sure to take your time. When I did mine I was making the machine go too fast while sewing and I had to use a seam ripper to undo some of my sewing. I had sewn too much of the fourth side of the pillow because I thought that I could fit the pillow insert into the pillow cover with only a few inches of the fabric unsewn, but I was wrong.

When you find a design you want to make sure that it is simple enough that you can cut the transfer paper relatively close to the image. I personally wanted to do an image related to Westlake so I decided to do our team logo the Demon. Once you figure out what image you are doing you need to insert the transfer paper into the printer. First, you need to take out your normal printer paper and put in a few sheets of the transfer paper. Make sure that the lines on the paper are going to be the back of the sheet when the image is printed onto the transfer paper. The side the image is on should be clear. If you are going to transfer words you want to make sure to \u201cmirror\u201d your image so the words are backwards. That way, when you iron on the words they are ironed on are the correct way.

Turn the image over so you see the back, which normally has lines on it. Using the iron, make sure to move in a circular motion on the transfer paper applying heat with force, for about 45 seconds. The amount of time you heat your image may differ depending on the size so I suggest practicing on a scrap piece of fabric like I did. You also want to make sure that you heat the sides of the image or words because if not the image will not fully transfer and the paper will stick out.\nAfter you are done applying heat wait about 5 seconds and then slowly pull off the transfer paper. When pulling off the paper move slowly so that you do not mess up the image that has been transferred to the pillow. After the image has been transferred and the paper is off, wait about 5 minutes to make sure that everything has cooled down and dried before you move the pillow or start sewing. After the image has transferred and cooled you can now put in the stuffing or pillow insert.

Along the way I learned that it would have been less time consuming to just use stuffing because I then ended up sewing a whole side of my pillow by hand since the pillow insert was so big. It took me about 30 minutes or more to sew the remaining side of the pillow because it was hard to do small stitches, but after a few breaks I finally finished sewing.

This consisted of an oval cylinder and a cylinder with a cone cutout for a rhinestone. I used an oval cylinder for the connector pieces because I didn't want those pieces to just be normal rectangles, I wanted to soften it up a bit and give it some more detail.\nIn order to get the dimensions about right, I started by bringing in a basic design of the molecule and then scaling it to the length and width I wanted. When I had that, I took my starting pieces and started putting it together. Above you can see how I worked to get the 3 piece intersections and 2 piece intersections to make sure the corners and joins all looked right. Once I finished a design, I constantly exported it and brought it into the slicer to find any errors. Then I went back to Tinkercad and made alterations and repeated the process until I had the final design I wanted.\nSince some of the molecules were similar, when I could, I worked with a finished design and altered it to make the new design such as Dopamine and Adrenaline.\nI ended up making:\nSerotonin - well-being and happiness\nDopamine - reward-motivated behavior (also sometimes considered the pleasure-seeking molecule)\nAdrenaline - causing increased heart rate, it is the molecule of energy\nCaffeine - is a psychoactive drug, known for causing awakeness\nGABA (gamma-Aminobutyric acid) - reduces excitability / anti-anxiety", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FC7/WH5X/JOWTI3AI/FC7WH5XJOWTI3AI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMA/RY7W/JOWTIQZI/FMARY7WJOWTIQZI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8M/P6Y9/JOWTI304/F8MP6Y9JOWTI304.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9X/KZJD/JOWTI3AJ/F9XKZJDJOWTI3AJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTU/RCA7/JOWTI34L/FTURCA7JOWTI34L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F63/5H03/JOWTI34M/F635H03JOWTI34M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ9/3TJX/JOWTI34N/FZ93TJXJOWTI34N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF3/5V35/JOWTI34O/FF35V35JOWTI34O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ2/TY4L/JOWTI34Y/FZ2TY4LJOWTI34Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLW/NHQU/JOWTI34Z/FLWNHQUJOWTI34Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ0/Q1KL/JOWTI350/FZ0Q1KLJOWTI350.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKI/AQ03/JOWTI351/FKIAQ03JOWTI351.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Designing the Molecules"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I didn't really do anything special for printing except for the 100% infill to make them as sturdy as possible.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6U/ONI3/JOWTI2FQ/F6UONI3JOWTI2FQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJE/WQ9I/JOWTI2FN/FJEWQ9IJOWTI2FN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Print!"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Start by gluing the rhinestones in their spots.

I made this to work with a Graflex Series B camera which at one point was one of the top-of-the-line cameras. It long ago belonged to my Great Great Uncle Nat who was a commercial photographer for JCPenney in the 1930s.\n\nMy reason for making this scan back was because the camera was broken when I received it, and it could no longer be used to take film photos. The shutter cloth in the back had rotted, and the cost of sourcing a new one and repairing it was more than buying a working antique Graflex camera to begin with.\n\nNevertheless, I told the family member who gave me the camera that I was going to somehow get it working again. I began to explore options for taking photos without a working shutter. One of my ideas involved putting a sheet of ground glass in the back, and scanning it. That is when I stumbled upon camera scan backs.\n\nUnfortunately, I quickly realized a commercial camera scan back costs thousands of dollars. Undaunted, I simply decided to make my own for much cheaper. The cost of making this project is about $200.\n\nOf course, for $200 you get what you pay for. This scan back only works in black and white, the photo in unevenly illuminated, and, as you can see, the rings from the fresnel lens show up overlaid atop the graphic. These are not the best digital pictures in the world, and it would be fair to say that the photos that result are a bit of an acquired taste.\n\nWhile I would get much better results simply by buying a 4X5 adapter plate for my Canon DSLR, I feel like this scan back is more in the spirit of shooting film with this camera. For starters, I can make use of the camera's native SLR mechanism (one of the first of its kind), which would not be necessary when shooting digital photos. Also, there is a kind of \"development\" involved since I can't see what I am shooting until I load it onto the computer. Also, there is unexpected artifacts and graininess like you would see with film, especially when shooting moving subjects.\n\nIt is the combination of antique technology and the element of surprise that makes using this 4X5 scan back with my camera so fun. I wouldn't say these are the best photos I've ever taken, but I had a great time getting this family heirloom working again.", "title": "DIY 4X5 Camera Scan Back", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-4X5-Camera-Scan-Back/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "If you simply place the scanner in the back of the camera where the 4X5 film cartridge normally goes, and scan the frame you will get a reasonably high resolution but narrow \"keyhole\" image.\n\nIt's difficult to figure out what part of the frame you're going to capture, but you will definitely get a high resolution photo.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8P/G54C/JOSY02ZT/F8PG54CJOSY02ZT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHD/93SX/JOSY0308/FHD93SXJOSY0308.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Scanning the Image"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "By adding a fresnel lens on top of the scan bed, you can more evenly disperse the light and get a full frame picture.

The images reflect the process from the left side. You will repeat these steps for the other side.\nWith one of the bottom bead halves, thread the wires through the hole, making sure the orientation of the bead is correct for the necklace (remember, we placed the holes above the \"equator\" of the bead so it will sit properly on the finished necklace). Slide the bead-half close to the spacer bead you added earlier.\nMeasure the distance needed for one of the insulated wires to reach the appropriate leg of the LED, and strip the silicone sheathing to that point. If necessary, trim the stripped wire so there's about 1\" of exposed wire.\nWith a new piece of wire, twist the two exposed wires together and solder to the appropriate leg of the LED. (See image) DOUBLE CHECK that you are soldering to the correct leg of the LED. Trim excess wire.\nRepeat steps 2 and 3 for the other leg of the LED. Test by turning on the switch in the battery holder. Ta Da!\nThread the two new wires through the second hole in the bead half.\nThread a spacer bead on to the two wires and thread these wires into the hole in a new bead half, checking the orientation as before, testing the connections before and after each soldering session.\nRepeat for the remaining beads on this half of the necklace. On this example, I used two LED beads on each side.\nWhen you get to the last bead on this half, don't add the new piece of wire before soldering to to the LED. Just solder the positive wire to the positive leg of the LED and the negative wire to the negative leg of the LED.\nRepeat steps 1 through 8 for the other side of the necklace.\nOn the last bead on both sides, cut a 12\" length of 2mm cording and thread through the open hole. Tie a knot (or two) on the inside of the bead half so the cording will not slip through the hole. Make sure it is small enough for the top piece to fit properly. A drop of Poly Bonder on the knot will ensure that it won't loosen during wear. This knot will be concealed inside the closed bead.\nTroubleshooting tip: If the light does not illuminate, go back to the battery holder and ensure that you are carrying the positive wire to the positive leg of the LED, and repeat for the negative wire. If the light still doesn't illuminate, consider that you may have marked the LED's legs incorrectly. All is not lost if you soldered a mistake. I've made this mistake many times and just re-heating the solder joint with the solder iron should disconnect the wire so you can start again.

You don't want to heat the battery during this process.\nMatch the top halves of the necklace beads (NOT the focal bead with the battery holder) to their bottom halves and \"dry fit\" to make sure there is a clean connection between the two. You may need to sand the bead edges to ensure a good match.\nIf you are using Poly Bonder:\nApply Poly Bonder sparingly to the edges of one bead half and place on the other half. Poly Bonder is like a super glue, so the bead halves should adhere within a few seconds. Allow to set for at least 10 minutes (or more) before moving the necklace.\nIf using Bake and Bond:\nApply Bake and Bond sparingly, and heat-set the adhesive with the embossing tool. The white adhesive will turn translucent when heated for about 15 seconds. Keep the tool moving - do not overheat or you could scorch the clay. This is a temporary bond and will be fully cured at the end.\nRepeat steps 1 through 4 for all necklace beads (NOT the focal bead with the battery holder - we will get to that later).\nOPTIONAL: Use bits of translucent clay (or a complimentary color of opaque clay) to further seal the bead halves, smoothing the clay to make a seamless connection.\nIt's time to fully cure the adhesive and any added clay to the edges of the beads.

The translucent domed LED holder also helps diffuse the light.\nSoldering is easier than you might think. I am a novice but the connections are secure. If this is the first time you've tried soldering, take a look at the many soldering tutorials online and practice a few times to gain confidence before you begin.\nA soldering iron gets HOT and will burn whatever it touches. Keep you work area free of clutter and anything flammable. STAY FOCUSED.\nWhen soldering the LEDs, DO NOT touch the soldering iron to polymer clay. It will melt it. Keep a steady hand and don't rush.\nYou can embellish the removable piece on the battery holder, but try not to add too much weight to it. The hook-and-loop fastener will hold it securely, to a point, but you don't want to risk losing it by making it too heavy for the fastener to hold it in place.\nIt is possible to add LEDs to the focal bead. Just solder the positive and negative legs to the appropriate holes on the battery holder, and make the top half of the focal bead with enough translucent clay for the light to show through.\nIf desired, glue the battery holder in place on the bottom half of the focal bead. Be careful in the placement so the battery is still easy to remove and replace.\nInstead of buying 24 AWG silicone-covered wire, you could re-purpose old ear-bud headphones and \"hack\" the wire. The wire just needs to be flexible and insulated so the necklace will hang properly and there are no short circuits.\nTroubleshooting Connection Issues\nIf the LED did not illuminate, check to be sure the positive and negative connections are correct.\nCheck that your battery is fresh and firmly seated in the battery holder.\nCheck that your soldered connections are firmly and directly soldered to the battery holder connections. If not, add a touch more solder to reinforce the connection. I haven't tested this, but adding a drop of conductive paintwork each soldering point might reinforce the connection..\nThis bears repeating: It is much easier to test your connections frequently and fix mistakes early, than it is to complete the assembly of your project and discover that the lights don't work.

Be aware that different colors used together require resistors to ensure the forward voltage is sufficient for all of the LEDs to illuminate. I have found that warm colors (red, orange and yellow) work well together, and cool colors (blue and green and white) work well together without added resistors. Some LEDs come with resistors, like THESE, enabling you to use multiple colors in the necklace without needing to compute Ohm\u2019s Law and soldering on resistors.\nI've tried a \"clamshell\" design for the bead that holds the battery holder, creating a hinge with a piece of ribbon embedded in the clay. I'm having moderate success and I prefer the ease of use with this design. While I like Velcro, it's not very \"professional\" looking in jewelry. I've tried magnets too, but learned (the hard way) that they lose their magnetic strength when heated either while curing the clay in the oven, or being too close to the hot embossing tool or soldering iron.\nWill you give this Instructable a try?

And even then it becomes part of a global system that burns a lot of diesel transporting it and running processing plants etc. It's all terribly inefficient really, so every ounce that we can reuse helps.\nPlastics tend to fit into seven categories. Each has unique properties and different melting points. The two we are going to focus on are HDPE (high density polyethylene) and PP (polypropylene). These are two of the most common waste plastics and have similar and relatively low melting/softening points. I mostly met them in the form of bottle tops which was great as they tend to come in bright colours. Another good source is milk bottles. I preferred using HDPE as it was less brittle and easier to work, so only really used PP if I was desperate for a certain colour.\nIt'll take quite a while to collect enough plastic to do something with so ask around for friends and family to collect for you too, and don't be afraid so do a cheeky scavenging lap of the block on bin day!\nThe melting point of HDPE is around 180oC, and PP is 160oC. A bit a googling told me that plastic only gives off the toxic fumes when it burns, so as long as you only heat it to it's melting point you should be ok.

Cookie cutters come in loads of different shapes so your options are wide, and if you have the means you could even make one from scratch.\nI found it was important to let the plastic cool under pressure or it contracted and twisted in awkward ways. So for each mould you'll need a piece of wood to slip inside the shape and squeeze it while it sets. Just trace the mould onto some ply and hack through it with a stanley knife and a little persistence (if you have a jigsaw or bandsaw use that!)\nFor consistent tiles you should work by weight of plastic, but you can just fill a cup to the same level if you're not too fussed.\nTo melt the plastic together I placed a metal cookie cutter on a sheet of grease proof paper in the sandwich press and poured in the measured plastic fragments. After leaving it with the lid closed for a few minutes the pieces began to soften and could be gently pressed flat with a bradawl (anything a bit \"pokey\" will do). The plastic was then left for a further 5-10mins with the lid closed to reach melting temperature so the bits of plastic would bond together.\nAfter that just whip it off the heat and with some more grease proof paper to stop it bonding on the top, slipped the piece of wood in and clamped it down for 10mins or so to cool and set.\nTo separate it from the cookie cutter I slid a stanley knife down each edge and just pushed it out. The plastic should have contracted slightly as it cooled so should push out without too much of a struggle.\nThere's likely to be a bit of spill from around the edge of the mould but this can be trimmed off with some more knifing...be careful as I picked up a couple of cuts on this step when I got complacent.\nUsing this technique you can use any cookie cutter shape you can get your hands on.

Today I\u2019m gonna share my ideas on how to make a doodle periscope!\nDoesn\u2019t it sounds exciting?before going into step I would share something to you that how I got this idea?lets go into the past, when I was in 3rd grade my class teacher gave me a book on science experiments as at that I had a great interest in \u2018 science and technology\u2019.while going through the book I just an experiment on light rays. In that this periscope was given to make it. So, I without wasting time stick to this promised myself to not to get up unless I complete this. It took around 3 hrs and I still don\u2019t know what weird stuff I made...\n\nBut now as I\u2019m grown up enough and mature enough, I\u2019m still carrying my curiosity about science and technology. For remembering my past I just made a periscope and thought to gift this sweet little thing to my cute little younger sister. I\u2019m giving this cool thing on her birthday, which very close. In first sight I thought it would be boaring after making periscope but I have started playing with it because its a cool stuff! This gift will help my sister to gain knowledge about things and this periscope will help her mind to get off watching t.v , smartphones etc. As this is an eco friendly project, so she\u2019ll be enjoying by peeking out or she will be playing spy game from this.

How it works?\nAnswer: Working Principle. A periscope works on the Laws of Reflection which states that the light from the object falls on one mirror at a 45o angle from the object and is reflected. This reflected light then falls on another mirror and is again reflected until it reaches the human eye.\n\nNow guys I hope you all are more curious like me to build up the periscope.

Many marine organisms contain fluorescent substances, and the right excitation light source can reveal surprising new colors and patterns.\u201d\nThe technique reveals a hidden psychedelic world that we can capture quite easily and through this instructable, I would like to share a DIY approach to this technique.\nThe project assumes that you will already have an underwater camera with a housing and a strobe. My strobes are INON D2000. The sizing and positioning of the excitation filters could change depending on the make/model of the camera housing and strobe used. For example if the front port is smaller or larger diameter than the measurements listed in the design, you will have to adjust accordingly. I have provided details for using 2 strobes but you will only need 1 excitation filter if only 1 strobe is used.

(Optional, additional excitation filter for a focus light)\nAs this technique relies on the two filters (excitation and barrier), I would recommend spending a little time looking into the best options available. I was able to find a local plastic fabrication company who specialized in acrylic and custom work (signage, aquariums, etc). I submitted a simple design to them (photo 2) which had allowances for the diameter of my strobe and attachment slots cut out for the elastic webbing. The cost per filter disk was only $3-4 in total. In my opinion this was much cheaper and easier than trying to source the materials and trying to cut them myself. The disks came with a protective sheet which peeled off easily (photo 3). I have included an optional design for an additional excitation filter for a focus light if you find that the strobe focus lights are not bright enough (photo 4).\nIf you are unable to find a local supplier there are options available, like Ponoko, that can do the laser cutting to your specifications and design.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5R/4QWZ/JOSXYQPR/F5R4QWZJOSXYQPR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FK1/CI9E/JOSXYSAX/FK1CI9EJOSXYSAX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWN/RZ2V/JOSXYQPQ/FWNRZ2VJOSXYQPQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYW/IN49/JOSXYUTP/FYWIN49JOSXYUTP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Supplies and Tools"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Before starting, ensure that the protective sheets on the disks are removed.\nStep 1: Insert a length of 1 inch elastic through the attachment slot on the barrier filter (photo 1).\nStep 2: Fold the elastic on to itself (photo 2) and sew the elastic together using a needle and thread. I sewed across the elastic width a couple of times for extra security. Do not pull or stretch the elastic while sewing.\nStep 3: Next, cut the elastic allowing for about 2 inches of elastic and some additional length to fold and sew over itself again, but this time sew the elastic around the thicker bungee (photo 3).\nRepeat the first 3 steps for the other attachment slots.\nStep 4: Tie the thicker bungee cord together in a ring with all the elastic tabs attached. Allow for a semi-tight fit around your camera housing port. I secured the knot ends of the bungee with 2x cable ties (photo 4, circled). Cut and attach a length of the thinner bungee for a tether, add a clip to the end in order to secure the barrier filter to the housing port. This tether will loop around the back of the housing and then secure to the thicker bungee. I used another cable tie to secure the knot ends of the tether (photo 4 circled).\nNow that the barrier filter is complete, the process is repeated for the excitation filters. The only exception to the process is that the thinner bungee cord is used for both the inner ring and tether. The tether bungee length (with clip) will most likely be shorter as this only needs to go around the back of the strobe, not the whole camera housing (photo 5).\nAs per a suggestion by another instructable editor, there are other ways to join bungee cord such as crimp head clips or using glue-filled heat shrink tube for a neat join.

It's comfortable enough to sleep on and can easily be taken with you when travelling.\nIt's not only a pillow, it's also a wonderful toy!\nYou can make it even if you have never sewn before. However please bear in mind that this master-class is not simple, it can be quite challenging for beginners, but it\u2019s a very interesting task because of its complexity!\nI have tried to give you the most detailed and clear instructions possible.\nThis is my first master-class and I'm a little nervous, so please, write your comments giving feedback of what exactly you like or dislike, and let me know if these instructions are clear enough!\nThere is an interesting fact about the photos included in this tutorial \u2013 I took them with the help of a very old, antique soviet photographic camera. It\u2019s very difficult to adjust the focus, so there were thousands of photos! But we managed to do it and I guess the photos turned out quite creative and stylish in the end!\nThis following tutorial consists entirely of the author's own ideas, instructions, patterns and photographs.\nSo, let\u2019s begin!", "title": "Decorative Pillow-toy", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Decorative-Pillow-toy/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Color spectrum\nI am giving you my choice of colors, but you can select any you like. It\u2019s not necessary to use the same shades of color in your cotton and felt, you can use different ones \u2013 with patterns or not, bright or pastel. Choose according to your own personal taste and interior design! Also, you don\u2019t have to match sewing threads with fabric but using the same or complimenting colors will result in a more coherent and appealing product.\nProduct size\n35\u044530 cm\nAll sizes in this class are in centimeters!\nNecessary equipment\nHousehold sewing machine\nNeedle for dense materials, size 80 (If not, use any).\nFabric scissors\nRuler in centimeters\nTemplate / Stencil with circles\nFabric Pencil\nSewing pins and needle\nLighter\nWhen working with felt I don\u2019t recommend using a fabric marker \u2013 it can leave very dark marks! Use a fabric pencil instead :)\nBe sure that your sewing machine is configured correctly, adjust the tension of the upper and lower threads!\nNecessary materials\n1. 100% Cotton\nAs a base for the pillow, I strongly recommend you use 100% cotton or linen. As we are making this pillow for babies and young children, choosing hypoallergenic and organic fabrics are perfect for this project! However, it is possible to use any other fabric you wish.\nIf you want to use any stretch fabrics, don\u2019t forget about back lining them for felt applique, otherwise your final result will not be as pleasing!\nSo, you need:\nCotton for the cover (I have blue) - 40 cm x 100 cm\nCotton for the inside (I have beige polka dots) - 80 cm x 40 cm\nCotton for binding and front cover (I have yellow) - 40 cm x 40 cm\nCotton for the front of the cover (I have green) - 20 cm x 40 cm\nDon\u2019t use extra thin fabrics! The cotton must keep its shape well and not let light shine through!\nSuitable density of the cotton: 120 - 150 g / sq.m\nSuitable density of the linen: 140 - 180 g / sq.m\n2. Felt\nFor this pillow I use polyester hard felt, but you can use more organic felt if you prefer - for example wool, or 50% wool felt, you can also use soft felt. But if you choose other materials, don\u2019t forget about the appropriate temperature settings for washing it!\nSuitable thick of the hard felt: 1 \u2013 1.2 mm\nSuitable thick of the soft felt: 1.2 \u2013 1.5 mm\nSuitable density of the hard or soft felt: 200 \u2013 220 g / sq.m\nOften felt is sold by the sheet, so you need 1 sheet of each necessary color. The size of the sheets can be A4, but you don\u2019t need more than 15x15 cm of each sheet for whole applique.\nI prefer Korean felt, it\u2019s non-toxic, pliable to work with, and has a good range of color palettes!\nSo, you need:\n12 sheets of felt\nI have blue, light blue, dark green, light green, yellow, orange, red, crimson, beige, white, light brown, and black.\n3. Additional materials\nSynthetic, cotton or wool hollowfiber, you need a rectangle 40x80 cm, recommended density: 150-200 g / m\nSynthetic, cotton or wool wadding, 300 g. If you prefer 100% wool wadding, please, don\u2019t forget about washing machine settings!\n12 spools of sewing threads according to the tone of the felt, 400 yards. It\u2019s better to choose threads at a sewing shop, putting the thread on the felt sheet and choosing the closest shade of color!\nThreads for the base and the inside part, according to the tone of fabrics, you don\u2019t need more than 1 spool of each. I have blue and beige.\nVelcro ribbon (soft and rough parts), you need 5 cm each. I chose the blue Velcro which matches the color of the base part of my pillow.\nEmbroidery threads in black, pink and yellow colors, density shouldn\u2019t be less than 125 grams / m.

As an artist I find it truly rewarding to research the history of such unique things. Reverse Intaglio seals and jewelry like cameos have intricately carved portraits and scenes, mostly created in Quarts, Onyx, shell, and other stone.\nThe Artisans use many tiny carving tools and painstakingly start carving out the details.\nI sought out to find similar works in resin.\n\nWhat I found was lots of vintage pieces of reverse carvings from around the 1940s created in Lucite. However, I didn\u2019t really find works cast in epoxy.\nYes, we can embed things in resin and cast things in resin, but it was this clear and semi-transparent engraved look that I was interested in. Most important was that I wanted to create not only small jewelry items but large-scale pieces.\nI went into the studio and began thinking about how I could recreate this elegant style but in Epoxy. After many tries, finally, I could say I did it.\nSo if you are interested in how to achieve the look of hand-carved Reverse Intaglio, you\u2019re in the right place.\n\nThis Ible will teach how I create intricate pieces without using drills and carving tools.\n\n\nSo let\u2019s start with the look. I pulled some photos from Google on Reverse Intaglio jewelry, this really was inspiring and gave me a great sense of the look and the amount of detail that each piece possesses.\n\nI have a few methods, but the one we are doing today is the wax version. Similar to the lost wax method in metalworking.

Use a clean, soft brush to dust and remove extra, or just mix some in the polish and keep on hand.\nFor a permanent option do all your pieces then coat the inside with clear resin to seal. This gives the piece a semi-transparent look.\nMost plastic and silicone molds have a shiny interior and that produces a shine on the resin surface if it is dull it will cast dull.\nTo color, you can paint solid with acrylic, nail polish etc. I love transparent and semi-transparent so I colored the seahorses with alcohol ink and sealed with a matte nail polish.\nThis technique can really create some great looks in our small art pieces but it can be dynamic in large projects and make the lighted piece even more amazing.\nI love the clear bowling ball with the skull in it so I hope my table will be just as cool!\nThank you!

Choose your option as to how much patterning you want on your leg (how many repeats you wish to knit). You can show one single band of pattern like the sample, or fill your leg with puzzle pieces by working the pattern again.\n3. You may also choose to knit plain rounds in the Main Color at the top of the leg and put the Puzzle Pieces pattern lower towards the ankle so it will show-off more often when wearing.\n4. If you find that your slipped stitches pucker in later rows, an option is to double wrap those stitches which will be slipped later (on Rows 2 and 10). Wrap your yarn twice around the working needle, pull both loops through. When slipping on the next round, slip just one of these loops and let the other drop.

This form of knitting does not have the same elasticity (stretch capacity) as plain stockinette knitting. This can make the sock too narrow/tight especially on the upper leg portion, and can even produce a sock that can't be pulled up over your heel area, (the widest part!).\nBelow are some suggestions for a successful project. Your goal is to have loose, slightly U-shaped, lengths of unused yarn color lying neatly across the back of your work (see photo). Although all these tips below may sound intimidating, remember that stranded color-work is really rewarding as you can select the colors and patterns that please you.\n1. Use needles that are at least one size, or even two sizes larger than you would normally use for the leg portion of the sock. For this pattern, I recommend trying a US 1 \u00bd size (2.50mm) or US size 2 (2.75mm) if you find your stranded fabric to be too tight and inelastic.\n2. Work stranded color-work by turning your sock inside out and knitting on the far side of the tube away from you. You will still see the right-side of the work inside, but will have the floats on the outside. This will force your floats into a wider circle (larger circumference) which makes them a tad longer and won\u2019t let them jump across inside corners between needles.\n3. Gently stretch out the stitches on your right-hand needle as you strand the unused yarn across the back. This will give you longer floats and greater flexibility in your fabric.\n4. For socks, overly loose stranding and gauge is preferable to short floats and tight knitting. They may appear sloppy off the leg, but when worn will stretch, flatten out and not only look nice, but will actually fit.\n5. \"Catch\" your floats if working more than 6 stitches straight of a single color. In this PUZZLE PIECES pattern, catching is only necessary on Rows 15 & 16.\n6. To manage your two yarns you have many choices. Try holding one yarn in your left hand continental style and \u201cpick\u201d and the other color yarn in your right hand and English \u201cthrow\u201d. Or simply set your yarn balls, one on each side of you and pick up and knit, then let go and drop this color. Pick up the next color and do the same. Some knitters hold both colors in one hand and pick or throw the correct color while other knitters use a special tool (Yarn Stranding Guide).\n7. When darning in your yarn tails (and yes, there are many) remember to stretch out your fabric to keep your weaving-in work as loose and elastic (stretchy) as the original knitting. The duplicate stitch method works nicely for this.\n8. Work with a wool or wool blend yarn which can be effectively wet-blocked.\n9. Gently stretch your finished wet sock in several directions to even out the stitches and floats. A gentle steaming with an iron on the \"wool\" setting and a damp cloth over your knitted fabric, press gently, often helps stubborn puckers and uneven stitch work. Do NOT do this with acrylic yarn as it will melt!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F10/IYF2/JOMTJHK6/F10IYF2JOMTJHK6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: But First - ADVICE ABOUT STRANDED COLOR-WORK ON SOCKS"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Color-work patterns are usually knit from charts, although I have provided written line-by-line instructions as well. The way we \"read\" a chart is strange to first-timers. We start at the Lower Right Hand Corner - See where the Star is on the chart above.\nThen we follow along from right - to - left. See blue arrow. So Row 1 is at the bottom of the chart and we work our way up.\nNotice that there are different colors and/or symbols in each box of the chart. There will always be a \"Legend\" to tell you what sort of knitting you need to do for the next stitch. In this case, the yellow squares are Color A and the striped squares are Color B. Later on, you will see the chart for the full Puzzle Pieces pattern which will have codes for Color C and Color D as well as an \"S\" for when you are to slip that stitch instead of knitting it.\nYou will notice that the chart is only 12 blocks wide - and we need to knit 60 or 72 stitches on each round for our sock. This is how we chart \"repeats\". You will repeat these same 12 stitches of pattern as many times as needed to get to the end of the round. In our case here, that means knit this 12-stitch repeat 5 times if you are working a medium size sock and 6 times for a large sized sock. (Because 5 x 12 = 60 and 6 x 12 = 72)\nThat's enough math! This is what the designer does when creating new ideas for knitting.\nAfter completing Round 1, you will move up to Round 2 by returning your eyes to the right side of the chart and moving up one row.

This is the only time that you will work these 4 rounds.\nBegin by simply picking up Color A (I used Red) and make a loop with about 6\" dangling as a yarn tail. Insert needle into first stitch and place this loop on it. Knit with this loop as the first stitch, then knit the next 5 sts (for a total of 6 stitches). This is the first part of Rnd 1 below. Next, pick up Color B (I used Blue), make loop, knit it, and continue until you have 6 sts of Color B as instructed below.\nTURN YOUR CUFF INSIDE OUT after working these first 12 stitches. You will now be knitting looking into the \"tube\" where the right side is inside. You will knit on the far side of the tube. This is one of the techniques to help you keep the floats of unused yarn longer. Your \"wrong side\" will be on the outside of the tube. SEE PHOTO\nNow, ignore Color B, and start knitting with Color A again following the pattern.You will have to pick up Color A from where you last used it - it is waiting there for you. Spread out those Color B stitches you just knit, gently strand Color A across the back of your work and begin knitting with it again.\nLook at the photos to see how much I have s-t-r-e-a-c-h-ed out the stitches on my right hand needle before working the first stitch of the new color. This makes the float of yarn in the back much longer so that it will hang slightly. See how it hangs in a \"U-shape\" in the photo where I've scrunched the stitches together.\nYou will be alternating knitting 6 stitches of each color all around to the beginning. The stitches at the beginning of the round where you added the new colors will be very loose. Give these a little tug when you come to them to tighten them up. Don't worry - you will darn/weave in these yarn tails later which will give you the opportunity to even up the stitch sizes. Yes, it does feel awkward with all the yarn tails, but know that it will be OK in the end.\nContinue with Rnd 2.

These works, were originally intended to bring 'new worlds' in miniature to Cornell's brother who was confined, through disability, within their New York home. It was this unique assemblage art which created a whole new genre of two and three dimensional collage. These works, also known as memory or shadow boxes, are usually made up of found objects, which are assembled within the confines of a box. Whether static or in 'penny arcade' form, the box and its objects may contain a specific narrative, pay homage to a particular person or pictorially represent a memory or event. To give you an idea, if you do not know of this genre, I include above two examples of Cornell's work. One is perhaps his most famous assemblage, the 'Untitled' Penny Arcade Portrait of Lauren Bacall' and the other is one of his beautiful parrot boxes.\nWhen a friend invited us to his birthday party and knowing he was a fellow; pallet hoarder, repurposer and dumpster diver, we decided that a pictorial biography of his life and interests within a home-made box, would be something he could appreciate. In the spirit of Cornell we decided to try and make everything from repurposed and/or found objects, or create the items ourselves from basic materials. This included the box itself and the glass.", "title": "Life Behind Glass.

This can take years or days depending on the subject and materials can be safely stored and catalogued until you are ready to complete the assemblage. For example, we have many on-going boxes, including the chicken one pictured above.\nIn the case of our friend's gift we only had a limited time before the party and most of our items could be sculpted from clay or created from repurposed materials.\nDESIGN\nAs we had decided on a biography box, we picked out some of the aspects in our friend's life that were both important to him and which we believed would come together artistically in a box. The essence of box assemblage is not to overcrowd the work but to get a flavour of the person, place, event, memory or narrative. This was quite literal in our case, as our friend is a professional baker, who had won prizes with his recipe for a local Norman dish known as La Teurgoule. He is also a passionate DIYer, pallet collector and gardener. He enjoys music and the big outdoors, including hunting and fly fishing.\nI am well aware that most people may not be in a position to find and recuperate old glass but for those of you who might be, I will include details of what I did. I also used several of my home-made tools to prepare the wood.

Much of this collection has been used to glaze our house and make greenhouses. In the older windows, the glass contains imperfections of manufacture, ripples and bubbles, features which only add to its appeal for use in artistic projects. This does however, make it more difficult to cut, so in the true spirit of Box Assemblage, the size of the glass dictates the size of the box and thus creates the restrictions of the 'world' in which to assemble the found objects. As previously mentioned, assemblages are often on-going projects, so starting with the glass and then slowly building up a collection can make for an organic process and a very satisfying final effect. Similarly, we incorporated a hinged lid, which could allow for opening and adding to the project. However, I do have a tip on cutting old glass successfully and I will link to that at the end of this 'ible, for anyone who is interested.\nCHOOSING PALLET WOOD\nUnless you are using inhouse pallets, which are not stamped but for which you will need to talk to your providers, all other pallets are stamped to identify provenance and treatment. I only ever use HT stamped pallets - this means they have been heat treated and are suitable for your projects. In the above illustration you will also see the Characters 'DB' before the 'HT', this means the pallet has been partially 'debarked', which is a process by which most of the bark is removed by cutting tools to avoid the transference of bark-living larvae, including those of the aptly named bark beetle.\nPREPARING THE WOOD\nSelect planks of the same thickness, which are the best looking and the least damaged. For the back of the box we used some tongue and groove, which had been thrown out at one of our neighbouring DIY stores but pallet wood would be fine. Some of the pallet wood I had selected for its appearance was warped, which is quite a common occurrence with pallets.\nI started by planing the upper and lower faces of the pallet wood plank. Once I had the smooth planed face of the wood, I could then proceed to deal with the warped edges.\nI attached a straight edge to the planks and ran them through my home-made router table. The straight edge ran along a guide after which I could then remove the straight edge, turn the plank over and use the new straightened edge of the plank against the guide to repeat the process on the other edge.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDA/XVE7/JOEW2EDR/FDAXVE7JOEW2EDR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0M/E7YC/JOEW2CQD/F0ME7YCJOEW2CQD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F64/ZV22/JOEW2D4U/F64ZV22JOEW2D4U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNX/P013/JOEW2D58/FNXP013JOEW2D58.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHP/IA8B/JOEW2D5A/FHPIA8BJOEW2D5A.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Using Old Glass, Choosing & Preparing the Wood"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "CONSTRUCTION OF THE BOX\nThis was a very simple and easy design, accomplished by just joining the wood of the box frame face to face aka a butt joint. This type of joint is suitable for use when you are attaching a backing to a piece and thus giving it additional strength.\nThe walls were thus assembled using butt joints, glued and nailed. The rear face of tongue and groove can be tacked or stapled in place thus reinforcing and stiffening the structure.\nI fitted two recuperated hinges and a catch fashioned from a piece of wood and the box was ready for its lid.\nCONSTRUCTION OF THE LID\nI removed the glass from the recuperated window and cleaned the putty from the edges with a sharp knife.\nOn measuring the glass thickness, I found that my circular saw would cut a groove of adequate width to fit. I then cut the groove in two of the planed planks and then cut strips from them to make the frame components.\nThe sawn edge of the grooved strips was 'cleaned' using the router.\nThe strips were cut to length to fit the glass and I decided to have mitred (picture frame) corners, so I used my home-made hand sander to tidy up the cut ends.

These included flower pots, a plaque with a prize trout, a fishing basket complete with a fish, croissants and baguettes. Some of them were made from clay sections which were firstly rolled like pastry and cut to shape. The basket for example was formed from three pieces of flat clay, which were then scored with a knife to look like the basket had been woven. The croissants were made from flattened out clay, cut into triangles and then rolled up like real crescent rolls.

There are a lot of wallet designs out there and it is difficult to pick what works best for all occasions. In my quest to slim down my possessions and all the junk in my life I decided that it was time for an absolute minimalist wallet; two pockets, the ability to hold 3 - 4 cards and a small wad of cash. Living in the city, I often like to carry my wallet in the front pocket to make it more difficult for thieves so it needs to stay thin.\nHere's what I came up with and I hope it works for you too.", "title": "Minimalist Wallet", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Minimalist-Wallet/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Difficulty Level - Beginner\nThis isn\u2019t a complicated project and might be a good one to start with if you trying your hand at leatherworking for the first time.\nIt would be pretty optimistic to just dive in and start cutting out a wallet without knowing what needs to fit inside. I used a debit card for scale as there will inevitably be a couple of these in just about any modern traveler\u2019s pocket. I didn\u2019t need to put a lot of time into the pattern as I have made similar styles before and knew the basics of what I wanted; essentially two pockets and very little sewing. It is easy to make a wallet that is too thick so that constraint must be kept in mind during the design process.\nHow many layers of leather? How thick are the layers? How much should it hold?\nTo create two pockets, there needs to be three layers; two on the outside and one to divide. To make the cards more accessible, the outer pocket will be a \u201creveal\u201d and I chose to do this the simplest way possible, by a diagonal straight line.\nI ended up tightening the width and lengthening the entirety just a bit from my original estimates for a better fit. With that, the difficult part is over.\nAfter the pattern is transferred to the card stock, it can be used many times without fuss. It is a very good idea to label your patterns before storage as they begin to look alike when you amass a large folder of them (was this a pocket, part of a shoe, a purse, some sort of handle cover?).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2P/QK8Y/JOEW29OU/F2PQK8YJOEW29OU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1J/IT5D/JOEW2A9T/F1JIT5DJOEW2A9T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEQ/XNW7/JOEW29TV/FEQXNW7JOEW29TV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUO/SSRI/JOEW29ZB/FUOSSRIJOEW29ZB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Making the Pattern"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The next step is to cut out the pattern on appropriate leather. I\u2019m using Hermann Oak 1.5 mm tooling side that was leftover from an earlier project but nearly any thin leather will do. Neatness in cutting is very important as it will affect the look of the entire piece if the cuts are even a millimeter or two off or wavering in any way. Don't worry though, this gets easier over time.\nThe pattern:\nA rectangle 3 3/4\" by 7 3/4\" should serve you well. You can shorten the long measurement by about 1/16\" if using very thin leather as less will be lost in the folds.\nCut it out, fold it up while slightly damp, press it flat, adjust the length if necessary before sewing.\nSince most people seem to prefer dark leathers for this sort of thing I chose to dye it Medium Brown with Fiebings Leather Dye. Follow the instructions on the bottle as different brands vary somewhat.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FY5/XUKF/JOEW2AFX/FY5XUKFJOEW2AFX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVK/KQ1S/JOEW2A4S/FVKKQ1SJOEW2A4S.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Clicking - Cutting It Out"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "After the dye sets you\u2019re free to move on. I started by marking and awling the stitching holes at about a 5 mm increment or a little wider if you really dislike stitching. I will admit, this was not my straightest set of stitching lines ever but this is just a prototype and it will look fine in the end.\nI almost always use a double needle saddle stitch when sewing leather as it is the best and strongest choice in in almost every case. If you are unfamiliar with this technique, no fear! The lovely Jessy has a simple tutorial for you right here: Saddle Stitch Tutorial. I chose a contrasting 1 mm saddle stitch thread to give it a fine finished look but that is obviously a matter of personal opinion.\nAnd finally, the edges were dyed again and burnished with a wooden burnishing tool to create a smooth, finished look. (Learn how to burnish here). Overall, I\u2019m quite satisfied with the outcome. This one will be the prototype to work from and I\u2019ll be able to take a little more care now that I have learned from this one.

But in my googl-search i stumbled across a picture of wire art, more specifically a wire tree (of life), and fell in love with it instantly!\nNever having done any kind of jewelry making i challenged myself to give it a try. I really thought i had 'dug my own grave' with this project but as it turned out it wasnt all that difficult!\nThe gold with green one is the result of about 4 hours of meticulous wire-weaving and stone-fitting and is my first one!\nAs soon as i showed her (by videocall) she fell in love with it! As soon as she showed a friend of hers, she wanted to 'order' one aswell as she to fell in love with the pendant! Then i showed my mother, she wanted one for a friend who has a simular tree-picture on her buisnesscard! Even my dad was impressed! :o\ngetting so much positive feedback, and having a couple more to make, i decided to do a 'ible about how i put these together.\nChoosing gemstones\nTo make this project a very personal one, either for yourself or the one you're making this for, consider using gemstones that line up with their Zodiac sign, chinese zodiac sign, chakra, favorite color, problems that they have or attributes that need a little encouragement! Gemstones have been used for thousands of years in relation to fysical and emotional betterment and problem-solving and have a positive working on the human vibration.\nThere are tons of gems, colors, shapes and sizes to choose from and there is an equal amount of information to be found on internet when searching for it. Not all sites are to be trusted though... so when searching for a appropriate stone, scoure more than a couple of sites and see/ choose one that is represented at all the sites. I asked my local gemstone retailer which site they use and kinda follow in their footsteps! (it's a dutch site, srry non-dutchies!)\nExample; my girlfriend is a Virgo and there were at least 3 stones that every site lists; carnelian, lapis lazuli and blue sapphire. I wanted to go with the sapphire, expensive and not very commonly seen I thought i'd be the best choice. But you can't find them in chip-size (2-5mm) and ordering one on the internet would run me a hefty bill. So the next best thing was/ is her favorite color; darkgreen. This offcourse would be a perfect color since were making a tree. i was considering bloodstone (dutch; heliotroop), Mos-agath and Jade but ended up with Ruby in Zoisiet.

I originally went on the hunt looking for retired/worn sailcloth and found that used sails that were still in good enough shape to use for my bag were far too expensive to make this economical. It turns out new sailcloth is much more affordable in my findings.\n\nI made my first bag with 7.4oz dacron \"supercruise\" sailcloth from sailrite. I found it exceptionally difficult to work with even on my Janome HD1000 heavy duty machine with leatherworking needles. If you plan on attempting this bag with Dacron sailcloth, I suggest trying a lighter weight variant. 4oz may be a better choice.\nI eventually settled on 1000D Cordura nylon from RockyWoods for my second bag. It sews like denim and I found it much easier than Dacron to work with. It has less structure, but this tradeoff makes it more pliable and easier to maneuver around and through the sewing machine.1.5oz ripstop nylon from sailrite was used for the bag liner.\nI attempted using 2 different zippers - a #10 molded zipper and a #10 coil zipper. The coil zipper moves much easier around the bend.\nOther hardware and miscellaneous items:\nHeavy polyester upholstery thread. I used V-92 thread from sailrite. This does push the limits of a home sewing machine. 16/100 denim needles for Cordura, 16/100 leather needles for dacron.\nIf buying 200yd spools at a craft store, pick up 3 of them. You don't want to run out.\nPrep 4 bobbins of this. You will use almost all of it.\n1\" \"seat belt\" polyester webbing - I found this from strapworks\n1\" tri-glides x 5 (one for the strap, and I used 4 of them to attach the handles) Mine came from amazon.\nHK Snap Hook/Snap Clip with Bandage Clip - these are available from many sellers, I found mine on etsy. 2 of each needed.\nRare earth magnets, available online and in home improvement/hardware stores\n2 short dowel pieces for the handles\nFlexible cutting board or clear desk mat for hard bottom panel\n.148\" spring steel wire for the bag frame - McMaster Carr part # 9667K56\nSteel rod from a home improvement store can work, but will not retain its shape if bent at all.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGO/P9UH/JNZ4C24Z/FGOP9UHJNZ4C24Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP0/Q6OS/JNZ4C3QP/FP0Q6OSJNZ4C3QP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVP/54TR/JNZ4C3RI/FVP54TRJNZ4C3RI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Materials and Hardware"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Like most sewing projects, prep starts with getting our cloth cut out.\n\nI purchased the patterns on paper. In the US, the paper patterns are a better value than purchasing the PDF and trying to get it printed yourself at a big box office supply/print center store.\nBack the paper patterns with something heavier. I used brown craft paper and super 77 spray adhesive. This will allow you to use the pattern over and over again.\nThere's a few notes and issues with the pattern:\nThe pattern says to cut 1 strap loop. You need two.\nYou can skip the 5/8\" webbing and use a bandage clip, triangle clip or D ring instead. I found this to be preferable and used a bandage clip.\nThe pattern calls the attachment for the handles a \"D ring\" but it's more of a rectangular ring. for continuity I actually used the same tri-glide I used on the strap in place of a \"D ring\"\nThere's conflicting information on the pattern for the bottom panel. You only need one outer panel, and one inside panel. The \"bucket\" around the main bag is really a false piece that's there for aesthetics and add some structure to the bag. You do not need to cut and sew a 3rd fabric bottom.Just the two the pattern itself shows on the component (one with your outer fabric, and one with your inner fabric). The hard bottom can slip out of place in rare circumstances. I haven't managed to make that happen yet.\nThe order of operations on the pattern is not clear.

Be sure to also mark placement for hardware and cloth details like rings, zippers, the secondary panels and more.\nOn my first attempt I used a supposedly \"water soluble\" marking pencil, and could not get it to wash out of the dacron or ripstop completely. On the second attempt, I purchased an inexpensive chalk wheel - and while the marks were a little harder to see it brushes out easily and worked very well.\nAssembling this bag is unintuitive to most people with little sewing experience. Start with details first while focusing on completing panels individually. Remember with ALL sewing operations to run forward and reverse for a couple stitches to keep things locked in. If you don't, the bag will eventually unravel.\nThe handles\nPrep your dowels/magnets and insert them into your sewn handles.\nSew the handles together. Rolling over the edges and doing a top stitch looks best in my opinion.\nInsert the dowels.\nSew your D rings/tri glides to the ends of the handles. Make sure everything will be symmetrical when putting it on the bag.\nClip or pin the cloth retainers for the handle d rings together and sew to the bag where designated.\nA zipper foot may give you a little extra room to sew close to the hardware.\nBandage clips\nClip or pin the cloth retainers for the bandage clips together, with the clips in them.\nSew them to the bag.\nHook and loop/patches\nSew any hook and loop or patches you want on the bag exterior on the main and secondary panels.\nRemember to keep in mind the side of the cloth will be the exterior on the secondary panels.\nAs the instructions say, sew the secondary panels on to the main panels.\nI believe it looks best folded over with a top stitch.\nSwap to a new bobbin at this point. You don't want to run out of thread in the middle of this operation.\nAssemble the bag exterior inside out.\nAttach the sides together into a \"tube\"\nIt is most important that the secondary panels line up, as it forms a visible constant line around the entire bag.\nSew the bottom panel around the bottom perimeter of the \"tube\".", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTI/4NW8/JNZ4C06O/FTI4NW8JNZ4C06O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIU/NGBL/JNZ4C06P/FIUNGBLJNZ4C06P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRO/6PFJ/JNZ4C07B/FRO6PFJJNZ4C07B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZT/X0UM/JNZ4C06R/FZTX0UMJNZ4C06R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTB/50J6/JNZ4C06T/FTB50J6JNZ4C06T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY0/TV5F/JNZ4C06W/FY0TV5FJNZ4C06W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7L/OHGR/JNZ4C06X/F7LOHGRJNZ4C06X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7A/L5IA/JNZ4C079/F7AL5IAJNZ4C079.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Part Prep and Exterior Order of Operations."}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Building the interior is very similar to the exterior in process.

Assembling the completed components of the bag. You will be sewing through many layers of fabric at the same time, and even with basic cotton fabrics, some entry level machines will struggle with this. A heavy duty sewing machine or an older mechanical one such as the Singer 4411/23 etc or Janome HD1000 is recommended for this project. If your machine is also an embroidery machine, I would definitely avoid using it for these steps - embroidery machines can be very delicate and you don't want to throw off the timing or damage anything.\nPrep:\nInstall the hard plastic bottom in the bottom inside of the outer bag - it sits in there loose.\nPlace the internal bag inside the external bag.\nClip around the perimeter of the entire bag.\nUse the corners/seams as reference. The seams of both parts of the bag should meet exactly.\nSeperate the zipper. Alignment is not important at this time. Just make sure you have about 4\" of zipper hanging off of either end.\nAdd the zipper, upside down and backwards to the outer opening of the bag. This may seem unintuitive, but it will be flipped around so the zipper will be correct in an upcoming step.\nBe sure to pay very close attention to the zipper stop points on the pattern. If you sew the zipper on past there it will be difficult or impossible to open and close the bag.\nAdd the long strip as shown in the photos to the bag over top of the zipper. It will leave an opening on one side of the bag near a zipper opening. I've tried to show this in my photos.\nSewing:\nWe're getting into some heavy duty stuff here, so please be mindful of your tension - you'll want it pretty high. This would be a good time to get out a new needle as well. Put on a full bobbin even if it isn't empty. You don't want to go back and fix things at this stage.\nNow, you'll need to maneuver the entire bag onto your sewing machine, either side can be down depending on what is easier for you to work with.\nStarting and stopping at each zipper stop point, do a single top stitch binding the liner, outer bag, zipper, and frame sleeve together. A zipper foot may help you stitch it close to the zipper coils, but a zig zag foot right at the edge of the coils will do fine. This stitch will only be visible along the zipper.\nCheck at multiple points to make sure you're capturing all 4 layers.\nBetween the start and stop points for each zipper sew the inner and outer bag and frame sleeve together, being careful not to stitch the zipper at all.\nNow you'll need to fold over the edge of the frame sleeve (like a hem), flip the zipper around so it looks normal on the bag, and stitch the frame sleeve around its full length.Some clips will help hold the hem/fold in place. This will result in a visible top stitch around the whole bag. If your tension is okay, it will appear like a top stitch no matter which side you sew from. I preferred to do this with the frame sleeve up so I could keep an eye on where I was stitching.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVK/ON62/JNZ4C075/FVKON62JNZ4C075.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC7/CVEF/JNZ4C076/FC7CVEFJNZ4C076.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS0/2H0E/JO8XYO2W/FS02H0EJO8XYO2W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM0/NJ40/JNZ4C078/FM0NJ40JNZ4C078.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDP/0LGQ/JNZ4C073/FDP0LGQJNZ4C073.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Final Assembly of the Bag."}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Almost there!\nThis is the part where we need to pay attention to zipper alignment. Try and align the seams at the corners of the bag as best as possible, and zip one zipper pull on from each end. Trim the zipper on each end so the two sides are even. Only trim it if you're 100% happy with the alignment, otherwise go back and fix it. You should still have around 3+ inches hanging loose.\nZipper ends now need to be sewn on. Be careful when sewing over the coils. It's recommended to run your machine by hand over the coils so you can get a feel for the needle. Running it with the foot pedal risks breaking a needle.\nFor the frame you'll need to cut and bend your spring steel. It comes with quite a bit of oil/carbon on it from the hardening process. Clean that off thoroughly with mineral spirits and a rag - you don't want to get this on a bright white bag. I believe I cut two pieces at 23 1/2\" with an angle grinder, but a hack saw will do. I did the bends about 3 3/4\" in from each side. The bend radius will make up for extra little bit of length on the main part of the bag. put on some heat resistant gloves or an old oven mitt. Heat the rod at the mid point of where you want the bend, and when it's red hot start your bend. Try and concentrate the flame in that one spot. Mapp-pro gas is recommended to heat it quickly. Heating too much of the rod will cause parts of it to lose its spring properties. Let it cool, do not quench. It's not a bad idea to file the ends smooth.\n\nWhen you insert the frame into the sleeve on each side, just make sure the pointy end is always moving straight. If it digs into fabric it may cause a rip or pull a seam out.\nThe strap is pretty straightforward. Just two clips and a tri-glide. For seat-belt webbing a leather needle is recommended. For standard nylon and polyester webbing a standard point needle is fine, or you can use the same denim needle.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIB/Z9AZ/JNZ4C07A/FIBZ9AZJNZ4C07A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEE/Q9WJ/JNZ4C07C/FEEQ9WJJNZ4C07C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F55/Y1SJ/JNZ4C07D/F55Y1SJJNZ4C07D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3B/83IV/JNZ4C07G/F3B83IVJNZ4C07G.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Finishing Touches and the Frame."}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "You can now start filling your bag and using it.

The stock had all been previously planed to just \u00be\u201d thick. This thickness requires two pieces to be glued together in order to have enough thickness for carving the stool seats. In order to do this, I broke down the Cedar, using a miter saw, into six pieces approximately 18\u201d long. Doing a little mix and match I found which two of any of the six would make the best match for the glue up. In order to get the best surfaces for gluing that would allow for the least number of gaps, I used a belt sander to remove mill marks and rough patches on the gluing side of all six boards. I used 40 grit sandpaper on the belt sander in order to be the most efficient in prepping the glue up side and then applied Titebond Iglue to the newly smoothed wood and used 8 clamps for each set to get firm and complete pressure across the whole seat surface.

The Works sold a three box set of ply book shaped boxes. Next I thought out what I would need to make a wooden box look like an ancient tome.

I did a quick scale sketch of the Necronomicon design I wanted, using some images commonly found on the internet as inspiration. This was then stuck to the face of the box. I then covered all of the boxes visible faces and edges with a white paper, so as to provide a good base for the paper mache later. The sides of the box which would be where the page edges would show, were covered in a pre measured sample of wallpaper, using a strong and sticky PVA. This sample took ages to find in a local DIY store.. it had to be light enough to paint, and be embossed with lines, so as to resemble page edges. Now time to fit the EL panels. I stuck them down with double sided tape, I personally did not want to risk a glue reacting with the back of the plastic EL panels, messing up the lights. You can cut the small EL panels to size, but I again erred on the side of caution and left them whole. The smaller 5cm \u00d7 6cm panels were used for the eyes, the larger 10cm \u00d7 10cm panel was used for the mouth. Next, using the sketch I made, I measured out the eyes and mouth on the back of the red transluscent acrylic. The acrylic came with a protective film on both sides, so just use a Sharpie to mark them out. I allowed an extra 5mm around the eyes, to allow the paper mache to hold the eyes and mouth in place later on, and provide a raised edge to give the illusion of depth. I did not stick the acrylic eyes and mouth on directly to the EL panels, as this would effect the light source. Simply secure at the edges with masking tape (the paper mache will later cover this and it provides a sound bonding material). The wires that are attached to the panels are quite thin, but the sockets used to attach them to the inverter cable are quite large.. about 6mm, so drill holes about 6mm just below the eye and mouth panels. Push the sockets through to the inner box section, and secure and cover with more masking tape. Finally, to make the spine of the box look more book like, I decided to fit some thin cardboard strips at the top, middle and bottom. Do not cut these to fit to the edge of the spine.. leave a 3mm gap each side, so that when they are covered in paper mache, it provides a more rounded finish which adds to the book illusion.

Next, to add realism to the face and give a more natural old weathered skin effect, mix white acrylic with the brown to make a slightly lighter shade. Then drybrush all the edges of the box, and raised areas of the eye sockets, mouth, and raised book spine. Repeat this using slightly lighter shades several times. This will give a really impressive worn skin effect. To get the page edge illusion, use a black paint wash to fill the line edge relief, on the already fixed wallpaper sample. Leave to dry, then start dry brushing the ridges with a light brown paint, colour matched with an old parchment colour.

At first glance it seems like an easy way to create art, a way of capturing a breathtaking scene with the click of a button.\nBut when you start delving into photography, you slowly start learning more and more about its little quirks - those things that can make a picture very right, and those that will make one very wrong. Often it can take years for a photographer to get good, and so called \"beginner's guides\" are often full of technical details and hard-to-understand concepts.\nSo where does Instructables come in? I've been photographing for a couple of years now as a hobby, and I wanted to share my knowledge with the world. I've researched for countless hours, and I have lots of experience getting out there and simply photographing things, learning from my mistakes in the process.\nI wouldn't say I am an expert photographer, and I wouldn't say that my advice is the best out there. However, in my opinion this makes me more qualified to write a beginner's guide to photography. I can distinctly remember a time when I had no idea about any of the rules governing the subject, and I can recall my struggles and (eventual) successes when starting out. As such, I know the things that most beginners need to know, those nitty-gritty details that make or break a photographer, which all too often are overlooked amidst the technicalities.\nSo will this Instructable be perfect? No. But I hope that you walk out of here with a better understanding and appreciation of the world of photography.", "title": "Starting Photography: a Beginner's Guide", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Starting-Photography-a-Beginners-Guide/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "There are a wide variety of cameras in today's world. You should choose which one you are going to use before delving into the details of this Instructable. I would recommend choosing a camera suited to your purposes and price point. Here are the main types of cameras on the market:\n1) Smartphones should be any photographer's secret weapon. Smartphones today boast cameras that are better than most cameras were a long time ago. They automatically adjust most of the settings for you and allow you to enjoy that vacation without having to lug around a heavy camera.\n2) Point-and-shoot cameras are meant for the aspiring photographer. They are really compact (hence their other name, compact cameras) and can be put in one's pocket. They are often incredibly cheap, and they have a surprising number of features as such. These are great for people aspiring to try out photography without any kind of commitment. Note that if you ever want to take your photography professional, you are going to want to move on from point-and-shoots relatively quickly. Nevertheless, they are great for carrying around on vacations and to other places when you really don't want to be lugging around all of your equipment.\n3) Bridge Cameras bridge the gap between DSLRs and point-and-shoots. These cameras are cheaper and require you to buy fewer parts (lenses are often built in). However, this comes at the cost of quality, and today DSLRs are so cheap, it makes sense to spend a few hundred dollars on a camera you can use for life, rather than trying to make a cheaper camera work.\n4) Mirrorless Cameras were made to take away all of the confusion behind DSLRs. Instead of having a viewfinder that you look through, mirrorless cameras show you what the camera's sensor sees instead. This redesign allows mirrorless cameras to be compact. They are also easier to use, since you can see the exposure settings of your camera in real-time. There are still a few downsides to these cameras, but as time goes by they are getting better and better.\n5) DSLRs are those large, heavy, and expensive cameras you see professional photographers hauling around. They offer the best of the photography world, but pay the price in convenience and affordability. They also require you to buy a lot of other things, such as lenses and filters, to use them to their full advantage.\n6) Full-Frame Cameras are a type of DSLR that have a larger sensor than most others. This is because the sensor inside the average DSLR is actually a crop sensor. Having a full size sensor enables one to take better quality photos. They are very expensive, so you might want to do some research before buying one.\nThis Instructable will mostly focus on photography using DSLRs, simply because most of the information translates pretty nicely to other devices. People even make miniature lenses and tripods and such for phones, so it can't hurt to learn about them.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FE5/1ZLA/JNIQKOKC/FE51ZLAJNIQKOKC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCQ/27J5/JN3HVJ7L/FCQ27J5JN3HVJ7L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHC/YXEG/JNAL6RB1/FHCYXEGJNAL6RB1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWZ/148D/JN8YDVRT/FWZ148DJN8YDVRT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Cameras"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Lenses help change how the camera \"sees\" the environment around it. There are a lot of different ways to categorize lenses, which we will discuss in this step.\nCategorizing by Range\nOne huge factor that influences buying decisions is convenience. Instead of having to own a dozen lenses that all have different focal lengths, you can own a single lens that can zoom in or out. However, this might not be the bargain it seems to be.\nName Description\nZoom Lenses Zoom lenses allow you to change how close or far away something looks. These are perfect for beginners who want to dabble with various focal lengths. However, as they say, \"a jack of all trades is a master of none.\" Zoom lenses pay for their convenience with reduced quality because of all of the moving parts inside that may or may not coordinate as well as a prime lens.\nPrime Lenses Prime lenses have a fixed focal length. This means that it can't zoom in or out. It also means that whoever designed the lens made it so it perfectly works at the exact focal length it was made for, instead of having to make it work for an entire range of focal lengths.\nPersonally, I use a zoom lens simply for the convenience. But if you want to specialize in, say, portrait photography, you might want to invest in a single prime lens that will work for that purpose.\nCategorizing by Focal Length\nLenses can be further sorted by their focal length. Focal length essentially determines how zoomed in or out an image looks to our eye.\nName Focal Length Description\nFisheye Lens 5 - 15 mm A fisheye lens makes photos look like what a fish can see - a \"bowl\" that bulges in the center. This is because of how the lens is shaped - fisheye lenses are just very extreme wide angle lenses.\nWide Angle Lens 10 - 42 mm A wide angle lens takes in more of the surrounding environment by having a shorter focal length. These are great for landscape shots, especially because they allow you to get closer and avoid objects cluttering the foreground. They are also frequently used indoors, where there isn't much space to begin with.\nNormal Lens 43 - 50 mm A normal lens lets you take photos pretty much the same as the human eye can see. This lens is commonly known as the \"nifty fifty\", since they traditionally come at 50mm and are very versatile.\nTelephoto Lens > 100 mm A telephoto lens lets you photograph things from far away by having a longer focal length. These are especially great for wildlife photography, so you don't have to approach anything potentially dangerous or risk aggravating it. People use these at sporting events or concerts, too (if they allow you to do so), since it can be hard to get a good seat.\n\nNote that the focal lengths for these lenses are approximate. The exact classification is based on the sensor of the camera a lens is on, also. Make sure to do some research for the exact camera you plan on purchasing so you get what you want.\nCategorizing by Ability\nThere are also a handful of lenses that are designed for some specific purpose or feature. These can be used to achieve special effects or just make it easier to take certain types of pictures.\nName Description\nMacro Lens A macro lens is a lens that is able to focus on things very close up (generally inches away from your camera). These are used to take pictures of everything from insects to flowers to textures of various things.\nImage Stabilization Lens An image stabilization lens has sensors and servo motors inside that help it stabilize your shot even if your hand shakes. These don't eliminate movement, but they help tremendously, especially when at higher focal lengths or slower shutter speeds. Many lenses nowadays have this feature.\nTilt-Shift Lens A tilt-shift lens is very self-explanatory. It enables you to shift the lens physically left / right and up / down. It also lets you tilt the lens up or down without moving the camera body. The purpose of this lens is to minimize distortions, especially in architecture. It can also be used for a miniature effect, where things (especially people) look smaller than they really are. Often people describe it as the subjects looking like game pieces on a game board.\nWhen purchasing lenses, make sure that they are specifically designed for your camera. Otherwise, they might not even fit on your camera or might produce photos at a reduced quality. Make sure that your gear is all of the same brand (Canon, Nikon, etc) and even of the same line (Canon Rebel, etc) unless it is directly stated that it will work with another camera.\nOften the best thing for a beginner is a starter's kit which comes with a camera and lenses, batteries, etc. all specifically designed for a certain camera. These are often at a reasonable price point and contain enough for you to experiment with before you spend any substantial amount of money.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCF/W7HT/JNIQKM4X/FCFW7HTJNIQKM4X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7R/Z798/JNAL6RCN/F7RZ798JNAL6RCN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD7/PXED/JNAL6RCQ/FD7PXEDJNAL6RCQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Lenses"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Filters change the way a photo looks. Filters can have a variety of purposes, from protecting your camera to allowing you to take certain types of shots to improving the aesthetic appearance of your photos.\nThe good thing is most filters are cheap, so you can afford to experiment with them. Here are some of the most common filters that you should try out:\nName Purpose Description\nUV Filter Protection from UV light and from the environment\nA UV filter protects your camera from harmful UV light when shooting outdoors. However, an additional benefit is that since they don't change how the photo turns out much, you can keep it on your camera anytime you are using it to protect your more expensive lenses from dirt, dust, water, etc.\nPolarizing Filter Used for reducing glare from reflections and regulates color saturation\nA polarizing filter regulates color saturation and reduce glare from reflections. These are great when shooting through a glass window of some sort also because they reduce the window glare.\nNeutral Density Filter Used for long exposures and bright environments\nA neutral density filter darkens your photo so you can lengthen the exposure time you use, especially when shooting in bright lighting outdoors. These come in various strengths.\nGraduated Neutral Density Filter Used for balancing exposure throughout a photo\nWhile neutral density filters affect the entire shot, graduated filters only affect the top half of a photo. This is primarily used to help darken the sky to balance with the foreground.\nTinted Filter Used for special effects\nYou can also find various tinted filters that are for changing the tint of your photos. I prefer to do this in post processing just in case I change my mind about a particular tint.\nNote that some filters screw on to the end of your lens, and some filters are simply square sheets that require you to use some sort of holder to keep them in place. While filters are more universal than lenses, make sure that you get the right size filter, so you don't see any distortions in the final image.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFY/VHN5/JNIQKLVC/FFYVHN5JNIQKLVC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Filters"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "When you are taking a photo, you want to hold your camera as steady as possible. This is to avoid blur. It is also very important in that it lets you position your camera upfront instead of having to re-adjust after every shot. This is where stabilizers come in.\nPurchasing Stabilizers\nThere are a lot of great products on the market that are used to stabilize your camera and hence improve the quality of your photos. Here are 3 of the most common ones.\nName Description\nTripods\nTripods are the most common form of stabilizers. They have 3 legs, which makes the camera very stable, especially for long exposures. They help a photographer keep the camera in the same position, so you don't have to re-adjust how you hold your camera for every shot.\nMonopods\nMonopods are tripods with one leg. These are better than tripods when in dynamic situations because they are easy to move around.\nFlexible, Portable Tripods These tripods are less common than regular tripods. They are small and have bendable legs. This means that in addition to using them like a normal tripod, you can also wrap the legs around things like tree branches and lamp posts for a quick solution.\nOther Solutions\nIf you don't have any of these, you can also use the things around you. If you are sitting down, prop your camera on your legs. If you are in a blind, maybe rest your camera on a rock or on the ground. If you are in a public area, you could even rest your camera against railings.\nWhen all else fails, pull your camera towards you to stabilize it with your body, stand as still as possible, and lightly press the shutter. Adaptability means you will have more opportunities than those who rely on external equipment to get their photos.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTJ/C5FK/JNIQKM1T/FTJC5FKJNIQKM1T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1U/SQWN/JN3HVJMF/F1USQWNJN3HVJMF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH4/HOK0/JN3HVJT3/FH4HOK0JN3HVJT3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Stabilizers"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "It can be fairly easy to figure out how to use less advanced cameras, like phone cameras and point-and-shoot cameras. DSLRs are a bit trickier, and they have some additional things you need to know about them.\nThese skills might translate over to some other types of cameras, but they are often most commonly found in DSLRs.\nMode\nThe main modes you need to know how to use are Automatic, Program, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, and Manual modes. While some of the terms used below might not make much sense to you just yet, we will discuss them in detail in the \"Exposure\" section of this Instructable.\nMode Description\nAutomatic Everything is fully automatic in this mode. Your camera will determine what it thinks is best for the environment around you, and all you have to do is aim your camera and press the shutter.\nProgram In program mode, the camera will automatically calculate the right exposure by evaluating how much light is entering the sensor and then adjusting for the ISO (which can be manually set). In this mode you can also control things like flash.\nAperture Priority This mode is like program mode, except the only value the camera will calculate is the shutter speed, based on the aperture and ISO you are using.\nShutter Priority This mode is like program mode, except the only value the camera will calculate is the aperture, based on the shutter speed and ISO you are using. This is what I use the most, since shutter speed can make a huge difference when photographing different things.\nManual In this mode, everything is set by you, the user. This can be good and bad - if you happen to see something cool and want to quickly photograph it, you might not have gotten the settings right and the moment is gone. What you can do in these situations is take a photo in manual if you have the time and switch over to automatic and take a shot just in case.\nWhen first starting out I would recommend using automatic mode. However, after taking a lot of photos, you will be able to see what your camera does wrong. You might realize that it shouldn't have turned on flash or shouldn't have used such a slow shutter speed. Then you can slowly start experimenting with other modes.\nSaving Your Photos\nYou obviously want to take the best pictures possible.This means that you want to save your files at the largest size possible so the least amount of information is lost. If this means you have to buy another $15 SD card, so be it. It will be well worth it.\nThe next question people always have is if they should be shooting in RAW. When light hits a camera's sensor, the camera has to convert this information into a JPEG. But then the camera discards all of that sensor information to save storage space. What if you were to instead keep the information so you could choose how to process your photo?\nThat is the essence of a RAW file. When you put a RAW file into a software like Adobe\u00ae Photoshop\u00ae software, you can edit the file to your liking and then save it as a JPEG.\nInitially, you should be shooting in JPEG form, as you might not have the time or will to process every single photo you take. As you start getting better and better at photography, you should start using RAW more and more to truly unlock its capabilities.\nAuto Focus vs Manual Focus\nAuto focus should be your friend. Most lenses have an auto focus feature, which lets your camera decide when it thinks the image is as sharp as possible. This can be more reliable than trying to manually focus yourself.\nThe reason people use manual focus is when the camera chooses the wrong thing to focus on. Say there is a really prominent foreground in your photo. The camera might choose to focus on that instead of the subject.\nAnother thing is cameras don't do too well at the extremes when it comes to auto focus. If you are photographing something that is closer or farther away than your lenses' range, you might want to use manual focus to get better results. When there is a lot of depth to your photo, your camera might not know which \"layer\" to focus on. Also, if your camera moves, it might try to re-focus, losing time in the process.\nFlash\nFlash helps illuminate your subject with a quick burst of light from your camera. I use flash whenever it is too dark and I don't want to worry about exposure settings or whenever I need to light up some element of my photo (such as texture).\nThere isn't really any hard-and-fast guide to when to use flash. After you really start practicing photography a lot, you will get a feel for when to use flash and when to just adjust your exposure settings.\nOne thing to be weary of is that many places don't let you use flash, since they don't want you to distract the audience or performers. In these cases, you should switch over to program mode, so your camera doesn't accidentally choose to use flash.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQR/F9IE/JNIQKLWT/FQRF9IEJNIQKLWT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXC/IRIK/JN8YDNEB/FXCIRIKJN8YDNEB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR0/CQTL/JN4VHSM0/FR0CQTLJN4VHSM0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Using Your DSLR"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "At a very generic level, photography is all about recording light in the form of photos. If you don't have enough light, your photos won't turn out very well. Luckily, there are many different light sources you can use to make your photos brighter.\nIn this step, I will also teach you how to make a light box and a reflector, so you can take photos regardless of your surroundings.\nLight Sources: Outdoors\nLighting is incredibly important. I always tell people that if they just can't make it work inside, take it outside, where the lighting is more ambient and the temperature is more neutral.\nThe two images above show how evenly the ambient light from the sun is on the surface of complicated textures.\nOne other cool side effect of photographing outdoors is that it can be pretty easy to work with your settings. Often your photos will turn out great in-camera and at a great quality, too (since you can easily lower your ISO on a bright day).\nThe Sun\nThere is only one main light source outdoors: the Sun. The sun lights up everything, and it is the reason why outdoor photos always turn out so well. Even when you can't see the sun directly, it is still there behind the clouds, providing an infinite source of light.\nOne thing to be careful about is that the sun isn't too bright. As we discussed in the \"Filters\" section, you can always put on a UV filter to protect your camera from the elements.\nLight Sources: Light Box\nWhen you can't take a photo outdoors, you should use a light box. A light box diffuses the light entering the box, allowing you to take a pristine photo of a product without any hard shadows.\nIn the photo above, I was able to get a really great shot of a camera with even lighting throughout, which would have been pretty hard to achieve in any other location.\nBuilding A Light Box\nStep 1: Crate\nStep 2: Adding Backdrop\n\n\nStart off by getting a large crate. Crates are great for making light boxes because they are sturdy, just the right size, and have holes which flashlights (and other lamps) can fit in.\n\nTilt the crate on its side. Attach a poster board to the inside of the crate using tape. Lightly bend the poster board at the seam so no crease is visible. This will be the backdrop for your photos.\nStep 3: Adding Flashlights Step 4: Finish!\n\n\nUse tissues to diffuse flashlights, as described under \"Light Sources: Indoors: Flashlights.\" Then take the flashlights and put them in the holes of the crate, facing inwards.\n\nYou have finished making a quick and simple light box! These are great for taking clean, bright photos. You can even take these light boxes outdoors to get more light in the photo.\nI generally use my light box setup and a tripod to take photos of products. In my opinion, it works way better than any other place indoors and consistently provides a clean place to photograph, regardless of time of day.\nLight Sources: Indoors\nYou don't necessarily need a light box to take good photos indoors. The photos above were just taken on a table in a room with good lighting.\nHere are some other ways you can get the light you need anytime you are indoors.\nWindows\nWindows are perfect diffusers. They always seem to let in the perfect amount of light, not too dark or too bright. Windows can also be very interesting points in a photo, bridging the gap between the indoors and the outdoors.\nArtificial Lighting\nUsing lamps and other sources of artificial lighting can really help set a mood in your photo. They are also very convenient, since you don't have to build your photos around a single window, but you can rather take a photo anywhere where there is a lightbulb nearby.\nKeep in mind that most artificial lighting has either a warm or a cool temperature that you need to know about. We will talk about this in depth in the \"Color\" section.\nFlashlights\nMost people try using flashlights as a light source initially. After trying them out for a while, you will most likely end up being unsatisfied because they result in very bright highlights and very dark shadows.\nTry attaching a tissue to the end of a flashlight using a rubber band. This will result in a much more even lighting, similar to the ambiance of the sun.\nReflected Light\nIn the photo above, light bounced off of the reflective black surface. This was a great source of light, since I didn't want any of the lighting to be too harsh. The light also resulted in a cool reflection below the desk.\nYou can also use a store-bought or homemade reflector like a mirror, to reflect light in the direction you want it to go.\nMaking A Reflector\nStep 1: Folder\nStep 2: Cutting Folder\n\n\nI made my reflector using a manila folder. This makes it easy to store (simply fold it in half) and helps you control how you reflect the light.\n\nI cut off the edges of the folder to make it a rectangle. This makes it easier to fit your reflector inside a camera bag.\nStep 3: Adding Aluminum Foil Step 4: Finish!\n\n\nI then cut aluminum foil to the right size and taped it inside the folder, with the shiny side facing out. You can also use glue for a more permanent solution. Try to avoid too many creases in the foil.\n\nYou are now done with your reflector! You can use this reflector to better achieve a proper front / back lighting balance, both indoors and outdoors. The above is an image of the reflector in use.\nReflectors are a great way of regulating light, regardless of your location. Many photographers use store-bought reflectors for portrait photography in order to better light up a person's face, without having to point a million lamps at them.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLH/CZD5/JNIQKLYA/FLHCZD5JNIQKLYA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Lighting"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "As we learned in the previous step, there are many different sources of lighting - however, not all of them are equal. Depending on the environment you are in, the brightness of your photos will vary.\nHowever, there is something you can do about this without compromising photo quality. Our eyes can adjust to different levels of lighting, and a camera is no different. You can fine tune exposure (or how bright a photo turns out) by adjusting three settings: shutter speed, aperture size, and ISO. We represent this visually using the exposure triangle.\nThe Exposure Triangle\nThe 3 sides of the triangle are shutter speed, aperture, and ISO, as shown above. These are what they mean:\n1) Shutter speed refers to how long the shutter is open for. The longer the shutter is open, the more light over time enters the sensor. However, too long shutter speeds often result in blur, either from the movement of the object you are photographing or from the movement of your camera itself.\n2) Aperture size refers to how much the aperture opens. The wider it is, the more light enters at a time. If your aperture is too wide, however, you will find you have a very shallow depth of field. Depth of field refers to how blurred an object is when it is at a different depth (distance from your camera) than something that is in focus. A shallow depth of field often results in a blurred background or foreground.\n3) ISO refers to how sensitive the sensor is to light. If the sensor is more sensitive, it takes less light before your photo will be well exposed. The disadvantage is that the higher the ISO, the grainier your photo will turn out.\nYou should learn to vary each of these 3 settings according to the environment you are in. If you are taking a photo of a fast-moving subject, use a higher shutter speed. If you are taking a photo of a landscape, where everything should be in focus, use a smaller aperture. If you are taking a photo and can't afford to compromise shutter speed or aperture size, increase the ISO.\nMost cameras also have a light meter. This light meter refers to how exposed a photo will be when you take it. For a DSLR, if you press down the shutter button halfway, your camera will update the light meter. You should aim to be right in the middle, at 0, for proper exposure. Anything over 0 will be overexposed, and anything under 0 will be underexposed.\nBad Exposure Management\nThe photo to the left is an example of bad exposure management. This photo was taken in the late afternoon, but that still doesn't explain how dark the photo is. I had very low ISO and a high shutter speed, which negatively affected how bright it looked.\nThe photo to the right has been overexposed. This is because I had adjusted the settings for a scene facing the ground, and when I took a photo with the sky in the background the sky turned out too bright.\nGood Exposure Management\nThe photo to the left is an example showing how exposure doesn't determine how well a photo turns out. I had to use a high shutter speed to capture the rain, but I also like how dark and dramatic the photo looks.\nThe photo to the right was slightly overexposed, but it just adds to the effect. The overexposed background just contrasts the subject better.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FEL/G4GQ/JNSR8QT9/FELG4GQJNSR8QT9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Exposure"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Color is how our eyes perceive light, and it is essential in almost every photo. Color helps make subjects stand out, can introduce tension, set a mood, and a whole lot more.\nAs such, it is essential you learn the basics of the color wheel. You don't need to memorize any rules or color schemes, but it helps to at least know about them.\nThe Color Wheel\nThe most basic photography color wheel can be broken down into 12 slices, as shown above. The color wheel is meant to help people decide which colors work best with others. More specifically, the colors you use in relation to each other can determine the mood of the photo and how other people react to it. I would group these into 2 main categories: similar color schemes and contrasting color schemes.\nSimilar Color Schemes\nThese color groups work whenever you want colors to mesh into each other / fit in with each other. Images with similar colors often feel very calm and relaxed. Similar colors are great at setting a mood or tone. There are 3 main ways to include similar color schemes in your photo:\nName Description Example\nThis is the simplest color scheme, where a single color (and its shades) are featured prominently. Black and white photos are a great example of a monochromatic scene.\nPick two or three adjacent colors and feature them in your photo for an analogous color scheme. These work when a monochromatic color scheme simply won't work because you don't have enough colors to play with.\nChoose two colors that are spaced out by one color in the middle. This color scheme results in a slight amount of contrast due to the color you skipped, but don't contrast so much as complementary colors.\nContrasting Color Schemes\nWhen you want certain elements of your photo to stick out, you need to use contrasting colors. Contrasting colors are great when you have more than one subject or when your subject has multiple parts that you want the viewer to notice. There are 5 main ways to include contrasting color schemes in your photo:\nName Description Example\nUse two colors that are opposite each other for a complementary color scheme. This works so well because the colors contrast sufficiently without sticking out too much.\nInstead of picking two opposite colors, we are going to choose a color pair (specifically a diadic color scheme) opposite the main color. For example, in the photo to the right there are red buildings contrasting with green trees and blue water.\nAll you have to do is choose three colors that are evenly spaced out on the color wheel, and you will have a traidic color scheme. This is great for when you have multiple subjects and you want them to stand out individually.\nThis color scheme involves picking four colors that are evenly spaced out. Use these to convey mood by showing the viewer a very vibrant and vivid scene.\nSelect two opposite diadic pairs for a more subtle color scheme that still contrasts nicely. In the photo to the right, I created tension by sandwiching one diadic pair (blue and green) between another (purple and red).\n\nWarm and Cool Colors\nWarm colors are colors like red, orange, and yellow. Cool colors are colors like green, blue, and violet. Warm colors are always more prominent, or dominant, than cool colors. The way I like to remember this is that a flame (warm) will always melt an ice cube (cool).\nYou can use this to your advantage by having cooler colors around the subject and warmer colors for the subject. This also helps accentuate your depth of field, since the warm colors seem to pop forward and the cool colors seem to fade backward.\nNotice how in the photo to the left, the leaves don't really stick out against the blue background. The branches almost fade into the sky. However, in the middle photo and right photo, the bold, warm colors practically leap forward. The colors stand out sharply against the cooler background.\nWhite Balance\nSomething seems wrong about the leftmost photo. The colors just look unrealistic and strange, and they look very warm. The photo to the right looks strange too - the greens stray way too much towards blue and the pinks look purple, making the photo very cool. However, the photo in the middle looks natural. Why is this?\nPhotos naturally have a temperature. This temperature refers to how hot or cold (orange or blue) a photo is. Our cameras naturally try to counteract too much temperature through a process called white balance. Even if a photo doesn't contain any white, it can be painfully obvious when things aren't balanced right, such as in the first two photos above.\nLuckily, our cameras can come to the rescue. Here are the most common presets your camera will have for white balance:\nName Description\nAuto\nIn this mode your camera will attempt to figure things out for you. Whenever there are many cool or warm things in your photo, your camera might not be able to differentiate these from white, so it might get things wrong. For example, in a photo where the sky is prominent, the camera might try to go for a warmer white balance to \"counteract\" the cool sky.\nTungsten\nThis setting is for shooting indoors under tungsten lighting (warm lighting). Your camera will counteract this by cooling down the photo slightly.\nFluorescent\nThis mode is for shooting indoors under fluorescent lighting (cooler lighting). Your camera will warm the photo slightly to counteract this.\nDaylight\nThis mode is fairly normal, which is used when taking photos outdoors. I turn it on when I don't want auto white balance to disrupt things, especially when I know I don't need much white balance.\nCloudy\nThis mode is for when there are many clouds about. It warms up your photos to counteract the absence of sunlight (since the sun is likely behind the clouds).\nFlash\nThis mode helps the camera adjust to low light conditions, especially when using flash (which is very cool) by warming up the photo.\nShade\nThis mode will warm up your photo when there are lots of shadows around, since shadows tend to be dark blues, rather than dark oranges.\nManual\nThis mode allows you to choose your white balance. This is great when photographing very warm or very cool things that might confuse your camera. It also allows you to tailor the white balance to your surroundings.\nBut really, auto white balance is great. You can always go back in and change the temperature slightly in post-processing if needed.\nManipulating Temperature Using RAW\nIf you are taking your photos in RAW (and even otherwise, to an extent), you can also easily manipulate temperature in post processing, so you shouldn't get too hung up on getting it perfect initially. Keeping your camera on auto white balance is more than enough for a beginner to get acquainted with their camera, since you will get good practice tweaking temperature using software.\nWhen I was trying to take a good photo for the \"Filters\" step, one of the worst shots I got was the photo to the left. For some reason, my camera thought it was perfectly fine to make everything heavily tinted blue. However, it wasn't too much for Adobe\u00ae Photoshop\u00ae software to handle, and soon I was able to get the image on the right.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6B/ZK15/JNM84ZN4/F6BZK15JNM84ZN4.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Color"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Most people talk about how you are supposed to take photos so they look good. I completely agree with this, but I also think that where you take them can be almost as important.\nMost people just whip out their cameras and take a shot wherever they need to. However, investing some time in finding a good location (when viable, of course) can be the difference between good and perfect.\nFind A Clean Area To Use\nFirst things first - remove EVERYTHING that isn't intended to be in your shot. Make sure that there isn't any visible clutter (especially with product photography) and avoid things in the foreground that are in front of the subject. This doesn't mean that your photos have to be perfectly clean, just that if they aren't make sure it is intentional.\nIn the example above, the photo to the left is extremely cluttered. The one to the right is a lot less cluttered. I also used some photo editing to clean up the shot and accentuate the pumpkin.\nYou can also get a clean photo of the same location by waiting. This is especially true of tourist spots, where there will be swarms by day and few by night.\nFind The Right Background\nNot only should you find a background that looks nice, you should find one that makes sense for your product. For example, a computer probably won't look good perched precariously on a tree branch, but a bird feeder would look great in the same environment. The pumpkin photo in the previous part was still a bad photo, for a Halloween pumpkin has no business being on a granite counter-top.\nIn the photos above, the photo to the left demonstrates an example of a bad background. The metal the planter is on just doesn't go well with it, and the holes you see throughout just distract the viewer. Finally, this desk was located in an area without good lighting, so I had to use flash, which messed up the texture of the planter.\nThe photo to the right is a really good photo. The castle planter is in a location that makes sense (on a desk, since it is a paperweight, next to a window, since it is a planter and needs sunlight) and the environment doesn't distract from the subject.\nFind A Wide, Open Space\nThis part is two-fold. First of all, make sure the entire subject is visible. This is especially important in product photography, where you essentially have to sell someone on a product in a handful of images. How many times have you been intrigued by an Instructable but didn't take the time to read it because of a terrible cover image?\nThe second part of this is that you have to be taking your photo in the right location. Trying to take a photo of a car in a small garage won't work out. Taking a photo of one on a driveway or in a parking lot will work a lot better, and if you take a picture of a car on an open road, you pretty much can't go wrong.\nThis also ties into clutter. The key word of this section is open spaces - you need to give your subject room so the audience isn't distracted by other things in the shot.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDC/05BS/JNIQKOR9/FDC05BSJNIQKOR9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Location"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "You've set up your shot perfectly; you've chosen a good location, you've accounted for lighting, and you've even taken the time to work out the settings. But when you snap a shot, it looks terrible. Dark, deep shadows fill the scene and nothing looks right.\nYou most likely have a problem with timing. Timing refers to when you take your photo. Often, if you don't like how your photo turned out, you can come back at a later time of day (or even later in the year!) to take it again.\nTiming by The Sun\nIt matters when you take your photo. Obviously a photo in the dead of night will look a lot worse than a photo at golden hour. There are several different \"slots\" of time to know:\nGolden hour refers to the hour after the sun rises and the hour before it sets, when the sky is filled with all sorts of oranges and yellows and reds. Golden hour results in very beautiful photos, since the sun isn't harsh enough yet to create any deep shadows. It also happens to be when a lot of wildlife are out and about.\nBlue hour is the hour before the sun rises and the hour after it sets. This is very similar to gold hour, except instead of a golden tone to your photo, you will have a more bluish tone.\nAfternoon is an okay time to photograph things. While some people can pull off afternoon photos phenomenally, it can be quite hard to counteract hard shadows and bright highlights. For example, in the photo to the left, the grass is a lot brighter than it would be normally because the sun is directly overhead. I could lower the exposure, but then there would be darker splotches of grass instead.\nNight is also a generally a very hard time to photograph most things. You are going to have to mess with exposures a lot, and you will most likely have to use flash or another lighting source. For example, in the photo to the right, it is very hard to see the grass because of how dark it is.\nThat being said, a lot of night photos are simply stunning. Since there is so little light entering the camera, you can also lower your shutter speed to capture the motion of the stars, among other things.\nTiming by Motion\nWhen there are moving elements in your photo, timing is key. Often if you wait a split second too long, the moment will be gone and your hard work will be lost. This is why people spend days in a blind - they are waiting for that perfect moment when an animal crosses in front of them.\nIn the above photo, the only reason I was able to get a good shot of the squirrel was because I took the shot right as he had climbed up to that section of the branch. Seconds after I released the shutter, he was darting from branch to branch, soon far out of sight.\nTiming by Season\nWhen you start introducing seasons into the mix, things get tough. You can take good photos regardless of season, so most people never really think about it much. Plus, you don't want to have to plan, say, vacations around your photography schedule.\nSeason helps set the mood for your photo. The weather conditions are different, the animals out and about are different, and even people act differently.\nFor example, in the photo to the left, it looks like it was taken sometime in winter. The trees have a darker green tint, and the sky is more overcast. In the photo to the right, the sky is far more blue, the trees are fuller, thicker, and greener, and even the castle structure looks better.\nBoth of the photos are technically good photos, but one is clearly better than the other.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FT3/3PCP/JNIQKM6U/FT33PCPJNIQKM6U.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 10: Timing"}, {"step": 11, "steps_text": "Composition refers to how you take your photograph. Photographers use composition to distinguish their photo from everyone else's shot, especially when they are in a location commonly visited and photographed. It is how, even when taken at the same exact location, photos can look so different from each other.\nComposition \"rules\" are very loose. Often people break them on purpose (or on accident!) for a perfectly acceptable reason. This also means that sometimes rules directly contradict each other. Pick and choose which ones you want to apply and which ones you don't.\nRule of Thirds\nThe most common composition rule is the rule of thirds - it basically says the prominent parts of your photograph should be along the lines of a 3x3 grid, namely at the intersection of the lines.\nBlur\nOne of my favorite styles of composition is blurring the background and/or foreground. Blur tells people that a particular part of your photo isn't important, so the audience will naturally be drawn to the crystal clear, in focus subject. In this image, the face of the lizard is razor sharp and the tail blurred. In this context the blur also serves as an artistic effect, showing how similar the reptile's skin and the tree look.\nLeading Lines\nLeading lines are more subtle - they are included in the photograph and guide the viewers to where you want them to look. If you take a photo of a tall building, the viewer's eyes will naturally be drawn up along the sides (which narrow to a point), emphasizing the height and prominence of the building, such as in the photo above. The sides of the tower draw the reader's eyes up to the top.\nPerspective\nThe perspective from which you take your photo also matters. Getting down low makes your subject larger than life, important, powerful, and prominent. Looking down on something diminishes the subject. Taking a photo at eye level results in a more personal shot, like you are looking through the photographer's eyes at the subject.\nFor example, the photo to the left shows a view looking down at the castle. This shows it as a quaint little planter, a small little trinket you might put on your desk. The middle photo shows the castle head on, showing a more personal outlook. The photo on the right shows the castle from lower down, transforming it from a planter into a huge, towering castle.\nContrast\nGenerally speaking, every photo should have some shadows and some highlights. Otherwise everything ends up looking very bland. The amount of shadows and highlights you have in your photo affects contrast, which is when your subject stands out against the background and the rest of the photo.\nIn the photo above, not only do the lizard and the tree contrast against the white background, the sharpness of the lizard contrasts with the blur of the tree.\nSpace\nYou can tell a lot about something by the space surrounding a subject. It can even define the scene by providing a foundation that the subject builds upon. For example, in the photo to the left the tall tower is surrounded by a beautiful white (or rather, blue) space that shows how much it stands out against the environment it is in.\nIn the image to the right, the chess pieces have white space above them. This also relates to our rule of contrast - the white background helps the chess pieces stick out.\nFraming\nFraming shows depth and also implies setting, similar to space. in the photo above, it isn't immediately obvious what the scene is of. The small amount of wall to the left shows that this shot was taken inside facing outwards and helps the reader realize that this is a picture of a balcony.\nColor\nAnother way to make your subject stand out is to make it a different color (or more colorful in general) than the rest of the image. In the above photo, see how the photo is filled with dull greens and grays, and the red of the car draws immediate attention to it.\nAlso notice how, even though it is a lot more subtle, the yellow of the tractor stands out in the background. I did this on purpose. I thought the main car looked very old and vintage, so I wanted to take a photo that would show how out of place it looks by including the tractor.\nTexture\nTexture refers to how the surface of something looks. Examples of various textures include rough, grainy, smooth, etc. Textures help add depth and meaning to a photo. You will often see a lot of texture in black and white photography, for the removal of color forces the viewer to focus on the texture of an image.\nIn the above photo, there are a lot of different textures. This texture helps transform what would be an ordinary image into a beautiful composition.\nSymmetry\nSymmetry results in very strong compositions. It occurs when something is mirrored across the center, either left / right or top / bottom. It also breaks the rule of threes, because the subject is generally in the center. However, this is okay - not all of these \"rules\" have to be followed.\nPattern\nPatterns can add a lot to a photo. Patterns can come in many forms, from repeating elements (such as the wood planks in the photo to the left or the bricks in the photo to the right) to fancy swirls to patterns in nature.\nHumans are naturally drawn to things such as symmetry and pattern. You can use this to your advantage by including it, or \"break\" a pattern to create tension, such as how in the photo to the right the brick pattern is interrupted by windows and the roof.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCU/LM4O/JNIQKLZ3/FCULM4OJNIQKLZ3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 11: Composition"}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "Used with permission from Microsoft. | Adobe product screenshot(s) reprinted with permission from Adobe.\nPost processing is something every photographer needs to learn. No, post processing isn't cheating - it simply allows one to gain a firmer control over their photos.\nThe two big names people always think of when they are editing photos are Adobe\u00ae Photoshop\u00ae software and Adobe\u00ae Lightroom\u00ae software. These softwares are incredibly sophisticated and have pretty much every tool you could want when editing photos.\nFor those who don't want to invest money in a good software, Microsoft Photos software is a surprisingly advanced photo editing software for Windows. It has all of the necessary tools to turn good photos into great ones without the learning curve or cost of other applications.\nCropping\nUsed with permission from Microsoft.\nCropping is probably the most used form of post processing. It is something everyone with a computer knows how to do. It is used mainly to cut out extraneous details and change the subject of the image when necessary\nStraightening\nUsed with permission from Microsoft.\nStraightening can be used when you accidentally took a photo at a slight angle and want to correct it in post-processing. You can rotate a photo and crop it to make it a rectangle again very easily - Microsoft Photos software will automatically do this using the straighten tool.\nExposure\nYou can also of course make slight changes to exposure, white balance, highlights, shadows, contrast, and other brightness related issues after taking a photo. A lot of photographers will take photos normally and then mess with the exposure later so they gain more control over the process.\nI generally increase brightness and mess with shadows / highlights so they look closer to what the scene looks like in real life. I also try to leave contrast alone, so the image doesn't look overly dark or overly light.\nSaturation\nSaturation is how much the colors of a photo pop. I almost never like to increase saturation, as resulting images look like a hot rainbow mess. People will be able to tell if your photo is unrealistic, so be careful! You might even want to consider reducing saturation to set a mood. When you take out all of the colors from a photo for black and white photography, the audience pays more attention to texture, mood, contrast, and other important elements. Use Photoshop and other specialized programs to control how your image is converted to black and white - high contrast, silvery grays, etc.\nTemperature\nTemperature relates to how warm or cold something looks - a room with cold, whitewashed walls will look more intimidating than a warm, luxurious room that invites you to unload your troubles around a fireplace. This helps set the mood of your scene.\nTemperature is also related to white balance. White balance refers to trying to get your photos to look as natural as possible by adjusting how the camera processes the image in different lighting conditions - certain environments take on a bluish tone, and others take on a orangish tone, so the camera learns to compensate. While temperature can help with abstract shots, realism requires the strictest adherence to reality. You can tweak temperature in post processing to help achieve white balance if you don't do so upfront.\nSepia\nSepia is a form of monochromatic photography. Similarly to how black and white photography only uses shades of gray, sepia only uses shades of brown. The difference is that black and white looks like something from the past, whereas sepia looks like it was taken in the past. I generally convert to sepia by first converting to black and white, and then converting to sepia, as seen above.\nVignettes\nVignettes used to be a problem with cameras, where the center of the sensor received more light than the edges. After a while, this started being considered an effect rather than a problem, and now many people add vignettes to their photos in post-processing. The photo to the left doesn't have a vignette, and the photo to the right does. The purpose of a vignette is to draw the reader into the photo, as subtly shown above.\nYou can also apply a white vignette to give your photos a more dreamy look, or to add a unique element to your image. The photo to the left looks much harsher than the photo to the right, which has a white vignette.\nDon't go overboard with vignettes, but a light one can go a long way to improving your photos.\nSelective Blur\nYou can apply a surrounding blur for similar purposes as a vignette - blur helps draw people towards the subject.\nThe purpose of selective blur is that you can take crystal clear images and add blur in later.The idea is that if your initial image is blurred, you can only sharpen it up to a point, but if it is very sharp throughout, you can blur it in post processing as much (or as little) as you want.\nI generally try to simply use wider apertures to get blur instead, since it generally looks more realistic. However, this might not be possible depending on the camera you have.\nNotice how in the image to the left, the tree is very sharp. This is a problem - a viewer will naturally start moving their eyes left because of the blurred background to the right, and we don't want them to skip over the butterflies. In the photo to the right, the tree is slightly blurred, so the viewer knows exactly where to look.\nRAW File Editing\nRaw files are necessary for good photography. What normally happens is the camera you own processes the information it receives from the sensors and exports them as a JPEG. But if you export as a RAW file, the camera will store all of the data it receives.\nYou can then use software to process these RAW files. The above photo to the left is the original file, and the above photo to the right is the edited file. Just to show you how powerful RAW is, I changed the color of the leaves from green to yellowish-orange. I was able to lighten most of the branches to show texture, which would normally be very hard if I had saved it as a JPEG.\nAdobe\u00ae Photoshop\u00ae software offers my favorite selection of RAW processing. It lets you do pretty much all of the other post-processing techniques discussed above almost instantly, with no learning curve.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOD/Z4C9/JNIQKOL3/FODZ4C9JNIQKOL3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0X/1HY4/JN4VEJ9A/F0X1HY4JN4VEJ9A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY2/C256/JN4VEJ99/FY2C256JN4VEJ99.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 12: Post-Processing"}, {"step": 13, "steps_text": "Up until this point, the information I've given you is about how to take the perfect photo, taking into account gear, timing, lighting conditions, composition rules, etc. This is rarely possible in real life, so every photographer worth their salt has to at least be able to sort out the bad photos from the good ones. Luckily for you, most of this stuff is pretty easy and builds on the previous information.\nPurpose\nWhat are you taking photos for? If you plan on printing out your photos, they need to be of very high quality and technically perfect, as any blemishes will be enlarged. This is especially true if you want to print your photos on a canvas - Prints should have at least 300 ppi (pixels per inch) in order to be of high enough quality.\nIf you are using your photos for the web, you can get away with lower quality photos, since web is only 72 ppi.\nThis is important because it means a photo on your blog doesn't have to be as high quality as a photo you would put on your mantelpiece. This should in turn affect how picky you are with yourself when narrowing down your photos. Sure, you can sharpen your images in post-processing, but often this sharpening won't hold up once you print it.\nAnother thing you need to keep in mind is what kind of photography you are taking. Landscape photography, for example, needs to\nNarrow It Down\nInstantly discard any photos which are very blurry or very grainy. I often take a good mix of shots, so usually when I do have a blurry photo, I also have another that isn't. If you only have a couple of photos that didn't turn out too well, I would recommend not using them at all. For example, the photo to the left is pretty much useless because of how heavily it is blurred.\nTake out any photos which have bad exposure to an extent that they are not able to be fixed. Often photos which are way too dark or way too bright can't be fixed, simply because they don't have enough contrast to make a photo or because if you brighten them or darken, them they will have grain. The photo in the middle doesn't have that bad exposure, but because of the combination of light and dark background, it would take longer than just retaking the photo.\nEliminate any photos which don't adequately show the subject. This means that if the subject is really far away or so close you can't see it well, the photo likely won't turn out well. Note that this has varying meanings depending on your purpose - macro photos should be really close up, while city skyline photos should be really far away. For example, the photo to the right is a perfectly fine photo, but it is a little too far away to really show off the building.\nSelect The Best\nOften the \"best\" photo simply comes down to selecting the one which was closest to your vision. A dark, moody photo won't look good as a cover image for your Instructable. A beautiful landscape would look perfect on the cover of a magazine. A photo that is bright and cheery, rather like a stock photo, would do just fine on a blog.\nI also look at which photos that purposely follow or break the rules of composition. This means that you didn't just stumble upon it by accident. Maybe you intended to break the rule of symmetry to create tension, or you used color to make your subject stand out. Whatever the case, you didn't take a photo your way because it was the easiest way; you did it to convey meaning and purpose.\nUsing Your Photos\nIt's time to enjoy your hard work. Now that you have great photos, you can use them. Here are some of the fun things you can do with your photos:\n1) Print them out - You can print photos for a variety of purposes. You can make a photo album to store all of your good memories. You can print a photo out on a large canvas and hang it somewhere. You could even put your photo on a greeting card and send it to your friends.\n2) Use them on the web - This is the easiest and most common way of using photos. For example, I used a lot of photos as demonstration in this Instructable. You could also put your photos on your own website or blog if you have one. A lot of photographers get well-known simply by frequently posting photos on social media.\n3) Sell them - This one might seem a bit cheap at first - photography should be a passion, not a business! However, selling your photos can result in extra cash, which you can put to use buying new gear or saving up for a large photography trip. Plus, if people use your photos, it can help spread the word about your talent and looks great on a resume.\nThe most common ways of selling photos are by selling the license or by selling the rights to use that photo. However, lots of people also sell canvas prints of their photos or sell products with their photos on them (such as t-shirts or hats).\n4) Enter contests - This method is a lot of fun. If you don't win, it isn't a big deal, since you didn't lose anything. If you do win, you get accolades, awards, and even money (or other great prizes). The main thing I would be careful of is to make sure that the contest you are entering doesn't require you to give them a license. Often these are scams to help the owners of the contest get lots of free photos.\nI would also suggest not paying to enter contests unless you are sure you have an absolutely outstanding photo. Since often only a handful of people actually win, everyone else will end up paying a lot of money and won't see any gain.\nLong-Term Storage\nI don't delete many of the photos I take. I can almost always find a use for a photo later on, and if I delete it, I can't ever get it back. What I prefer to do is, every so often, move all of my photos from my SD cards to a heavy-duty storage drive. This helps me keep all of my photos in one place, so I don't have to keep track of a million SD cards.\nI then move all of the photos I really like and put them in another folder. This way I don't have to comb through thousands of photos just to find one I like, but I don't have to get rid of those thousands of other photos, either.\nI also try to keep a copy of every photo before and after post-processing, just in case I ever change my mind about how I've processed it. For example, if I convert a photo to black and white, I won't ever be able to convert it back to color without investing some serious time (and even then it wouldn't turn out that well).\nI would also suggest having a backup (or several backups!) of your main storage unit, preferably in different locations. This way you don't lose all of your photos if the drive gets corrupted or destroyed.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLA/5W5W/JNOVOROL/FLA5W5WJNOVOROL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 13: Reviewing Your Photos"}, {"step": 14, "steps_text": "What's Next?\nSo what to do now? Information about photography is endless, and I've worked incredibly hard to include the things I felt were important for a beginner's guide. It would be pointless to try to cram too much into one Instructable, so instead I'll just leave you with some next steps to take.\n1) Research - Some topics I would suggest researching now that you know the basics are more advanced photography techniques (bokeh, HDR, zoom burst, etc.) and photography disciplines (portrait photography, street photography, long exposure photography, etc.) Google should be your best friend in your pursuit of knowledge, as there are thousands of people who have taken the time to share their photography knowledge with the world.\n2) Discover - Take a look at other people's photographs. Don't feel like you have to reinvent the wheel every time you take a photo - learn from other people's successes and failures and use it to improve your own photography. Eventually you will start to develop your own style.\n3) Practice - One of the most important things about starting photography is to just get out there and do it.

For white, get a big 500ml tub as it's the most commonly used colour.\nSomething to pour paint over\nGesso (optional)\nYou can buy cheap box canvases (a wooden square/rectangle with canvas stretched over it) or you can use bits of wood. If you use wood you'll need to get Gesso. It's like undercoat, but a bit rougher. Hell, try cheap undercoat, it might work. Box canvases come pre-primed with Gesso.\nplastic cups (various sizes)\nlollipop sticks\nlatex gloves (optional)\nplastic sheet (for minimising mess - optional)\nYou'll mix paint in the plastic cups, and stir it with the lollipop sticks. Buy different sizes of cups such as 7 or 8oz and even some little shot cups. You'll need over half of an 8oz cup to cover about an A4 sized canvas. Gloves are for sissies. Get your hands dirty dammit!\ntreadmill silicone\nSilicone is the secret ingredient that makes the paint go all funky. You only need about 3 drops of this in some cups to give that cell look to paintings. You need to get 100% silicone. Some cheap dollar/pound shops do 3-in-1 or WD40, but most aren't 100% silicone.

Your pumpkin will likely be 2-3 inches thick, and you can scrape away most of that - the more you scrape from the inside, the brighter the design will be when lit.

These lenses are basically larger format lenses with built-in adapters that allow you to pan, tilt and lock in your arrangement. The adaptor mechanism pushes the lens away from the camera a couple inches, making larger lenses mostly necessary.\nWhich sensor size lens is for me? Let's start with your camera which may be one of the 3 fairly common sensor sizes (small to big): APS-C, Full Frame and Medium Format. This project will work with any, you'll just need to buy a lens that is meant for at least the next size up. So, if you're using a APS-C camera, using a lens meant for a Full Frame camera should work well, if you're on a Full Frame like me, you'll want a Medium Format lens and so forth.\nWhich focal length should I get? This really depends on what you are shooting. If you're doing architecture or enjoy really wide shots, I'd suggest getting a 24mm or 35mm. If you're looking to shoot portraits or lifestyle, maybe a 50mm or 85mm.\nWhat's this crop factor I hear about? One thing to know is that stepping up to the next sensor sized lens will come with around a 1.6ish crop. So, If you're using an APS-C camera and you buy a full frame lens at 50mm, it will actually act like an 85mm-ish. A 24mm will act like a 35mm-ish and so forth.\nIs this guy an idiot?
