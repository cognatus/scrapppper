If you'd like to go that route, skip to the next step.\n3d modeling is a long and complicated process that I won't get too in depth with here, but I will share with you a few tips and tricks that apply to this project in particular.\nBefore actually diving into the model, step back and think about how exactly you are going to break it up for 3d printing. I try to reduce the amount of seams by using natural lines in the object itself. Another consideration is the color of each area. I typically have different colored parts separate, to make the painting and finishing process easier. The size of the parts varies based on the bed size of your 3d printer. I have Prusa MK2Ss so I typically keep parts under 8\", slightly less if they are interlocking.\nMy 3d modeling software of choice is Autodesk Fusion 360. It's free for hobbyists and has several different workspaces that allow for different types of modeling styles. The folks over at Autodesk have a bunch of great tutorials to help you get started.\nMy usual workflow is as follows:\n1. Setting up the canvas(es)\n2. General massing of parts\n3. Details and more details\n4. Internals (Channels for LEDs/Wiring/Electronics, this could be combined with step 5 depending)\n5. Splitting the parts for 3d printing / creating snap joints and/or pins (I usually do a new \"save as\" of my model before this step for archiving purposes)\n6.

I'm not going to explain the 3d printing process as every printer is different, but here is an overview on 3d printing with transparent filaments.\nThe parts that are backlit with LEDs were printed with a transparent \"natural\" colored PETG. Natural, undyed PETG (or PLA) is a light, transparent color, similar to clear acrylic that has been frosted (sanded). When layered, this is great for diffusing LEDs.\nThere are several considerations to keep in mind when printing with transparent filament. It can be sanded but no filler can be used. Since light is being diffused by it, the printed parts need to be solid, with no infill grids/honeycomb showing (printed at 100% or 0% infill). To get the smoothest surface possible on the side that is seen, I printed the teeth in half, with the exterior face down on the bed. When a printer is adjusted properly, the first layer of a print should mimic the smoothness of the printer surface. This made the exterior of the teeth smooth with no print lines. I printed these at a 150 micron (.15mm) layer height but you could do less if you want a smoother edge.\nPETG can be tricky to print with and requires a full metal nozzle and heated bed due to the higher print temperatures required. It is prone to warping if conditions aren't optimal and I usually print slightly slower as well to make sure it adheres to both the bed and itself appropriately. Transparent PLA is an easier option, but I prefer the look of transparent PETG. Either works, use what works best for you (and your printer)!\nThere are 11 \"teeth\" with spacers that make up the \"blade\" portion of the Bladesaw. These were all printed in halves, for a total of 22 pieces printed with \"natural\" (transparent) PETG. I did several tests (the final one is the first picture) and ended up with a 1/8 inch (3.18 mm) shell. They were printed at 100% infill and while still hefty, 1/8\" was the sweet spot.\nThe orange parts were printed with a transparent orange PETG and were printed solid. These didn't actually have LEDs behind them but when the light hits it, they appear have a slight glow to them.\nThe rest of the parts were printed in silver PLA, using both Hatchbox and Inland filament, on two Prusa i3 MK2S 3d printers.\nOther methods considered for the teeth were vacuum forming and clear resin casting, but were both expensive and time consuming methods.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXP/JYJ3/JQGYDOTI/FXPJYJ3JQGYDOTI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPG/ZWG3/JQGYDP3B/FPGZWG3JQGYDP3B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7K/2R35/JQGYDOU4/F7K2R35JQGYDOU4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBW/D3W2/JQGYDOVG/FBWD3W2JQGYDOVG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEV/FLEC/JQGYDOTU/FEVFLECJQGYDOTU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCS/QII0/JQGYDOUM/FCSQII0JQGYDOUM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: 3d Printing (with Transparent Filament)"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Now that you've got some parts 3d printed, it's time to move on to the step I like to refer to as: Eat. Sleep. Sand Repeat.\nMy previous Instructable Noctis' Engine Blade goes in depth on this process. I want to teach additional techniques with these Instructables, not repeat myself. Check that out for details, but here is an outline of the process I typically use:\n1. Initial prep work (gluing certain parts together, cleaning dust off of the surface)\n2. Filler primer (and/or Spot Filler Putty, depending on your preference)\n3. Wet sanding (see step 4 of my previous instructable for the breakdown, I like to use a tub as picture above)\n4. More filler primer (and/or \"spot filler putty\")\n5. More wet sanding\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until smooth (increasing grit as you go, I usually start with 220 and move up to 400)\n7. Primer (matte black primer, compatible with plastics)\n8. One last wet sanding at a higher grit (I usually do 800, unless it's a gloss finish, then go higher)\n9. Another layer of matte or gloss black primer\nAlright, still with me? You may be thinking \"Brian, that's a lot of work, isn't there a quicker or easier way to get smooth 3d printer parts!?!\"\nIn short, no. You can make it easier on yourself by printing parts at a higher resolution (100 or 50 microns if you have the time) and that may reduce the amount of filler you need. Cleaning up 3d printed parts time time and effort. If you don't want layer lines to show, you need to put in the time and elbow grease. There are other methods and materials, such as XTC-3D, wood filler, etc, but you will still need to do a ton of sanding, and I've had mixed results with those anyway.\nTake this step with a grain of salt and find what works for you.\nDisclaimer: I have a spray booth that vents outside of my shop and I still use a rated respirator and eye protection when using spray paint and airbrushes.

Sleep. Sand. Repeat)"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "This step is always one of my favorites. Here is where we see the prop come to life with color and texture!\nFor the Ancient Bladesaw I used two techniques for getting the final finishes: \"dry-brushing\" and textured spray paint.\nDry-brushing is painting with a \"dry\" paint brush. If you haven't used the technique before that probably sounds ridiculous. It can be achieved using various paints and in multiple applications (such as weathering) but for this project I used it to get a worn metallic finish on the gold and silver pieces. I used Hard Body Acrylic paints by Liquitex. Rich Gold/Silver is your main paint, with the corresponding bright gold/silver as a highlight. If you want to give additional accents and highlights, mix a tiny amount of blue or red into the bright gold/silver to give it a slight color variation. Each of these steps takes practice to find the right balance. Practice this process on a scrap piece first to get the technique down.\nHow to dry-brush:\nWhen starting this process, your part should be primed with either a glossy black primer or a matte black primer depending on what level of shine you are going for. I used a matte black because I wanted a worn, dull finish.\nI like to use a piece of cardboard as a palette. Squeeze out a thin line of paint. Gently dab a little bit of paint on the tip of your paintbrush.\nLightly dab your paintbrush on the palette until there's only a light amount of paint left on the paintbrush.\nSince this isn't dry-brushing for weathering but as a top coat, use long, light brush strokes over the surface, barely touching it, but enough so there is contact. This process takes a while, but will give you a nice brushed metal look. This will take a few passes since you are using minimal paint. Be patient, don't get frustrated or start using too much paint. The end result is worth it.\nFor the bulk of the body, the Ancient Bladesaw appears to have an \"earthy\" and \"wood-like\" appearance. I'm told that it's actually stone or pottery based on a Japanese style of pottery known as Jomon. To achieve this look I did a few different test methods, eventually settling on Rustoleum Multicolor Textured spray paint in \"Autumn Brown.\" I've used this technique on grips for a handgun to make it look like \"wood\" and it's an easy way to cover a large surface quickly.\nLike dry-brushing, this process starts with a black primer. I used matte black primer for this.\nSpray a coat of the multi-color textured spray paint on your part. Be careful not to over do it, this paint goes on very thick. It may look like a weird oatmeal at first but will dry as an even coat. Don't panic, let it dry fully before moving to the next step.\nThe textured paint isn't as dark as I wanted, so I did a light wet sanding with 400 grit. Be careful not to overdo it or you'll take off too much paint. Be gentle with the sanding, you just want to lightly scuff the surface.\nAfter your part has dried off it's time to do a light color wash. If you aren't familiar with a \"color wash\" here's a quick rundown. A color wash is a quick and easy way to weather your props. I used a black color wash to darken the overall top coat. Time for a step by step inside of a step. It's \"learnception.\"\nA color wash uses standard acrylic paints, such as Liquitex basics or the off brand equivalent. You're going to be mixing this heavily with water, so it doesn't need to be expensive paint. If this is your first time, pick out a brown (such as burnt umber) and a black (ivory black). Little plastic paint mixing cups are also handy for this process. If you're at the craft store anyway, pick a few of those up.\nIf you want to take this a step further, pick up the standard primary colors (red/yellow/blue). They are usually named \"primary red/yellow/blue.\" I don't know a lot about color theory, but I do know if you mix those three together, it makes brown. Test out different ratios to get different hues of brown. Think about where your prop would have been and what color dirt would be there.\nNow that you have your paint ready, put a little in your plastic cup. Put approximately the same ratio of water in the cup as paint. Mix them together! The ratio to paint varies depending on how dirty you want to make your prop. Since this is mixed with water, it will flow into crevices and nooks, naturally weathering it.\nLike I've mentioned before, practice this on a test piece before actually doing it to your finished prop. I like to use a paint brush to dab a little of the mixture from the cup onto to the prop. Use a paper towel (I use blue shop paper towels for this) to lightly smear and wipe up the mixture. If you let the paint set for a minute or two, more will be left behind. Think of this like intentionally smearing grime onto your prop. Using various color mixtures will give it more layers of grime but be careful not to overdo it. Odds are your prop wasn't laying in a swamp for 20 years (unless it's from Fallout, then maybe it was).\nI keep a pile of latex gloves from Harbor Freight handy at all times. The paint you're using for this is acrylic so it washes off easily, but I wear gloves anyway.\nApply several washes to get the color your heart desires. For this project I didn't actually do any weathering since the top coats were weathered, but both dry-brushing and color washes can be used to do surface weathering.\nAt this point let's assume you're done with your top coat. Congrats! Before you pop that Champagne (or sparkling cider) don't forget to clear coat your parts. You can clear coat now or after full assembly, that's up to you. I use Liquitex spray varnish or Rust-oleum clear coats. Matte, semi-gloss, or gloss are your choices, depending on what you want the final prop to look like. The clear coat seals in your weathering and gives it a protective layer.\nI've ruined many a paint job in my day, here's a few tips and tricks to avoid having to sand off your top coat and start from primer.\nPractice on scraps. I sound like a broken record but seriously, practice first. Test your paints in layers before applying them to a final part, from primer to final coat.\nAlways use a primer appropriate for the type of material you're painting. Read the labels. A primer is designed to adhere to specific surfaces and creates a binding layer between the paint and the part. For 3d printed parts use a primer compatible with plastic.\nWarm paint sprays better. If you're using spray paint, fill a small container with \"warm\" water and let the can of spray paint sit in the warm water for a few minutes.\nDo light passes. More coats are better than spraying paint too heavy and having to sand off a bad coat. Be patient.\nIf you use spray paint, get one of these. Your hands will thank you.\nWear a respirator and only use spray paint in a well ventilated area. I have a spray booth that I built for around $100 that vents outside of my shop, I highly recommend going that route if you have room. I'll do an Instructable documenting that process next.\nDon't be afraid to try out different paints, textures, and techniques.

Take it with a grain of salt and experiment with them!\nThe battery we are going to use for this is a 3.7v Lithium Ion battery, but the Neopixels and the Trinket run off 5 volt. Brian that math doesn't add up. Nope, it sure doesn't. This is where the POWERBOOST 500C (PB500C) comes in. The battery connects to that board and it converts the battery output to 5.2v, which is then connected to the Trinket. Huzzah! Now we're cooking with coconut oil.\nAlright, so now that we kind of understand what's going on, let's start soldering things together. If you are rusty or don't have a lot of experience soldering, practice on a breadboard first. I like using red for positive/5v, black for negative/ground, and green for data lines. That keeps things nice and neat. 22AWG wire works great for this. (Wire gauge is backwards, the bigger the number, the smaller the wire). Refer to my chart above for the wiring diagram.\nSolder the positive and negative on the PB500C to the positive and negative on the Trinket (reverse side).\nSolder wires to the GND (ground) and 5V to the powerboost. Solder the corresponding wires to the LED strip.\nSolder a green wire to the data (\"din\" center pin) on the LED strip. Attach this to the 6 pin on the Trinket.\nIf you want to use a switch to turn the power on and off, solder the center pin of the switch to the EN pin on the PB500C and bottom pin of the switch to the GND pin (right below the EN pin).\nPlug in your battery to the PB500C.\nWait. Nothing happened?! Don't worry, you haven't programmed the code yet for the Neopixels. This is normal.\nI am not experienced enough with this next section to try to explain it to you. Arduino code is a foreign language to me and I am still learning. I will defer to the below resources on the setup process of the software and code required. Feel free to leave any questions below and I will do my best to point you in the right direction!\nAdditional resources:\nKamui cosplay has a wonderful ebook with an introduction to Neopixels. Buy her books.\nAdafruit has an awesome \"Uberguide\" to Neopixels\nTweaking4All.com has a great guide to different Arduino codes for Neopixels. This is what I used to learn how to adapt codes for different effects.\nA few quick tips for dealing with Neopixels\nTake your time. This isn't a quick process. If you aren't willing to be patient, use standard 12V LED strips, it will cause far less of a headache and heartbreak for you.\nPractice soldering before actually soldering onto the boards / LEDs. Buy a breadboard and practice your solder points. Invest in a decent soldering iron with a nice tip. Tin the tip before use.\nWhile learning to use the arduino code, an Arduino Uno is quicker to test code on. Use a test strip of LEDs to test your code.\nUse heat shrink to cover the connections of the LED strips. It's a quick and easy way to make sure everything stays nice and neat.

At this point I had two halves of the main body, one with the LED strip and teeth attached to it at, and one without the teeth.\nI've been working on getting snap tolerances as close as possible and this was a stress test of those skills. Luckily every groove fit together and I heard the satisfying click of the pins locking together.\nAn important note about snap fitting joints: when painting, either mask the joints (they aren't going to be seen anyway) or take care to avoid getting paint in/on them. I had to go back and sand paint off several areas to get pieces to fit together. The tolerances I mentioned early do not account for paint, only the shrinkage of the filament. You could add a little extra wiggle room but that's hard to gauge.\nThe parts making up the halves themselves were glued together but the two separate halves are held together by the pins, no glue.

Yes, 1845 is completely the wrong era for English pirates, but it's still the cutlass everyone knows from movies and storybook illustrations. You can see this in the screenshots I took from one of my favourite movies, the 1990 version of Treasure Island (probably the best pirate movie ever made...) As far as I'm concerned this makes it the quintessential literary pirate cutlass.\nUnfortunately, originals are very expensive and no one makes a replica, at least not available in Britain, so I decided to make my own. But I don't have the chops to make my own blade so I decided to borrow the blade from a different sword. Katanas are about the right shape and are readily available (although the government is clamping down on them again this year *fume*) so I bought the cheapest one I could find, \u00a350 delivered.\nA katana blade is quite long, and the handle is much too long for a cutlass, so I cut the end off the tang with a hacksaw and further used a file to eat into the blade by a further two inches or so. This brought the actual blade length down to 25 inches which looks right to me. Because it was a cheap katana the cutting edge is not hardened, so it was easy to file.\nTo remove the hamon (the milky pattern along the cutting edge) I dipped it into a strong solution of potassium permanganate for about eight minutes. You can buy this very cheaply online because it is used for etching circuit boards. I used half a litre in a bit of PCV pipe. The blade turned completely black (and got very hot during the etching process!) but after sanding the oxide off with some wet and dry paper I was left with a pleasing antique-looking finish, and no hamon.", "title": "Turn a Katana Into a Cutlass", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Turn-a-Katana-Into-a-Cutlass/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The hilt began as a piece of 1.5mm thick steel. The piece I used was nickel plated because that's what I had, but it would have been better to use plain steel since the nickel coating messed with my blackeneing method (see later). I made a cardboard template and used it to cut out the shape with a hacksaw and file. I also drilled and filed out a hole for the tang to fit through.\nTo create the bowl or cup shape I used a piece of timber (a bit of fence post actually) and gouged a shallow depression into it. Placing the steel over the depression and gently hammering it with a ball-end hammer quickly caused it to curl up and take shape -in fact I was surpsied how easy this was! I also hammered the edges of the hilt over a piece of steel bar so they fold in the reverse direction, which strengthens the thin part of the hilt (in retrospect it would be easier to do this part first while the steel is still flat). Once I was happy with the shape and size I made another hole in the thin end of the hilt for the peg on the end of the tang to fit into (if this doesn't make sense see later for how it is all constructed).\nI then filed and sanded out most of the hammer marks (at least on the outside of the hilt) which also removed the nickel coating (or so I thought).\nApparently Naval cutlasses were painted black. However, I'm somewhat skeptical that they used regular paint back then, so I used an alternative traditional method of blackening with boiled linseed oil. The process is simple: clean the steel thoroughly with wire wool and acetone to remove any grease. Then heat the reverse side of the metal with a blowlamp and paint the linseed oil (use boiled, not raw linseed oil) on the other side. When it gets hot enough the oil will start to smoke and 'bake' on. Repeat this a couple of times and you will be left with a durable black coating that looks just like black satin paint! I did get trouble with traces of the nickel flaking off as it heated up, leaving un-blackened patches. Fortunately this is only visible on the inside of the hilt and rust may hide it later, but I learned my lesson: use only plain steel!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FC5/9LSX/JS0ORQX4/FC59LSXJS0ORQX4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F81/U4OJ/JS0OV3CQ/F81U4OJJS0OV3CQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTJ/LO5L/JS0OV3EI/FTJLO5LJS0OV3EI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F50/GPIA/JS0OV3H0/F50GPIAJS0OV3H0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3R/GP4O/JS0OV3IS/F3RGP4OJS0OV3IS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Making the Hilt"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The handle I made from a piece of scrap beechwood, but any wood would work.

This helps to absorb any shock to the handle during the peening process, and also compresses to fill any gap between the handle and hilt.\nI also made a brass washer thing to fit above the hilt to hide the less-than-perfect hole where the tang slides into the hilt, plus it's a cool detail.\nFinally I made a peening block. This is a piece of thick (4mm) steel that slips over the peg on the end of the tang, which allows you to hammer or 'peen' the peg over without hammering all over the nicely-made hilt. A subtle detail is that the hole in the peening block should be filed at an angle; this means the peened metal will mushroom over and form a wedge which cannot come loose (you can see what I mean in the next step).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTW/DXHP/JS0OV3AY/FTWDXHPJS0OV3AY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXM/9X33/JS0OV3MC/FXM9X33JS0OV3MC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ6/PTKV/JS0OV3KK/FZ6PTKVJS0OV3KK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Making the Handle and Peening Block"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I assembled the component parts, stood the sword on a block of wood and proceeded to peen the peg with a ball-end hammer.

Yuo have to make sure that the glue you're using isn't elastic, because you don't want your prop to bend in the middle of a ComicCon, while everyone is admiring your Halo Master Chief laser gun or something as embarrasing as this. You should also read the glue's instructions properly to make sure that the glue you're using isn't toxic. If necessary, wear a safety respirator.\nOnce your prop has its final shape, you should cover i t with a fine layer of body filler. This body filler can be in form of spray or brush Paint. You can use an specific for 3D printed pieces body filler, like XTC-3D; or you can use some buolding body filler you can find in any hardware store. You have to make sure that the body filler isn't very dense, and that it can be applied into the type of plastic you prop is made.\nAfter the body filler is dry, you have to sand all the piece using some sandpaper. A 200 roughness sandpaper will be a good one to start sanding your piece. After the sanding, you should cover the prop with other layer of body filler, and sand it again with a lower roughness sandpaper. You will need to repeat this steps until your prop is as smooth as you want.\nOnce you are fine with the prop's aspect, go to the next step.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPT/QC3R/JSL38MU8/FPTQC3RJSL38MU8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEE/B805/JSL38MV3/FEEB805JSL38MV3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7J/U8BT/JSL38N7Y/F7JU8BTJSL38N7Y.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: First Step: Preparing Your Prop"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "If you are reading this, is because you've just completed the tedious process os priming and sanding your prop.

If you are not happy with your plain and sad creation, continue reading. Here is were the magic that gives life to your creations starts!!!\nLets start from the beginning. Normally, all the props have a different base color than bodyfiller's one, so its time to paint your piece. In this point you should make a decission. If you want your prop to look like an old metal piece, wich has parts were the original paint has dissapeared revealling the silvered metal that was covering, you should jum to the \"Simulating old metal\" step. If you are not interested in giving your prop this aspect, I invite you to continue reading.\nIt's time to give your creation the first layer of color.

They are cheap and can be used to cover big surfaces in a short period of time. You can choose the color you prefer, and you can always look for external references to show to your nearest paint shop employee, and he Will help you choosing themost similar colour. Also, if your prop has the same color that the body filler you've used, I recommend you covering the prop with a layer of that colour spaypaint, because its easier to apply different types of paint over a sparypaintlayer than over an industrial body filler.\nYou should always remember that, if you are using spraypaints, you have to work in a ventilated \u00e1rea, being aware of not painting food or things you are going to put in contact with your body. You should also wear a respirator and safety glases.

This is the step whre you shou show to the world your painting abilities, or at least look for someone who isn't as horrble as you while having a paintbrush on its hands.\nWhen you are applying a second colour to a prop, you don't want the parts that you've alrady painted to get covered by tha new colour. First of all, you should cover the parts you don't want to be repainted with masking tape. If the \u00e1reas to cover are very big, you can also use paper towels and glue them to the prop with masking tape in the borders and difficult areas. This could become a very tedious part, but I can grant you that, the more patient you have covering all the details, the better the final result will be. Having said that, I can't give you more detailed advice of wich part should be covered, because every prop is different. The only thing I can say you is to be patient and prepare to have a good time olaying with scissors, paper towels and masking tape.\nOnce you've covered all the parts you dont want to be painted, you can apply the second layer of Paint. In this step, I suggest you to use acrylic Paint. It's easier to apply using a paintbrush, and you can mix different colours to get the exact colour you are looking for. If after one colour you want to apply another one different, you should repeat the masking process again. You can repeat this as many times as you want.\nWhen your prop has the colours you want, it's the most magic moment during all the process: removing the masking tape. While you remove the masking tape carefully, the colours and details of your prop will become visible, and your prop will come to life. At this point, you should apply a layer of transparent varnish to your prop, to avoid it to be damaged in the future.\nAt this point, your prop is finished and you should be very proud of it.

But there's always the world of make-believe, and what better way to get in the ocean vibe than with an amazing deep sea diver costume. I created this costume pattern to try and recreate the feel of the classic \"Mark V\" dive helmet which has become an iconic image of divers and the sea. It was used by the U.S. Navy from 1916 until 1984! Let's make one of our own.\nHere are the tools and materials I used:\nPattern: I used the one that I created. You can find it on my website. It includes an adult and a child size.\n5-8 mm thick EVA foam: I used the foam from an anti-fatigue floor mat, but you can also use the less dense foam from a camping mat.\n2 mm EVA craft foam: One sheet is enough\nVinyl tubing: 3/8\" outside diameter\nWingnut: 1\nSuper Glue\nHot Glue Gun: I love my glue gun because it is adjustable temperature. I like to use it at as low a temp as possible so that the glue cools quickly.\n6 & 8 mm leather punch\nCutting Surface\nGluing Surface: I absolutely love using a silicone baking sheet. Nothing sticks to it.\nSharp Knife: If it is not really sharp you will have a terrible time when you are cutting the foam. I like to use a scalpel.\nBlowdryer: Used for heating the foam so it can be shaped.\nBallpoint Pen\nScissors\nPaint: I used Liquitex Basics \"Mars Black\", Liquitex Basics \"Bronze\" and DecoArt Americana Decor Metallics \u201cVintage Brass\u201d\nRubber Gloves\nPlease note, the above links are affiliate links, and I do get a small commission if you buy through these links.

There are some people that say there isn't enough formamide in EVA mats to be harmful, and others that say there is. Do your research and come to your own conclusions. At the least, I would say it is a good idea to open your foam mat up and let it sit in the sun for a day or two, as most of the chemical will off-gas from the foam. Or buy foam that is labelled formamide free.\nDo not wear your helmet until all fumes from glue and foam are gone. The helmet is a fairly enclosed environment and you only have one set of lungs.\nDo not block off the viewports with glass or plastic. These are open to allow proper airflow for breathing.

This technique may save you some time and money when creating your next masterpiece, and is very useful for projects that need to look perfect and clean, which is a look that is not easy to obtain and maintain in cosplay. I am currently working on Samus' Gravity Suit from Metroid Prime (pictured above), which has a very flawless and toy-like appearance. To achieve this, I chose vinyl over paint.\nMaterials:\nCar vinyl\nHeat gun or hair dryer\nScissors\nPen\nEVA/craft foam (also can be used on Worbla and other materials)\nContact cement (preferably the scent-free LePage brand)\nPainters tape (not required, but useful)\nHow to acquire vinyl:\nThere are many sources for obtaining car vinyl. You will buy it by the roll. Pay attention to the size of the roll - if you have extra large pieces, some rolls will be too small. You can get it from Amazon, but I have had a lot of luck shopping for vinyl through Wish.com. It takes longer to get it, but it is cheaper and I have found a larger variety of colours and sheens through Wish and you can get discounts using their codes. You can also purchase vinyl with cool patterns on it and vinyl that is translucent for lighting work or colouring transparent plastic/glass. The vinyl I get from Wish is about $10-15 for a 1.5m roll. The costume I am working on now is a full armour set plus an arm cannon/blaster, which took up about 7 rolls. Some of the vinyl I have used is pictured above.\nWhy use vinyl?\nConsider that the arm cannon took 1 roll to cover. The standard way to colour a prop would be to prime it and paint it with spray paint. One piece may take an entire can to cover, plus time to cover it. It may also start to peel or crack over time. In Canada, each can of Flexi-Dip and paint costs about $10/ea for results not as flush, so the savings start adding up with this strategy. You also don't need to work outside, so working in the winter is easy!\nLet's begin!", "title": "Cosplay That Looks Like Metal or Plastic!", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Cosplay-That-Looks-Like-Metal-or-Plastic/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Cut the pieces you need for your costume from EVA foam.\nPlace your piece on the back of the vinyl with the wrong\nside facing up and trace around it. Add at least 1cm of space around it so that the piece can be wrapped.\nCut out the vinyl where you made your lines.\nPeel the backing off of the vinyl.\nPlace your foam on the vinyl with the wrong side up. Make sure your foam is free of debris. You can use the painters tape to remove any lint or hair that is stuck to it. The vinyl picks up these details, so clean pieces mean clean results.\nPress down on the foam to stick it to the vinyl.\nFlip over the piece and use your heat gun on low or your hair dryer to warm up the vinyl. Press down on the piece to help the vinyl stick. Heated vinyl sticks better.\nIf you are working with a curved piece, you will need to heat the vinyl and stretch it over your piece. You can watch videos on YouTube showing how people put vinyl on curves of cars in shops.\nFlip over your piece to the back. Cut darts if there are curves in your piece or if your flat piece will be bent (this will aid in buckling/unwanted folds).\nUsing the heat gun/hair dryer again, heat the vinyl until it becomes a little softer and fold the pieces around the back of the foam. Tip: to keep darts on rounded edges from becoming rough and jagged, use your hand in a curved shape to fold the pieces inward at the same time instead of individually.

What I do to attach the pieces together is create a foam base. I cover the base and the back of my pieces in contact cement and stick them down. Easy! Note that if you do this, you will want to slightly expand the size of your vinyl-covered pieces as the foam base will cause the outside to become larger. The difference between this technique and painting is you are essentially colouring the pieces and then attaching them to a base rather than attaching and then painting. See first photo above for covering the back in foam to cover edges. The next photo shows cutting darts on a flat side as I had to curve the piece. The last photo shows a few completed pieces.\nYou can also attach your vinyl-covered pieces to other kinds of fabric using contact cement as well.\nIf you do not wish to attach the pieces to anything, I recommend covering the backs with something to help prevent the vinyl from peeling up. Adding contact cement or another glue should work fine. I don't recommend using hot glue as it will melt the vinyl.\nIf you want double-sided pieces, you can either leave out the seam allowance for wrapping and attach it directly on both sides, or put two covered sides together.\nVinyl connects very well to itself. You can easily wrap other objects with vinyl as well!\nYou can use translucent vinyl in a similar way. If you want to cover a clear item to make it coloured, you can purchase vinyl meant for headlights and use a squeegee or other softer flat surface to smooth it out after heating. You don't need to wrap this kind of vinyl if it is on a perfectly smooth surface. This is how I coloured the light-up section of my glove and the shin armour blue and the gun section orange (transparent Worbla is underneath).\nLIFE-CHANGING TIPS!\nAfter some time, your vinyl may start to form bubbles or pop up of the foam. Foam is soft and vinyl sticks best to very smooth surfaces. To prevent this from happening, you can cover your foam in one thin layer of contact cement. Once dry, it sticks very well to the vinyl. This is perfect for pieces that have been sanded. Sanded and dusty pieces will not stick to the vinyl. With one coat of cement, it works perfectly!\nWhat did I recommend painters tape for? Well, if you are building something with multiple parts that need to go side-by-side perfectly (see photos above), you can use the tape to attack the pieces together on the front first, then flip it over, add the glue, and then attack it to your backing. Contact cement is super strong and once something is connected, it is almost impossible to get it off again. This prevents any misplaced/off-center pieces from being placed.\nLet me know if you have any questions in the comments.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FF5/L6YQ/JRQOIF2S/FF5L6YQJRQOIF2S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0X/GH15/JRQOIF2X/F0XGH15JRQOIF2X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F01/9YYL/JRQOIF2W/F019YYLJRQOIF2W.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Tips for Covering and Finishing"}], "channel": ""}, {"category": "", "description": "Can you imagine having a wardrobe of personalised top hats?

The brim needs to be a close approximation to the shape and size of your head. You can make it a bit larger and line it with a beanie to make this a little less critical! The shaping of the brim will be a little trial and error to get right.\n1. Set the top part of the hat down on the heavier cardboard and trace loosely around the outside of it. I pressed in a bit to give me a bit of leeway when shaping.\n2. Cut the hole out then set it on your head. Use a pencil to mark areas that need to be trimmed and trim until you are satisfied with the fit. Again you need it to be slightly bigger than a prefect fit as the top fits inside it. The photos show the brim before where it does not sit properly on the head, and where i marked it to take more cardboard out. The second set of photos on the head show the cardboard fitting loosely in the place I want the hat to sit.\n3. Decide on the width of the brim and use a compass or another bit of card like I did to measure out the outer edge of your brim. Cut.\n4. Trace the brim piece onto a second bit of cardboard and using the compass or bit of cardboard trace the inner circle again - this piece will be the top of the hat.\n5. Cut the top out, then cut in from the outer edge to just inside the inner ring (too big and you wont be able to get the brim over), making sections you can fold down and use to attach the piece to the hat. Cut out every second section to make it easy to attach.\n6. Bend and glue each of the folded sections then fit the hat over the top. Firmly press each section into the hat and tape to hold while the glue dries. Its doesnt matter if the top is not perfectly flush as we will papermache it to finish it!\n7. Once dry, set the hat top down on the table and slide the brim over the top and down to the sectioned edge. Make sure it is the same as the top - front at the front. Turn the hat back over then glue the sections onto the brim.

I actually took on way more than I should have by creating most of the characters in the production. I have over 33 years in multimedia and design and always wanted to get into this profession since I was young seeing the creepy animatronic figures at the \"Hall of Presidents\" at Walt Disney World. I am slowly building my skills over the years and hopefully this Instructable will help you attain your goals and/or passion for fabricating as well.\nNot knowing where to start learning how to fabricate a puppet, I found many Instructables (a special shout out to RickGyver) that helped using cardboard as the structure and more. Having said that, I wouldn't recommend using cardboard for puppet designs. But Zazu seems to be holding up 2 plus years later. A fabrication of this nature can be time consuming (especially with the feathers!), but it is very rewarding in the end seeing the children's faces perform with them and seeing your work come to life in front of an audience. I took several photos during this build, but many intermediate photos are missing because I didn't realize I would be writing a tutorial one day. I will do my best to illustrate what was done in the fabrication process. I also didn't make Zazu have a mouth mechanism to simulate talking. I didn't have enough time to build (not hard to build), but I did regret not making it. Here's a great place to learn.

Could you imagine being there?\nAs a side note, please excuse the poor photo's; older cell phone technology.\nSketch, Trace, and Cut\nAfter I sketched all of my Zazu images, I thought it would be fun to create a clay maquette (a sculptor\u2019s small preliminary model or sketch). I wanted to create the body smaller so that the actor could easily hold it while the head was relatively the same size as the Broadway play version. Not a final maquette, but it was good practice in figuring out a form before spending too much time in fabrication.\nHaving said that, on a piece of paper or on your computer, sketch out Zazu\u2019s head. I use Adobe Illustrator to create my artwork. I always sketch out my ideas first so as not to waste any time on needless lines in the program and to understand my general direction. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t own the software or anything comparable. Sketching works just as good! I like to keep a digital copy of my work AND to be able to print out the templates with clean lines if I want to revisit the build (see PDF templates below).\nThe following PDF templates can be downloaded for use for this project. Please note that some (if not most) templates may need to be retrofitted to work with your design/build. Many templates were built after-the-fact, so an exact measurement may be needed before cutting. There are times where there won\u2019t be a template and you will need to fabricate based off an image. By this time you should be proficient in working with cardboard and making your own templates. Also, for legal purposes, please do not sell any of these templates. They are for educational-purposes only. Download all templates in one PDF below.\n1. Head/Beak/Jaw (A-Side)\n2. Head/Beak/Jaw (B-Side)\n3. Beak (top view)\n4. Beak (inside structure)\n5.

I just want to put this out there because I was using a high temp glue gun towards the end of the build and burned my fingers pretty badly. Especially watch out for the glue when you are working with fabric. I found if I put too much glue on at a time and tried wrapping it around the puppet it would snap back on my hand (almost like it was magnetic) and burn my hand. I sound like a fool telling you this, but if I can keep anyone from burning themselves like I did, then I will be happy.\nPrint out the template(s) and trace the lines using tracing paper with a fine tip black marker. Or, from your own research sketch out Zazu\u2019s profile onto tracing paper or directly onto the cardboard. The outer structure of the head (A-Side and B-Side) shown above are instructions on where to place the template objects. The PDF template for the head, beak, and jaw are found in the previous step \"Preparation and Templates\".\nTIP: To soften the cardboard before working with it, drag the cardboard on the corner of a desk or wall. Drag forward and back. This will breakdown the structure inside the cardboard a little better and you can bend the templates into position. Note also that there will be a direction in which the cardboard was made (generally you can look at the side or note the lines in one direction). Try to bend according to the direction of the cardboard; makes life much easier!\nMethods for Tracing Templates\nOption A: Cut the template object out, tape, and trace onto a piece of cardboard. Then cut the cardboard out. I did this on larger pieces like the head so I made sure everything lined up correctly.\nOption B: Place the tracing paper on the cardboard and tape it. Then take an XACTO-knife or snap blade and cut through the line. Next, take a black marker and mark through the line onto the cardboard. Freehand drawing works just as well, but the templates would be useless at that point.\nOption C: Tape your cardboard onto a wall and use an overhead projector to trace the template. The problem here is you have to make sure you are designing to the correct size all of the time; meaning don\u2019t move the projector once it is set in place. Speaking from experience, this becomes a true nightmare!\nOnce you have all of the pieces traced or hand drawn, cut them all out and label. Labeling is the key to semi-quickly fabricating this character and maintaining order.\nHINT: If you know you will be building this puppet again, make sure if you have retrofitted a piece to fit, make a duplicate. It takes a little time, but you will be thanking yourself the next time you rebuild the puppet. If you have access to a program like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator, scan the new template into your computer, trace it, label it, and get rid of the old template.\nShown are the steps and images for fabricating the head with beak and jaw.\nStep 1 (image 1): Print templates out or make your own. Cut out the head/ beak and upper jaw.\nStep 2 (image 2): Cut out and glue in the inner structure to the head and beak, along with the upper jaw. Continue on the opposite side and repeat using the template provided.\nStep 3 (image 3): Glue in the insert of the beak on both sides and start adding the outer structure of the beak.\nStep 4 (image 4): Add the eye hole on both sides. (Note: in the previous images there was a structure near the eye hole. It is now taken out to make room for the eye structure. Add in another inside structure around the eye once done for stability.\nStep 5 (image 5): Place the Polystyrene ball in both eye sockets. See notes on hollowing out to make lighter in the section \u201cThe Eyes Have It\u201d.\nStep 6 (image 6): Front view of head and beak. The head will need to be fully fabricated because there is no template.\nStep 7 (image 7): Cut out the upper jaw template and add sides.\nStep 8 (image 8): Jaw in place. Make sure it is not glued to the head if you want it to move with your mouth mechanism (instructions not included).\nStep 9 (image 9): Add the neck. Template not provided. Curl up a piece of cardboard to form a neck.\nStep 10 (image 10): Inner and outer structure glued on.\nAttaching the Jaw\nIn order to connect the jaw to the head, if you are not making a mouth mechanism, do the following:\n1. Attach the jaw to the head using an elastic band.(see image 11)\n2. Cut two wide pieces or use several to attach the back of the jaw to the jowls on the head.

Working inside with Bondo\u00ae is not an option, the smell is horrible! I can say that because I have worked with the body filler since I was 16 years old and I still can\u2019t get used to the odor. Work in a garage or outside.\n2. Drying time is fast, just like plumbers epoxy so you need to make sure you know what you are building up and work quickly.\n3. Wear gloves and googles because the chemicals can irritate your skin and eyes.\n4. Work in small doses so as not to waste any filler due to drying out and hardening.\nWhen mixing the Bondo\u00ae to hardener ratio you may get it wrong many times before you figure out what works. A good hint is if it is too red, then there is too much hardener and if too light then there is not enough hardener/Bondo\u00ae ratio.

But that would be a totally different Instructable. Also of note, try to position the eyelids close to the same position on each side. You can tell if they are off if you look at him straight on. He will look like he had too many drinks if they are off.\nFabricating Eyes\nThere are many ways to create a static eye for this puppet. I used a polystyrene ball that you can get at any art store. In order to keep his head lighter, you will be cutting out a portion of the eye to use on each side. The other half is used for his eyebrows and upper lid. Follow the steps shown below as a profile of the polystyrene ball to create your own (See images above).\nGlue the main eye in place on the head.

In the paint stage, paint them a fudge brown color and dry brush with white to give it an aged look. (See images 1 - 3)\nFeather Work\nFeathering Zazu! The most time-consuming part of the build besides the beak. As I mentioned before, you could go the route of covering the puppet with faux fur or fleece fabric. However, if you want to be more adventurous and a little crazy, just kidding, you will be needing to cut out around 200-300 plus individual feathers. Doesn\u2019t sound like much until you actually start cutting them out. I\u2019ve given tips below to make your life a little easier. Have fun!\nCut the feathers for the larger part of the body in strips as shown in the image. This way you can lay a large strip down, tack it into place with hot glue and move to the next row. You will need to start from the back of the body and work your way forward in order to get the feathers to lie correctly. Same with the legs and neck; start from the bottom and work your way up. Make sure each layer is offset from the one before.\nImage 5: Add feathers to the back of Zazu\u2019s head and paint.\nImage 6: Reference an image of Zazu and sporadically paint the tips of the feathers as shown using orange and yellow paint.\nImage 7: This image shows you how to lay down the feathers in proper order so as to have a layered effect.\nBeak Divider\nGlue down some hemp twine or any other type of rope to divide the head from the beak. (See image 8)\nPaint Beak\nPaint the beak from red, to orange, to white in a sunburst style. It is easier if you have an airbrush, but I didn't at the time and was careful to lay down the red on the orange by the doing the following (see image 9):\n1. Paint the beak all white. Let it dry thoroughly.\n2. Tape off and paint the beak orange (3/4 of beak). Let it dry thoroughly.\n3. Last, spray paint the tip of the beak red. In order to get the nice fade from red to orange, paint the tip all red (1/4 of beak). Then fan out the red spray paint onto the orange to blend.\nMake the Tongue\nCreate a tongue for Zazu and paint it magenta. Use \u00bd\u201d to \u00bc\u201d craft foam and if you have access to a heat gun or even a hair dryer (takes longer) bend the tongue to form an \"S\". Hot glue into place. (See image 10)\nHead Feather\nYou can find a feather (artificial or real) in most art stores. Bend it at the bottom and hot glue onto the top of his head. (See image 11)\nAnkles\nTie some hemp twine around the ankles of Zazu and hot glue into place.

It is yet to happen to me, but it could, considering not every play has a props master to ensure care has been given to all props, sets, and costumes. If you are dealing with younger performers they have been known to throw their puppets during a show or rehearsal. I\u2019ve had to fix many of my puppets after-the-fact and once during. Here is a short checklist to ensure your puppets don\u2019t implode by the hands of others:\n1. Tighten every visible bolt and ensure to use washers were a nut can fall through (especially with something like cardboard). Use a locking washer so that the nut won\u2019t spin off the bolt. When the hardware is internal, you will be doing this same check before laying an outer structure on the puppet.\n2. Give a little pull on parts like arms, legs, and head to see if there is any give. You don\u2019t want to overbuild, as I mentioned before, but you also don\u2019t want an Exorcist scene being played out in front of the audience.\n3. If the puppet has hair, feathers, clothes, etc. make sure they are sewn or glued down in key spots.\n4. Does something rattle when you shake your puppet? If so, is it a game stopper and you have to take it apart to fix or is it something you can live with because a small internal part fell off and it won\u2019t affect the performance? Sometimes it is best to leave something alone and say, \u201cWhat noise?\u201d", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 11: Testing and Quality Checks"}, {"step": 12, "steps_text": "Lessons Learned:\nHere is the section I believe everyone should come up with after a big project. It will allow you to grow as an artist and help others to learn from your mistakes or accomplishments.\n1. Make it lightweight! Try to make your puppet or prop as light as possible because the actor you think should be performing with your creation isn\u2019t always what you had in mind. For example, Zazu was my first puppet build. I would watch videos and look at numerous images of the Broadway version of The Lion King, Zazu performer. The performer(s) are usually slight in build, 5\u20198\u201d and above, and are men. Who was casted for The Lion King Jr. role well after the fabrication commenced? A small build, 5\u20194\u201d girl. A small girl wasn\u2019t the issue. She wasn\u2019t able to hold the puppet for longer than a few minutes was the issue. As you know, Zazu is seen throughout the entire performance; thus he wasn\u2019t used as much and all of that hard work kind of went down the drain. So, the lesson learned: MAKE IT AS LIGHT AS POSSIBLE so any performer can use it, no matter their size, gender, or how long it is used throughout a performance.\n2. Give yourself enough time to fabricate. If possible, request ample enough time for you to build your props, create costumes, fabricate puppets and build the sets. The time you think it takes to fabricate, equals twice the time to build. This is true in most production and design work. Remember, this is supposed to be fun (I always have to tell myself that in the wee hours of the night and morning).\n3. Attend Technical (Tech) Week/ Day. This refers to the week prior to the opening night of the play, in which all of the technical elements (costumes, lights, sound, set and makeup) are present for the first time during a rehearsal. I did not know much about theatre when I started and I didn\u2019t realize how much I was needed there to help fit the costumes and characters to the performers. Not to mention I created the digital backdrops for the production and we had to have a light check the day of the play. No Bueno! If you can, be there for the days requested by the Director; it helps everyone in the end.\n4. Do not overbuild. Overbuilding a puppet or prop means to build it so strong that it is near impossible to fix if and when it breaks, and it will eventually break. Many of my first puppet builds, as you can see by the amount of hot glue I used in the images, are so tight that it is near impossible to pull apart. Build it well, but don\u2019t go to extremes that not even the apocalypse can destroy it. Give that honor to the cockroaches!\n5. Improvise. This is a big concept all fabricators learn early on. There won\u2019t always be a template, YouTube video, or online tutorial that will help explain how to do something. We all make it up as we go along for the most part. That\u2019s where the fun occurs, where the \u201clittle mistakes\u201d turn into better approaches to a solution. As Oscar Wilde put it, \u201cExperience is simply the name we give our mistakes.\u201d\n6. Clean up. I wished I learned this earlier on. By the end of my first project, I literally had cardboard half way up to my 6\u2019 frame and no one could walk in that area without biting it on the floor. Take the last 15 minutes of your day and clean up your workspace. Not only does it make your life easier when you start up the next time, but it is also a safety factor.\nWell, I hope you learned a lot, had fun in the process, and created a really cool Zazu for your production. Please share what you have made and if you have any questions, tips, war stories, or I missed a step somewhere, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to me.

Your character ideas change, kit is super expensive and, if you have no previous crafting experience, the idea of making your own gear can be absolutely daunting. This tutorial aims to provide the absolute beginner with a basic 'biscuit' shield that can be assembled in under an hour, and on a budget. It provides a blank canvas that can be filled with almost any character design, and also gives you a starting point to springboard into other shield shapes by using the same basic technique.\nThis shield design passes the basic safety requirements for all the LARPs I have access to, however it's important that you check with your own group's guidelines to make sure this fits with their safety requirements, and what size category it falls into. Modifications to ensure safety can be made to this design with minimal fuss. This particular shield is also ridiculously light, making it a practical option for younger players, highly active fighters, and players without the ability to maneuver heavier shields.\nMost of all, it gives you a fantastic starting point for diving into the world of making your own gear, whether you're a complete newbie, or a seasoned fighter, and a chance to truly personalise something to your own kit.

This size makes it the largest 'small' shield you can make within our group's rules.\n13x13mm K-flex pipe insulation. (http://www.kflex.com.au/kflex-australia/) This is the brand we use, however any similar pipe insulator will work. The important parts are the thickness of the foam walls, and the diameter of the center hole. We used 2 single-metre lengths for this project.\nGarden hose. You'll use 2m for this project. Make sure you buy it new as old hose is too brittle to use.\nEVA foam matting.\nCalico fabric. We bought a piece that was 1m long, by the width of the roll, which was about 1.2m. We specifically bought calico for this project because it'll give me a great base to paint on once it's sealed, and it's a pretty neutral color. You can realistically use almost any cotton fabric for this project, so long as it'll stand up to the rigours of fighting, and so long as it doesn't stretch. This is incredibly important. If you want something with colour, I suggest looking into broadcloth, drill cotton and cotton duck. I love the idea of someone out there running around with a Disney-princess-themed shield. If your fabric is too thin, you can follow the same instructions, but just double your fabric over when you go to wrap the shield.\nGaffer tape.\nCotton webbing, the same stuff that they use on canvas bags and some totes.

Kite and round shields work well for this technique, as do some other more adventurous designs that we've tried. I'll add pics at the end of the tutorial.\nWe cut this out quickly with a band saw, but a jigsaw, scroll saw or even a hand saw will work, so long as your edges are clean. If you've got a few gnarly bits, hit it with some 250grit sandpaper to take any splinters off.\nOnce your edges are safe to handle, you'll want to cut your hose to the length of your four sides. You want your hose to overlap at the corners, so just use the exact measurements of your shield.\nWhen you've cut them to length, take your craft knife and carefully cut along the length of the hose. The straighter the cut, the easier it will be to use, but don't fret too much if you go off-kilter slightly. The idea is to create a cut so that both sizes of the hose can be parted.\nTake your hose and, using the slit you just cut, fit it over the edge of your shield base as pictured. If your hose has been curled tightly, it might take a bit of coercion to get it to sit flat. Gratuitous use of gaffer tape can be employed at this point if it makes your life easier.\nFit your hose lengths over all sides of the shield blank, ensuring the corners overlap as pictured.

You'll need it.\nYour first step is to cut along the length of your K-flex, the same way we did to the hose. A pair of scissors is much better for this than a craft knife, but for the love of god, don't use the fabric scissors. I will hunt you down.\nOnce you have those bad boys sliced up, fit them over the hose. You're going to want to tape as you go, as this stuff is even less willing to stay where it's put. Pay careful attention to the corners, putting tape either side to secure it. You will end up with a small pucker at the edges. If you're a pedant like me, you can opt for cutting a small wedge (2cm or so) in the edge of the foam, but be frugal with your slicing. The corner padding is arguably the most important on a shield, so you really need to make sure you're not leaving anything exposed.\nIdeally, you'll match your corners up with the K-flex. If you have the luxury of doing this, overlap them like you did to the hose, but make sure you add a piece of tape lengthways so that it won't pull apart. If your K-flex needs to join on a straight or a curve, simply gaffer tape them down at the ends, and then add a bridging piece of tape to secure the two ends together. Just make sure there's no gaps between them. You can bunch some of the K-flex up if you need to, as it's quite malleable and it's better to have a little too much, rather than not enough.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIR/VHGY/JR0YPVI5/FIRVHGYJR0YPVI5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F21/P8WI/JR0YPVIT/F21P8WIJR0YPVIT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPS/MEST/JR0YPVK0/FPSMESTJR0YPVK0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL2/TY8X/JR0YPVKN/FL2TY8XJR0YPVKN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9Q/XOGD/JR0YPVLG/F9QXOGDJR0YPVLG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Step 2 - Foam Edging"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "As I mentioned earlier, we brought a metre of calico off the roll, and with this particular project, we have plenty to spare. Your biggest concern is ultimately making sure that you have at LEAST a handspan of fabric to fold over on all sizes of your shield. Depending on the size of your shield, this may be best done on the floor, but we were able to fit our project on the table.\nLay your fabric out. If you need to fold it over, now is the time. Lay your shield on top of your fabric.\nGrab the edge of your fabric and fold it over the shield, ensuring that you cover the edging entirely. You want it covered by a few centimetres at minimum. I generally go by rule of a thumbspan from the far edge of the foam, but that may change depending on the thickness of your edge. Mark where your shield sits on the fabric WITH the fold over.\nGo around and do this for all sides. If you're working with complex curves, err on the side of caution and go with more fabric than you immediately need. You'll be trimming it back later after we've secured it, and with the way fabric pulls, it's imperative that you have enough.\nYou must not leave any part of your foam exposed! This is super important for a few reasons.\nThe longevity of your shield depends on it. Fabric can be dragged along the ground. Foam can not.\nIt's a big-ass safety issue. Exposed foam will tear. Torn foam exposes hard surfaces. That's bad.\nThe fabric over your foam is what gives it the springy, rather than spongy quality, and ultimately holds it in place.\nCut that fabric up to size, and get out your staple gun for the next step.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3F/4S1U/JR0YPWFF/F3F4S1UJR0YPWFF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO8/FTGB/JR0YPWFT/FO8FTGBJR0YPWFT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3T/IGGP/JR0YPWHC/F3TIGGPJR0YPWHC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Step 3 - Sizing Your Fabric"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "This is where things get fun.\nPlacing your shield on the fabric so all sides can be covered, pick a starting point and begin stapling your fabric down. I always try to start with one of the largest surfaces, because it ensures that the fabric is stable while I'm doing the rest of the shield.\nWhen you're stapling, you simply want to fold the fabric over, nose the staple gun up against the foam, and plant your staple. I space my staples 4-5cm apart, and generally work from the corners, into the centre of the fabric, but go by feel for what works for you. Don't worry about making sure your fabric is tight for this first side. You want that staple as close to the foam as possible because it will secure your fabric better and, in the event that one of your staples pushes through the board for whatever reason, it will be on a part of the shield that is highly unlikely to have contact. Still, it's worth lifting your shield up to check that you're not having them protrude.\nYou may have a misfire where one of your staples isn't sitting right. Depending on the situation, either pull it out and put a new one in, or make judicious use of percussive maintenance (see: hit it with a hammer).\nWhen you've completed that first side, you're then going to go to the opposite side of your shield, and start there. At this point, you're going to want to gently tug on the fabric so that it's lying flat against the table/surface you're working on, rather than wrinkled or gathered underneath. Working out the tension of your fabric can be a little tricksy, so I've included a photo of how I pick it.\nWhat you're looking for is, when pulled across the foam, the fabric making a taut bridge between the foam and the wood. Not so taught that you can't push your finger into it, but definitely not floppy. It should have gentle give to it, as we're going to use the other side of the shield to add proper tension If you over-tighten it now, you're going to have a very uncomfortable shield later. Don't let go, simply push your staple gun into the fabric, butt it against the foam, and fire.\nIf you've ever stretched a canvas before, this is a very, very gentle version of that. What you'll notice is that, in the areas between your staples, you will have fabric pulling.

For the most part, you're going to follow the same instructions - pick a side, gently fold it over, go to the opposite and add a little tension - but you're eventually going to have to face these pointy bastards.\nYour first step is to make sure the foam insulation is tucked in. Pull your fabric over it like you would with the straight sides, but you may need to give the foam a poke inside gently to get it to sit right. Ultimately, it doesn't need to (and very likely won't) sit flat, but it's also not a big deal.\nWhat I like to do is to bring the staples right up on both sides to the very corner, and then fold my fabric over, almost like I'm wrapping a Christmas present. So, pull it across three-quarters of the way, fold it under, and then tuck it down. Lock it in place with one or two good staples. Rinse and repeat for all your corners.\nIf you're working with a more complex design, I follow my curves until I hit the corners, and save them for last. Get all your near-straight edges done first, and then focus on folding your fabric neatly, and stapling it into the corner.\nSo at this point, you should have a pretty well stapled shield back, with lots of fabric to spare, especially around your corners. You have two options:\nGet the scissors (yes, the fabric ones are okay this time) and trim the excess down so that there's roughly a 2cm lip of fabric around the edge. At this point, you can either leave it as it is, and your fabric shouldn't really fray, or you can go an extra step for finishing and use any extra webbing you bought to staple over the raw edges. It'll purely be a cosmetic difference, but that might be your jam.\nIf you're a bit of a masochist, you can fold that fabric under itself a few times, and then staple it down to get a really clean finished look, but the corners will be a nightmare.\nCongrats!

What you might find is that you actually need to use more staples on the front than you do on the back, just to get nice and unpuckered fabric edges. Go with what looks good. Your main goal at this point is to simply get a flush surface for painting on, and to hold that foam in place. When you're done with that first side, give your foam edging a squeeze and see how the feeling has changed from really soft and spongy, to quite bouncy under the fabric. That's what we're aiming for here.\nGo to the opposing side, do the same thing, starting at the corners and working your way across.

You'll really need to know your body dynamics and what's most comfortable for you, otherwise you may end up positioning the shield in a way that can cause pain with long-term use.\nYou can opt for a 'centre grip' shield and use a prefab handle. I've included a pic of one we made earlier (with a calico pocket for a very thick sword as well) that uses a sponge handle as the grip. I've also seen sanding tools, trowel handles and drawer handles used for this, but the biggest thing you're going to need to be aware of is that you only have a limited depth of wood to affix it to. You can NOT have any screw, nail or other fixing protruding through the board. It's a huge safety issue.

You can piece together a longer piece out of smaller pieces but for belts and straps that may be a little weight-bearing, I wouldn't recommend it. The smaller sheets of craft foam are great for smaller straps or making straps and buckles on things like bags and pouches.

Now heat your foam with your heat gun--if you're doing a long strip do this in sections only as long as you can cover with both hands--and then flip it over onto the foil and push down hard while the foam cools.

Take my advice, Buy in BULK!\nI had a few goals in mind when I was designing the build. I had to sacrifice some film accuracy for the sake of logistics. My main goals were the following:\nLIGHTWEIGHT: I'm not the strongest person and this was a costume that needed to be worn for a long period of time without killing myself. I think i accomplished this pretty well with hollow boxes and foam.\nMOBILITY: This was REALLY important. I wanted to be able to move with decent speed and be able to have a wide range of motion with the arms. With a big space like a convention center I needed to be able at a decent, if not fast, speed.\nTRANSPORTABLE: I have a Ford Focus.....Originally the goal was to create something I could break down and transport in just my car. In the end it turned out to big for a compact car. It did however, fit nicely in a full sized SUV. The whole thing can be broken down into 5 parts.\nINDEPENDENCE: I had hoped to create a costume I could get in and out of alone. I failed at this and the final costume required a Handler to help put the costume on.\nI'll be referencing these goals as I go through the process of the build and how they influenced the design choices.

Having never worn stilts, I wanted to get something that was easy for beginners. I found the shortest drywall stilts on Amazon. They ended up being 15\". I've seen other PL builds where they make their own stilts. That could be a better option for people looking for a shorter height or a steadier footing. But for me, the drywall stilts were perfect and easy to use. They also had the extra support of the leg brace, which was great for stability, but did get in the way of the joint I built in later.\nIt's really important to practice on the stilts and get all of the adjustments and sizing figured out before building around them. The way I built the leg made it difficult to adjust the settings afterwards.\nI would like to say I planned everything out well before starting this project.......but I did not. The first thing I did was just build a cardboard box around the lower part of the stilt with no real idea of what I was doing. I cut holes in the cardboard and used zip ties to secure the box to the stilt.\nIt's important to get this base REALLY secure. I had some issues later on with the whole foot sliding up and down the stilt as I was walking. It was much harder to secure it after all the foam was put on. I recommend making sure this base is very secure, and using grommets in any cardboard holes to prevent the ties digging into the cardboard. Or whatever you can come up with.

Don't use a saw. Use a box knife. It's a cleaner faster cut. to get an even circle for the top of the joint, i traced a large pot lid.\nI glued the foam to the cardboard base with a combination of tacky glue and hardware caulk. There's probably a better way to glue it but I'm literally figuring this out as I go along and it's not fallen apart yet.....so......whatever works.\nI made sure to add an extra layer of the foam on the inner part of the stilt to give myself room for my foot. I would actually suggest doing this on both sides, because you'll want a little extra space for the joint on the outer side.\nSanding down the edges was important(because I used a saw and it was a huge mess, use a box cutter and it's easier!)\nAfter assembling everything I also sealed all of the gaps with the silicone caulk...sanding it down after it tried. In addition to making everything look better, it helped keep everything from falling apart.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FY0/KV1J/JQMOJY24/FY0KV1JJQMOJY24.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYG/76BL/JM6KVMUZ/FYG76BLJM6KVMUZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJJ/PFHB/JM6KVMTV/FJJPFHBJM6KVMTV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Foam Party"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I call this next step....winging it without really looking to closely at the source material!\nThe lower legs were the first thing I did, so they're the least developed of the whole costume. I did a lot of experimenting during this stage, and just kind of trying things out as they came into mind. Since I was also on a timeline, I used shortcuts in the detail work. Take out container lids made for really easy cool looking details. Also bottle caps, and other random crap I found around my apartment.\nOriginally I wanted to have actual moving hydraulics. I've seen this done and it's actually pretty straightforward. Dowel rods inside of PVC. Mine ended up static because I changed my mind and ended up being all.....\"Meh, whatever, I'll just do it this way.\"\nHINDSIGHT: Limit the amount of bulky stuff on the inside of the legs. I walked with a wide stance, but the insides of the leg did bang into each other as I walked. I ended up having to take off both hydraulic bits from the insides(mostly because they fell off).\nOne thing I did use for a more metal look, is a one inch craft foam border around pretty much every edge. This allowed me to go in later and add shading and just gave the whole costume a more....realistic look? It was one of the simpler details that really added to the final look, even if i'm not sure 100% why.\nThe movie PL has these interesting metal flaps....things....sides? I cut a groove into the foam which made a good base to put the cardboard.\nHINDSIGHT: Cardboard isn't great on it's own. I had to later seal up the edges with caulk and in the end they were pretty easily damaged because cardboard isn't very strong. I'd use something more substantial on future builds.\nThe rest of the details were made from cardboard and craft foam.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9M/7DF2/JM6KVMVF/F9M7DF2JM6KVMVF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKM/8L2R/JM6KVMVV/FKM8L2RJM6KVMVV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE4/INGR/JM6KVMWE/FE4INGRJM6KVMWE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8G/J4P8/JM6KVMWV/F8GJ4P8JM6KVMWV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F14/J0GN/JM6KVMWZ/F14J0GNJM6KVMWZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSO/78T7/JM6KVMWY/FSO78T7JM6KVMWY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO3/6QWW/JM6KVMSW/FO36QWWJM6KVMSW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Cardboard Flappy Things"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "OK.....so....the main issue with the joint was the placement. The nice thing about the drywall stilts is the extra security created from the calf strap and the brace that goes up the outer leg. Unfortunately, the top of the brace was exactly where I needed the inside of the joint to go. It took some adjusting and I worked it out eventually by smooshing it around......but it wasn't the greatest, and like they say in the infomercials....\"There's gotta be a better way!\". Hopefully someone else with figure it out in the future and let me know.\nMobility goals are the reason only the lower half of the leg goes around the leg fully. Originally, i'd wanted to have a costume I could take on and off independently. To do this, I really needed to be able to SIT. By keeping the upper half of the costume limited to just the outer leg, I was able to walk, sit, and move around MUCH easier.\nOne thing that did work out really well was the ziptie belt loop. The upper half was pretty much just a layer of cardboard glued to foam board. through the cardboard I used a ziptie to create a loop. After gluing the inside of the cardboard to the foam, it made a really secure hook. I had originally planned on using a belt to secure the top part of the legs around my waist. But it ended up working better, to just tie the tops directly to the belt loops on my jeans. This kept the top part of the legs right at the hip joint and they didn't shift around much.\nThe height of the upper leg needs to not come above the hip bone or you risk hitting the torso part of the costume as you move. I had to cut down the upper leg for this reason.\nThe joint itself was a simple PVC pipe joint.\nHINDSIGHT: Secure the joint somehow. This joint is the one that got the most stress and one did eventually fail on the final hour, on the final day of Dragoncon. Since the upper half was secured to the Outside at the knee, and the top was secured to my hip, the top half was always bending inward. The hole where the PVC pipe was, was always getting bent and smooshed because it was just foam. Eventually the left joint smooshed the foam and doubled the size of the hole. The joint fell out. In the future I'd use some kind of material to serve as a grommet and keep the foam from getting damaged.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCV/VZZN/JM6KVMXI/FCVVZZNJM6KVMXI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1V/6BS2/JM6KVMXJ/F1V6BS2JM6KVMXJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHQ/OXT8/JM6KVMXM/FHQOXT8JM6KVMXM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE1/K317/JM6KVMXL/FE1K317JM6KVMXL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Joint Pain"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "When starting on the cage/pack part of the costume, the most important thing to keep in mind at every step is WEIGHT.

I thought it'd be great! It was, but it was also the heaviest part of the torso. I'd use a lighter, but still sturdy, backing.\nThe cage was the easiest part to make.

Before I even put the claw things on, I had cut the upper and lower arms to the size they were by just kind of eyeballing it. Once I went to add on the hands/claws the only way to keep the whole thing proportional and looking good was to have the whole arm end up being WAY bigger than I had ever intended.......and any hopes of being able to fit this costume in my little ford focus were dashed to pieces.\nBUT it all worked out. Because in the end, the arms are the centerpiece of the whole costume. They're the focus and the coolest part of it. They're the first thing people look at and get the most attention overall. So if you're going to put the most work into something, this is it. And in this case, bigger WAS better. I'm pretty please at how accidentally massive these turned out. Because of the lightweight foam, they were still very easy to manage.\nOriginally I was just going to use thinner craft foam to decorate the upper arm. But that ended up looking to thin. The big accent of the 1 inch foam on the upper arm was the better choice. I traced the outline of the upper arm out onto a new board and was able to draw what I wanted and cut it out so that it fit perfectly.\nThe claws are three foam boards across for the lower part, and two for the prongs. I had to fit the thin dowel rod through the prongs before fashioning them onto the base. Since this part of the costume is getting a little more fragile....I made sure to use dowel pins to secure the prongs to the base and the base to the upper arm......and since i didn't actually have dowel pins, i used shish kabobb sticks from my pantry and snapped them in to 2\" pieces.

It took a full two weeks.\nMy choice to use foam is great for weight......but inconvenient for painting. I was VERY lucky to discover BEFORE painting, that spray paint will dissolve foam. It just eats it away. To prevent this, takes a lot of time and layers.\nI started out with layers of modge podge to try and create a seal. I found a styrafoam primer spray at Michaels and tried that out as well. It's specifically made to protect foam so you can spray paint it. It worked.....kind of. I sprayed the first time too close to the foam, and even the primer started to eat away at it. I learned that you had to keep a distance when putting down layers. Unfortunately this left quite a lot of primer getting sprayed into the wind. I used up two cans right away and only got a dusting on my project. I do think the primer really works, but you've got to use a LOT to cover a project this big. I was not anticipating how much I would end up using. It was a large part of the end budget, which I why i did not end up using the primer on the arms.\nSince I was worried the primer wouldn't be enough, I took it a step further and covered everything in a layer of acrylic paint. I wouldn't use acrylic paint by itself, because it's streaky and looks cheap. But the extra layer did work well to stop the spray paint eating away.....mostly. You still have to spray at a distance. Don't get too close.\nI used Safety Yellow for the majority of the base, but I also did some shading with a Goldenrod (or any slightly orange yellow). I feel this second yellow color helped add some depth. It's not something you'd notice unless you're really looking for it, but I'd recommend it for a better end look.\nTLDR: MODGEPODGE, MODGEPODGE, FOAM PRIMER, ACRYLIC, SPRAY PAINT.\nHINDSIGHT: Use the Primer! While the arms looked fine without this step.....I did find that the spray paint didn't hold up that well under heat. I live in Florida and over time, the heat and humidity caused a bubbling effect on the paint. Luckily, it ended up looking more realistic, because paint on factory equipment DOES kind of do that. But over time, it's only going to get worse. The arms have bubbled WAY more than the legs where the primer was used.

But if there's anyone reading this, thinking about making their own, but don't really know if they're capable......DON'T WORRY! Because even if the build is a hot mess the whole way through.......a good paint job covers up EVERYTHING! If the paint work is good, it covers up all the little mistakes and messes, and parts that looked stupid before suddenly look pretty OK!\nFirst things first......the stickers, logos and stripes. I printed off all the logos and numbers and made them look like stickers decoupaging them onto the Build. AKA: i put down a layer of Modgepodge, put the logo, and put more modgepodge on top of that.\nThe stripes were just painted on very carefully after drawing them out with a ruler.\nMAKING THINGS LOOK METAL:\n1. So you have your freshly painted beautiful robot pieces. You've just put on the logo and stripes on....the black looks awesome against the yellow. You sit back and look at now neat and clean the whole thing looks..........AND THEN YOU BEAT THE LIVING CRAP OUT OF IT! Anyone who's ever worked with machinery knows it's not going to stay very clean for long. The dings and paint chips are what make it look more realistic. The best way to get the dinged and scratched look is to beat it up a little! This will hurt your soul a little, after having just spent weeks putting it together, but I promise it will make the finished look much better. I used scissors, heavy shoes, my dog, and just threw things around my apartment. The fancy term is \"Distressing\"\n2. After you've got your physical dings you want to take your metallic paint and paint silver into every scratch and groove. I also took a thin line of silver over every edge and extra on the corners. Anywhere that paint would usually wear away over time, i'd put some silver. Some places i'd use the acrylic silver, which is less opaque, and then wipe over with a cloth. This would leave a very thin layer and it would look like the yellow was slowly wearing off.\n3. Dirt, Grim, Oil. I have the advantage of working in Manufacturing. My factory is FILLED with reference material of what machines look like after a few uses. Unless there's someone taking a toothbrush and detailing their power loader every night.........there will be dirt and grime in EVERY crack and crevice. All the foam details I added before, now needed to be shaded, essentially. I found the best way to create this look, without everything looking like an outline or stencil...was to wipe away the paint with my finger or smudge it with a cloth as soon as I painted it on. Acrylic paint from Walmart or Target worked great for this.\n4. After I painted the whole thing, I actually went back and made the dirt and grime darker and more noticeable. It's a BIG costume and most people will be looking at it from a distance under florescent lights. While all the details are great up close, they get lost if you take a step back. Paint it like it's on a Large stage, not an intimate dinner theater.

Wearing this build was a challenge all in itself. BUT it was less than it looked. The lighter you can make the build the better. Overall I'm guessing mine was a total of 50-60 ish pounds. Just a few adjustments made a WORLD of difference walking the loader around the convention floor. My time at Dragoncon was almost a completely different experience.\nMEGACON:\nBecause my apartment is small, I hadn't actually had a chance to walk very far in the loader before the day of con. So my first real test run was at the convention itself. It hurt. A lot. First thing I learned was that I needed better shoes and more padding for the drywall stilts. I had walking shoes on, and the ankle straps dug painfully into the top part of my foot/ankle. With the stilts being extra heavy this got painful quickly. I ended up using socks to pad strap. The other two days, I used my work shoes, but they were not ankle high, so it only helped a little. The straps need to be as tight as possible to stay sturdy, so padding is essential.\nThe second thing I learned is how uncomfortable PVC pipe handles are. I didn't think much about padding the grip. Holding on to the bare plastic gave me blisters over time and dug into my hand. This wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for the over sight on the arms. The arms were very light weight.....at first....and very easy to handle.....at first. But since they had no straps or bungy to hold them, they were 100% held up by just ME. Holding any weight for a long period of time at a 90 degree angle with your arms is difficult. Especially if you're like me and have the upper body strength of a 6 year old.\nThe third thing was the pack...Oh the pack. I have never been a fan of heavy backpacks. It was always the worst thing about walking to school. I've never liked them. The weight really wasn't really bad. But over time it get's heavier and heavier. Since the pack was pretty cheap it dug into my shoulders and hurt by back. Anyone who saw me at Megacon noticed a continuing readjustment of the pack. I also ended up buying strips of moleskin to wear on my shoulders. This really helped prevent blisters from the straps.\nExertion- The nice thing about cons, is that the collective energy is revitalizing! The adrenaline I got from walking around the floor was better than all the caffeine or energy drinks in the world. I was able to go much longer that I ever thought my body could. I wouldn't describe the exertion as a cardio burst or anything. I was similar to using the stair machine. It was definitely a workout but I was never breathless. I was able to go an hour or so more at a time each day. Luckily I was stopped for photos often, so I got lots of breaks.\nDRAGONCON:\nFIX ALL THE PROBLEMS AND EVERYTHING IS BETTER! SO much better! So much! I bought brand new steel toed work shoes(I needed them for my job anyway). I got some with a strong base and a high lip. Drywall stilts are made for workmen and a workers boot made the stilt less wobbly and felt better. I was able to pull the ankle strap very tightly without any problem. To solve the issue of the calf strap, i bought a pair of foam knee pads and wore them lower. Worked perfectly. Incredibly tight strap with no pain. Feeling steady on your feet is amazing.\nThe arms got a \"Duh why didn't you do this right away\" strap that held them at 90 degrees when my arms were at rest. I still had full mobility of the arms and the straps could be removed if needed. But it took the workout off my arms by about 80%. I covered the entire handles with foam cushioning and then wrapped them in black grip tape. So much better!\nI couldn't get a new backpack. But as shown in the previous post, some simple padding and the addition of the hip strap was a huge difference. My shoulders still hurt over time. But it was low enough that I could Power through.\nThe costume was easier to wear also, because I decided to train before con! I felt pretty out of shape and tried to focus on getting better at endurance and building up my upper body strength.

The EL patch glows in the dark and gives a very retro \"cyberpunk\" feel to jacket. Though high tech fashion is becoming more mainstream, there's a lack of stylish clothing that's reasonably priced. This project is an attempt to make visually pleasing wearables more accessible to the public.\nThe method is versatile enough that you can affix the EL patches to other pieces of clothing but this instructable will focus on making EL patches just for jackets.\nThe total cost is roughly $100, $50 in EL panels, $30 for the jacket and the rest for miscellaneous cost, such as the cloth, glue, etc.\nThe method described in this instructable will be focused on the workflow used to create the EL panels but can be altered depending on what kind of access to materials, software and machines you have.\nThe basic idea is to laser cut some art, glue it to an EL panel and then affix it to a jacket with velcro. The wires are poked through the back of the jacket and wired through the lining to access the power source in the jacket pocket. The patches are semi flexible and act like standard jacket patches.\nThe patches on the jacket are a bit fragile but can withstand \"everyday\" usage. Protecting the panels from breakage is an ongoing experiment and the current methods presented below, such as strain relief, are our current attempts at making the panels more robust against normal use.\nEven though the idea is pretty simple, we think the results look striking.\nAll the designs we've made are made free/libre (with a CC0 license, where applicable) and can be found on our GitHub page, ElleMal-data.

If you'd like to use the art already created, you can proceed to step 2.\nThe first step is to get a general sense of the design and pick out art to be used in the patch. We wanted a modern occult look with a moth as the centerpiece. Archive.org has a massive database of public domain texts and art.\nWe searched Archive.org for old texts from the 1800s and before. We found a good filter was to look for natural history texts with illustrations. We found we had the best results with laser cutting the art when the original piece was hand drawn or woodcut. Photographs often have too much detail that lead to artifacts and noise in the final stencil.\nOnce we decided on a source picture, we downloaded a large resolution of the image and imported it into Gimp (Archive.org link to original picture). We cropped it, converted to a black and white image and then did a threshold on it to make it as close to a two color stencil as possible.\nWe added some other effects, like a triangle that inverts the base moth image, a dotted circle and an stylized eclipse at the bottom (taking as source material another Archive.org link to a lunar eclipse)\nThe white pixels will be 'burned' by the laser cutter. This means that any 'islands' of black surrounded by white will fall out. These islands should either be removed or, if important to the design, be attached to a connecting region.\nCare has to be taken to reinforce thin black lines as a high powered laser will obliterate the line. We found that reinforcing thin black lines to be at least 2-4 pixels wide with 2-4 pixels spacing between other black regions, worked well. This is dependent on image resolution and final physical design size, so this might need a few iterations to determine which regions to reinforce and by how much. We also added some 'noise' to the wings by choosing a \"noisy\" brush and added some jitter to give some randomness. This extra noise helps reinforce the material as the laser won't burn the portions that are dark.\nOnce the art piece has been cleaned up, we export to PNG format and\nimport the PNG into LaserWeb4.\nThe parameters in LaserWeb4 were tailored to the laser cutter we have access to. In our case, the laser cutter cut speed was set to `4999 mm/min`, with the `Burn White` option unselected and the `Invert Color` option selected.\nThe PNG image in LaserWeb4 is resized to the desired final size. In our case, this was mostly limited to the bed size of the laser cutter, which has a maximum work area of roughly 7 inches in height and 11 inches in width.\nOnce we're happy with the set parameters and sizing, we export the image to GCode and save it.\nWith the art exported into GCode file, we move our attention to creating the lettering.\nWe used Inkscape to create the lettering. If the font desired already exists in Inkscape, that can be used, otherwise, additional fonts can be added.\nWe decided on The League of Moveable Type's font called Blackout. We find the Blackout font aesthetically pleasing and has a nice feature that there are no 'islands' in each of the characters. For example, normally 'O' and 'A' characters have an island the would need to be secured or removed.\nUsing the Blackout font, we created the two words we want in our design, \"CITIZEN DARK\", and export each to an SVG file.\nThe Blackout font has two paths per letter, one that represents the outside and the other for the inside. In order to only cut one path, the inside path for each character was removed.\nWe chose to display metric units for Inkscape and resized the lettering large enough to cover most of the back of the jacket but small enough to fit within the laser cutter bed.\nEach word was placed within a bounding rectangle. This rectangle will be cut by the laser cutter and represents the bounds of the patch lettering.\nIn our case, this was making the lettering 60mm in height with a 20mm border on each side for the box, giving us 100mm for the total height and just under 260mm for the visible portion of the longest word (\"CITIZEN\") with the total size of the longest text patch being 300mm.\nUsing a custom script (called svg2ngc), we converted the SVG file to a GCode. The parameters used were `8000 mm/min` for rapid speed, `1500 mm/min` for cutting speed and full power for the laser (in our case a 40W CO2)\nOnce we have the three GCode files, one for the art and the other two for each word of the lettering (\"CITIZEN DARK\"), we are ready to cut the cloth.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFI/N8UO/JQMO8S74/FFIN8UOJQMO8S74.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAZ/245T/JQMO8TMK/FAZ245TJQMO8TMK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWA/9IAM/JQMO8SPQ/FWA9IAMJQMO8SPQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F59/MCA9/JQMO8SVU/F59MCA9JQMO8SVU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT3/DJB1/JQMO8SNK/FT3DJB1JQMO8SNK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLV/QJYM/JQMO8SSS/FLVQJYMJQMO8SSS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Design Art and Lettering"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "For each design, a large piece of cloth is initially cut with scissors and placed on the laser cutter bed. The size of the cut cloth needs to be larger than the pattern to be cut but should be small enough to fit within the confines of the laser cutter bed. The fabric should lie flat on the bed. Taping the fabric on it's edges onto the laser cutter bed can help to make sure it's secured firmly. If the fabric needs securing, whatever method used should not obscure the cut area.\nWe chose nylon cloth that is thick so we left the laser cutter power at full (as chosen in the GCode conversion in LaserWeb4 above). If cutting thinner cloth, a high power on the laser cutter might lose detail but for the cloth we use, this is not a concern. If cutting with a laser cutter that has a different power rating or cloth with a different thickness, you should adjust the power of the laser cutter and the speed accordingly.\nEach GCode file is sent individually to the laser cutter to be cut. If the cut isn't the quality that you want, the original artwork might need to be altered to accommodate. Options for troubleshooting bad cuts this will be dependent on the art, the laser cutter and the materials being cut.\nSome common options to improve the cuts are reinforcing thin black lines in the original art, altering the laser cutter power and changing the cut laser cut speed.\nOnce each piece is cut on the laser cutter, carefully remove the work from the bed, making sure not to damage the interior detail.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUZ/O9XP/JQMO8TCN/FUZO9XPJQMO8TCN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIL/6JIM/JQMO8TXF/FIL6JIMJQMO8TXF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZQ/P7ZY/JQMO8TEW/FZQP7ZYJQMO8TEW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVV/MF8Q/JQMO8TIW/FVVMF8QJQMO8TIW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Cut Design on Laser Cutter"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "A common failure of the EL panels is the disconnection of the power lines to the soldered joints on the panel.

We want to make the access cuts on the back of the jacket as innocuous as possible, so we'll want to cut the EL panels so they'll place well on the back of the jacket.\nThe basic workflow is to get a sense for where the patches will be on the jacket, along with where the access holes need to be cut. Once we're happy with positioning, we can cut the EL panel and make sure it can be placed well on the back of the jacket. We'll go back and forth between spot checking placement on the back of the jacket, cutting the EL panel, making sure the cloth can be aligned over the EL panel and cutting access holes in the jacket.\nPlace the patches as best you can on the back of the jacket and block out where they'll be with masking tape. The masking tape will be used as guides when doing final placement. There should be a bit of leeway in positioning the patches so it doesn't need to be highly accurate.\nAlign the EL panel on top of the back of the jacket where it will finally go, aligning it to the masking tape registration marks. Put the cloth portion over it to get a sense for where the cloth portion will overlap the EL panel.\nWe've found that overlaying masking tape on top of the EL panel, so we can mark it with a pencil without worrying about dirtying the lit area, works well. Make sure to turn on the EL panel when placing to make sure the cloth positioning and eventual patch positioning is being done in the region of the EL panel that actually lights up.\nTrace out the portion to cut on the masking tape.\nOnce we've decided where to cut, cut the EL panel with scissors. Don't cut the EL panel while powered. Power off the EL panel while cutting unless you want to get a shock. When cutting the EL panel with scissors, you want to make sure not to twist or bend the panel, scissors or shear line where you're cutting. We want to keep the top and bottom layer of the plastic coating on the EL panel as undisturbed as possible to make sure there's a solid connection so the whole panel can fluoresce.\nWe want to leave a portion of the EL panel available so that it can go into a cut access hole in the back of the jacket. In the image, you can see a long \"trace\" of EL panel that will feed into the access hole in the back of the jacket.\nOnce the panel is cut, place the cloth patch over to make sure it looks good. Make sure to do placement like this with the EL panel on as it's sometimes hard to tell where the panel's light boundaries are.\nCover the strip with electrical tape to reinforce it and make sure there's minimal light bleeding outside of the area we're interested in.\nRemove the masking tape if need be and do a final spot check to make sure the patch looks good.\nWe'll now cut an access hole in the jacket and do some spot checks to make sure the panels still can be positioned where we want them to be.\nFirst cut an access hole in the jacket to feed the EL panel strip through.\nOnce the access hole is cut, we can feed the EL panel through and do a spot check to make it can still be placed where we want it to.\nOnce this is done for the \"DARK\" patch, do the same for the moth patch and the \"CITIZEN\" patch.\nTo get a better handle on where to cut the access hole, you can use masking tape and some marks.\nNow we have a good idea that the patches can be aligned and placed on the back of the jacket, it's time to glue the cloth portion to the EL panel and place them in their final position on the jacket.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWF/W6LA/JQMO8R8S/FWFW6LAJQMO8R8S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO7/I3RW/JQMO8RBY/FO7I3RWJQMO8RBY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG6/E67A/JQMO8UPX/FG6E67AJQMO8UPX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTY/57XL/JQMO8UQK/FTY57XLJQMO8UQK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA4/DPRF/JQMO8UTU/FA4DPRFJQMO8UTU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVQ/9R7V/JQMO8UT6/FVQ9R7VJQMO8UT6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2N/JKVU/JQMO8RD2/F2NJKVUJQMO8RD2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBF/TOCZ/JQMO8REJ/FBFTOCZJQMO8REJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMC/9WTI/JQMO8RH4/FMC9WTIJQMO8RH4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5K/VD5E/JQMO8RLZ/F5KVD5EJQMO8RLZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF3/WRZL/JQMO8RO1/FF3WRZLJQMO8RO1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYZ/W7PY/JQMO8T24/FYZW7PYJQMO8T24.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYU/NVI9/JQMO8RPQ/FYUNVI9JQMO8RPQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ9/G6UD/JQMO8RSB/FZ9G6UDJQMO8RSB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ4/VNKZ/JQMO8ULF/FZ4VNKZJQMO8ULF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA0/CZ4S/JQMO8UKV/FA0CZ4SJQMO8UKV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC4/OGN3/JQMO8UMK/FC4OGN3JQMO8UMK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRE/28HT/JQMO8UNP/FRE28HTJQMO8UNP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1R/V634/JQMO8UOT/F1RV634JQMO8UOT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ1/GJ4V/JQMO8V7Q/FJ1GJ4VJQMO8V7Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTZ/UPPX/JQMO8VA8/FTZUPPXJQMO8VA8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Q/3J9I/JQMO8VBJ/F1Q3J9IJQMO8VBJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9D/1YWK/JQMO8VC5/F9D1YWKJQMO8VC5.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Cut EL Panels and Rough Patch Alignment"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Before gluing, do a rough spot check to make sure everything is aligned and looks good.\nOnce we're happy with the rough placement, it's time to glue the cloth portion to the EL panel.

Is it happening at the EL panel or before?\nTry to do the simple test to figure out where the problem is generally so you can drill down to where the problem is occurring specifically.\nFinding out where the problem is will tell you whether you need to change the batteries, resolder connections, replace the inverter or replace the panel.\nA single panel doesn't light up!\nCheck to make sure the panel is connected to the wire splitter or inverter.\nTest the EL panel individually to see if it's a problem with the panel or something else before coming to the panel.\nIf it's not the inverter or connecting wires, this might mean the panel itself has failed. Some common failures we've seen are:\nThe solder joints where the wires connect to the panel fray off (which is why we tried to put some strain relief on them),\nThe connecting EL 'strip' gets bend and breaks the connection to the rest of the panel.\nCutting the panel, soldering onto the panel or screwing through the panel causes a short and the panel doesn't work.\nMost of these are catastrophic failure conditions and only rarely does the EL panel not need to be replaced.\nA single panel lights up intermittently or flickers!\nThis is most often due to a frayed or loose connection. Do the obvious checks of making sure the connections are secure from the EL panel to the wire splitter and that the connecting wires have good continuity.\nIn most cases, though, this means the EL panel will most likely need to be replaced.\nWe've had some success in resoldering connections to the EL panel but this needs to be done with\ncare as the plastic sheets sandwiching the EL paint are conductive and a mis-solder on where the wire connects to the panel might cause a short, rendering the EL panel useless.\nThe Inverter Emits a High \"Buzzing\"\nMost inverters we've used have a high pitched 'whine', which is normal, but occasionally when inverters fail, they start to \"buzz\", which sounds different from their normal whining. This usually means the inverter is malfunctioning or dying and probably needs to be replaced. It might inconsistently light up the panels, or dimly light up the panels, which is another symptom that the inverter is dying.\nThe Inverter Emits a High Pitched Whine\nThis is normal.\nEL panels operate by pushing a high voltage, high frequency alternating current signal across the EL paint to fluoresce. The originating power source is coming from a 12V DC battery pack (from 6 AA batteries). This means the the 12V DC current needs to be converted to around a 100V 1000Hz signal.\nThe 1000Hz signal sounds to most people like a high pitched whine. I've heard that the culprit in most inverters is a capacitor that resonates at that frequency which is why the whine is audible.\nThe good news is that the inverter is covered by the jacket and even modest background noise (at a club, in a bar, normal conversation) will make the inverter whine unnoticeable.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 12: Troubleshooting"}, {"step": 13, "steps_text": "You can use other designs and lettering to make your own EL patches.

The film reprised key elements from the original including the iconic light cycle races and the glowing lines of light of the costumes.\n\nI have mixed feelings about the film, as many do; it is visually stunning. The light suits and lightcycles in particular are in my opinion up there with the very best film costumes and vehicles of all time. The soundtrack by Daft Punk is fantastic and fits with the visuals seamlessly. Unfortunately I was left feeling somewhat disappointed that the story doesn't fully match up to the visuals.\nWhilst much of the film is CGI, there are significant, and important elements that weren't, and having an interest in practical effects, these really appeal to me. Key sets were built fully practical, and incorporated the iconic lighting (End of the Line Club, Flynn's arcade etc.), and importantly the light suits and other costumes were completely practical. I was therefore inspired to try and create a real, practical light suit myself, and so embarked on the significant task of working out how...\nI started my costume build by deciding that as others may be interested, I wanted to be able to create more than one costume. I therefore decided to put effort into creating drawings, patterns and moulds to be able to produce multiples of parts. I also wanted to experiment with some techniques and materials not familiar to me, and this gave me a good opportunity.\nMy vision for the costume is not to produce something fully screen accurate to the film, but neither to create something simple but Tron like. Rather I would make something that to a general observer looks like the film versions, but is of a far better quality than cheap Halloween costumes, is durable, and most importantly has real functioning lighting. It would be very difficult to replicate the cast foam latex method used in the films without a serious budget and a lot of time, and so I chose to use a laminated flexible flat foam method instead.\nIt has always been my desire to make the costume fully lit, not relying on retro-reflective tapes as others have done. I therefore considered a wide range of options for lighting, but settled for the more expensive, but lower work option of using a kit of pre-cut electroluminescent shapes (from EL wire craft). This ties in with an easier ability to make multiple costumes.\nThe project started with an information gathering stage- there is a lot of information scattered around out there. My key reference sources are listed later.\nThe second stage was to do design work before starting builds- this started with the identity disks.\nI have primarily used Draft Sight software for design, this being a free CAD program similar to Autocad that I'm familiar with in my day job, allowing me to produce accurate dimensioned drawings and patterns.

Many earlier costumes have used the Disney deluxe toy disk, and modified it; however these are now becoming uncommon and expensive, so I took the decision to make my own mouldings.\nI made a few minor changes to the screen part for the sake of easier manufacturing (such as the angle of the light ring), but it keeps the general theme, and also ensures that the disk can be easily handled. I am familiar with woodwork and have a good range of tools that made making the pattern relatively simple, although I still had to buy a large 45 degree router cutter- it will be easier to sculpt from clay if you don't have the workshop facilities.\nThe master disk is made from MDF- but you will probably need many layers of primer and paint, spot putty and a lot of careful sanding to get a good finish. I have since learnt of the trick of using superglue to seal MDF that may have save you quite a lot of time.\nI used Mold Max 20 silicone from Smooth on to make the mould, and backed with plaster- there are plenty of instructables on casting. I recommend moulding in GRP to make the disk stiff enough.\nThe illumination is by EL wire sunk into the C ring and glued in place. The inverter is inside the disk. This is a standard inverter with the case removed and the battery holder replaced with an AAA unit to make it fit. The on off button pokes through the disk and is un-obtrusive.

Unfortunately the EL shape drawings supplied were scant of information and distorted, so I had to wait until I took delivery of actual parts to measure and re-draw.\nThe costume design started by tracing drawings from film stills and production photos into 2D CAD. Unfortunately there aren't many good full view photos, so I have had had to piece together the design from many different images. Once traced in I overlaid the design with the EL shapes. Unfortunately there are quite a lot of differences in these to the film. I therefore had to create a hybrid design using elements of the production design where possible, the EL shapes where necessary and tweaking to suit my body shape with patterns on a duct tape dummy. This sounds simple but has been a long-winded process and in the end might not have been the most efficient method, although it does result in drawings published here.\nMy wife helped me produce a duct tape dummy to use during the build. There are plenty of tutorials out there that will give you a good idea how to do this, however there are definitely a few key points I discovered that you may find useful;\nIt is very difficult to get the dummy accurate without distortion, both during the wrapping stage and the filling stage- you will need to be very careful to produce the least distorted dummy possible.\nYou will need a LOT of stuffing. I cut up foam from old sofa seat pads and scrap upholstery foam on the bandsaw into cubes of about30-40mm. I got through over two dustbins full of it. Packing it in enough to give a firm shape compressed it a lot.\nI recommend creating a simple wooden skeleton that to either hang the dummy from a screw eye at the neck or stand on the floor. The ability to change between these methods will be useful. My skeleton was built with flexibility at the waist and ankles to ease getting the costume on and off. No skeleton was fitted in the arms.\nThe costume construction concept is to use two layers of flat sheets of foam fitted over a matt cotton-lycra catsuit. (Plastazote LD45).\nPlastazote may be a bit more expensive than the commonly used EVA foam and camp mats, however I take the view that one of the key areas of failure in a project can be materials. If I am carrying out a project such as this where I am making a significant investment in time, then I want to be sure that the materials used of a good quality and importantly consistent. With the Plastazote I am able to order to a defined specification, and to be able to order more material to that same spec at any time I need. In addition, the Plastazote tears significantly less easily than the thin EVA foam that was available, a distinct advantage, although the surface structure is somewhat more open. It is also difficult to find consistent EVA foam in the UK in the 5-6mm range needed.\nBefore starting the build in earnest, I recomend gathering samples and carrying out tests of materials and techniques so that I could have confidence the final project is going to work and be durable.\nMost of the established foam fabricated costume sites are US based and so recommend 'Barge Cement' as a suitable adhesive for bonding foam together. In the UK this is not widely available, so I chose to use Evostik 528 as this is readily in reasonable size cans- I bought mine from the local builders merchant. It is also possible to get a thinner/ cleaner for it which can come in handy. So far it has proven to be a good choice.\nThe foam is cut into shape using a very sharp knife (you will need to sharpen regularly) to the patterns, and bonded together using the contact adhesive.\nIn areas where joins are made or, places where the foam will not take the stress on its own reinforcet using black calico. This is particularly important round the base of the torso section and is used to attach the velcro needed around the waist.\nLow profile hook and loop tape to is used to secure the EL wire to the costume .This has a mated thickness of approx. 2mm and so is fairly unobtrusive,\nTo attach the disk, I manufactured a plastic moulding that snugly fitted into the disk centre by making a wooden mould and vacuum forming HIPS sheet over it. The battery sits in a separate moulding made in the same way and the two are linked together by a sheet of HIPS. This is then laminated into the back of the costume. mount number of powerful magnets in both the disk and the moulding- This is sufficient to hold the disk, but make it easy enough to remove. If you don't have access to a vacuum former, these parts could also be moulded out of GRP, or you may be lucky enough to find a plastic container of a suitable size.\nThe Evostik adhesive isn't suited for bonding to the cotton lycra, it tends to peel too easily. For these areas use 3M 76 spray adhesive. This is quite a lot more expensive but is much more effective. As it is a spray adhesive, parts not to be covered needed masking up with a combination of cling film and masking tape.\nThe gloves are made from a pair of neoprene diving gloves with the fingers cut off and embellished with foam and then painted with the Plasti-dip.\nOnce assembled, parts that required it were masked off and the foam sprayed with three coats of black Plasti-dip giving a rubbery and durable matt black finish.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0X/JIFA/JOSY1JR5/F0XJIFAJOSY1JR5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCJ/VO04/JOSY1G37/FCJVO04JOSY1G37.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2Z/6QO2/JOSY1H0L/F2Z6QO2JOSY1H0L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW4/Z48A/JOSY1GXT/FW4Z48AJOSY1GXT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVW/BD94/JOSY1K91/FVWBD94JOSY1K91.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAP/ZKWU/JOSY1IIY/FAPZKWUJOSY1IIY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPP/FF64/JOSY1HOS/FPPFF64JOSY1HOS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLX/P62T/JOSY1EP5/FLXP62TJOSY1EP5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEZ/1KNL/JOSY1GMN/FEZ1KNLJOSY1GMN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRW/JST0/JOSY1JXZ/FRWJST0JOSY1JXZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6D/BNGN/JOSY1L6W/F6DBNGNJOSY1L6W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2J/I0XC/JOSY1GRJ/F2JI0XCJOSY1GRJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCS/SJRX/JOSY1F3T/FCSSJRXJOSY1F3T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVI/2CVO/JOSY1FJO/FVI2CVOJOSY1FJO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYN/NI1V/JOSY1H6L/FYNNI1VJOSY1H6L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN4/S87Q/JOSY1IVW/FN4S87QJOSY1IVW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKX/DLAJ/JOSY1KE8/FKXDLAJJOSY1KE8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0B/NKAG/JQKTXL09/F0BNKAGJQKTXL09.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Step 3: Costume Part 1"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "EL Lighting\nThe panels come with a wiring harness, but I chose to redesign this to my own needs.

After a thorough clean the outside was protected from overspray with cling film, enabling the helmet to be held up to the light during spraying to ensure an even and opaque coating.

This is clearly more movie-accurate, and it prevents other people from being able to easily see the wearer\u2019s eyes. The caveat is that the wearer still needs to be able to see out of the mask.\nI decided to use the dark lenses from some old, cheap sunglasses.\nUnfortunately, these weren\u2019t quite large enough to cover the entire eye holes, so I made a sort of gasket out of 1mm EVA foam sheet to fill the area. I used a piece of paper to trace the shape of the eye holes, then cut it out and transferred it to the foam sheet. I used black foam, but feel free to choose whatever color goes best with your design scheme.\nI then glued the lenses to the back of the foam gaskets using hot glue. Now, I wear prescription glasses, but they do not easily fit inside the mask (and I am quite blind without them). Therefore, I decided to glue the lenses from an old pair of glasses onto the back of the sunglass lenses. This way I will be able to wear the mask without my normal glasses and still be able to see fairly well. I waited to permanently glue these into the mask until the painting process was finished so that I didn\u2019t risk getting paint on the lenses.\nThis little mod turned out pretty well. The mask now looks much more realistic, and it allows me to wear it without my glasses.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5N/QEDX/JPQTDKLG/F5NQEDXJPQTDKLG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSQ/D4M7/JPQTDKJ8/FSQD4M7JPQTDKJ8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Covering the Eye Holes"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The mask in its original state was quite bare and lacking detail, so I decided to scour my stash of plastic parts for anything that I could glue onto the mask to spice it up. Model pieces, NERF and airsoft parts, electronic components, various hardware parts, and plastic toy pieces are great for this type of thing. The best pieces typically have some sort of interesting texture to them.\nAfter gathering as many potential parts as possible, I held each of them on the mask to try to find where they should go. Once the final parts and their corresponding locations on the mask were chosen, I used super glue to attach them. You could also use hot glue or epoxy, but super glue is plenty strong and it dries pretty quickly.\nIn addition to the exterior details, I glued some foam padding to the inside of the mask to make it more comfortable and to cover the exposed chin area.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6S/CY3D/JPSNY5UZ/F6SCY3DJPSNY5UZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Adding Details"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "My first thought for this mask was to make the eyes glow, but I quickly realized that this would not work with the lenses I was using.

The LEDs I used are blue in color, rated for 12 volts, and are pre-wired (meaning they already come with a resistor soldered to the LED). The LEDs are wired in parallel to a 9 volt battery (yes this is less than 12, but the LEDs just won\u2019t be as bright) and are activated by a push button switch.\nThe battery and most of the wires are glued down inside the forehead of the mask.\nThe button was glued into a length of PVC and is connected to the rest of the circuit via a long wire.

This covers up the original colors on the mask and helps the rest of the paint adhere better.\nNext, I sprayed 3-4 coats of tan over the whole mask, letting each coat dry for about 10 minutes.\nFrom this point on I used brush paints, but spray paints will work too. I began by filling in the larger sections with acrylic paint before moving onto the smaller details. In this case, I painted the black, then the green, then the silver. Painter\u2019s tape helped to get clean lines between colors, and a hairdryer helped to dry each coat faster.\nWith the main colors dry, I moved onto the details. I wanted to give the mask a military feel, so I found some designs for military decals on the internet and made stencils using painter\u2019s tape.\nThis isn't part of the painting process, but I also added a claw mark detail across the left eye. I found the design on Google, then printed it out and traced it onto some faux carbon fiber vinyl. The vinyl has an adhesive backing which allows you to apply it just like a sticker.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 8: Painting"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "The Iron Man paint scheme (or Iron Patriot in this case) is very clean, but I wanted to create a grittier, more used and abused look for my mask. This was accomplished through the use of weathering, which is a very common painting/prop making technique.\nNormally I make my props look dirty by using multiple layers of washes, but this time I wanted to try a technique I saw Bill Doran use on the Punished Props YouTube channel (check them out for all kinds of prop building goodness). Bill rubbed graphite powder over his parts to give them a metallic sheen that adds another layer of depth to the color. Watch this video from 10:18-11:55 to see his process and the results. I used a pencil and sandpaper to create a pile of graphite powder, put some on my fingertip, then rubbed it all over the black and silver areas of the mask.\nI also rubbed graphite on the tan areas, but mostly on the high and low spots to create a shadow effect. Be aware that the graphite is very messy and will rub off of the mask until a clear coat is applied.\nAnother great technique for weathering is dry brushing. This is when you put paint on your brush, but you wipe almost all of it off before lightly swiping it across your part. This creates highlights on any raised areas, and it looks like exposed metal beneath the paint. I used silver and copper Testors enamel paints for this. Finally, for that final level of realism, I took an Xacto blade and scraped paint off of several corners and edges. Once all of the weathering was complete, I sprayed 3 coats of clear over the entire mask.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCR/GYD3/JPQTDKL3/FCRGYD3JPQTDKL3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2A/BWUH/JPQTDKL7/F2ABWUHJPQTDKL7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F03/C3CO/JPQTDKLB/F03C3COJPQTDKLB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFE/0RWV/JPQTDKM8/FFE0RWVJPQTDKM8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7F/ORUH/JPQTDKM9/F7FORUHJPQTDKM9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Weathering"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "Once the clear coat was dry, I began to add all of the final details.

Inner layer can have the textured side facing in any direction because you won't see it under the 2nd and 3rd. Now because EVA foam is flexible you will need support inside. I used a lightweight steel rebar that I found at Home Depot. It retains it's shape well and is thin enough that you just have to cut a very shallow indent into your foam to sandwich it between layers. So you should be tracing the 3 layers out first, then using your xacto blade to cut them out as cleanly as possible, then cutting a small trench into any side of the middle layer you can insert the metal (skeleton) and anchor it down with some hot glue.

Then take your masking tape or painters tape and cover the whole surface. Along the top and bottom of the rifle denote where the center line is and mark it with a sharpie. This way you can template on one side of the rifle, then flip it to use on the other half, creating a symmetrical shell. Unfortunately I forgot to photograph the templates but you want to take the foil masking off of the piece, cut off all the excess, then lay it out flat to create the pattern onto 5mm eva foam. If a piece wont lay flat cut a curved relief into it so it will lay flat.

Next take a bowl of water and dip your 1000 grit sandpaper into it, then buff the surface of the foam on any seams.

The result of that inquiry was my own take on this, which I have documented in its own instructable. I even made a nice Tardis / Ollivander hybrid box for it to be kept in and again, made an instructable for that. Going further out of my way I designed a huge, A1 blueprint-like poster for the wand which you can grab for free and print for non-commercial purposes if you feel like it. Print it, slap it onto your wall, make your own T-Shirt with it, as long as you don't make any money off it and maybe, just maybe send me a picture of it I'm cool with it.\nIt was supposed to be a one-off project, yet time and time again I had been asked if there was a possibility to make another one. It seems access to woodworking lathes is rather limited, which in hindsight should come as no surprise. I mean if you don't have a lathe yourself, how do you even find someone who does? Plus, using one isn't that straightforward either. Nonetheless, citing some excuse or other I got away from getting roped into making another one. Until recently one determined lass managed to bribe, I mean convince me to bring this project back to life. Kind of felt like the situation of Fluffy getting booked for a show in Saudi Arabia (0:59 - 1:45 minutes). The catch this time is now that I have my very own 3D printer I'll be allowed to make the whole thing 3D printable, though mixed media or complete wood reconstruction is, of course, still possible for anyone who wants to do so. I think that access to 3D printers or 3D printing services ought to be far better than the woodworking lathe supply, so I might actually lay this to rest for good this time. Who knows? At the very least it'll be much simpler for me to make full or partial kits for all those bugging me. Just drop me a message here on instructables, on deviantart, thingiverse, flickr or youtube. I still don't want to redo the whole thing again, as it's a tremendous time sink which I'd rather invest into making something new. And I've learned to loathe sanding. It's so tedious but there is so. Much. Of. It.\nIn short:\nRejoice, you Whovian Potterheads, for it is time for Sonic Wand 2: The FDM Redux!

Super glue and epoxy resin are quite sticky and the fumes aren't good for your health, so take appropriate precautions. Work in well-ventilated areas and avoid skin contact in the latter case.

Additionally I have procured some rather decent pictures from a production-used Sonic Screwdriver from Doctor Who episode \u201cThe Day of the Doctor\u201d thanks to a tbt Props sale as well as from a high-quality replica by The Celestial Toystore.\nNow it was never the intention to make a perfect replica, so my design is still not that accurate in respect to the original prop. I actually know for a fact that there are mistakes. It is, however, more detailed than my previous version with most differences being in the details. I've added some of the buttons and grooves found on the original. The general design can be seen in the sketches I have attached here. If you want to download them, I have attached a PDF of them a couple steps further down, specifically at the wooden wand part.\nIn cooperation with the commissioner I have also taken steps to have the wand and grip part seperate (as was done previously) and joined by a steel rod to give a higher weight to the Sonic Wand, making it feel higher-class than it actually is.

I tried my hand at it but the results weren't great, most likely as my experience with this software is close to nonexistant and I didn't have the time to put into learning it to a sufficient level right now. If you're more well-versed and want to take a try, teach me a few tricks or so I'd really appreciate it. I'll gladly attach your altered STL files to this instructable (with attribution, of course), or better yet you make a remix on thingiverse and I'll link to that here.\nFor now I decided to go with a regular, turned, wooden wand which I'll stain and varnish. I have attached PDF plans for the whole wand to this step.\nCardboard Template:\nI have attached a PDF printout with all the dimensions and one wand which can be used as a template. It's in A4 format, just scale it accordingly if you use US Letter or some other format for printing. Or tell me in the comments which format you prefer and I'll see what I can do. By the way, after printing, do check the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the parts to make sure you printed it at the right scale - for some reason my printer prints it just a bit too small even though I set it to \"no scaling\", so I have to compute the right scaling factor.\nThe formula goes like this:\nIntended_length / Actual_Length * 100 = Scaling Factor in %\nI got 180mm / 169mm *100 = 106.5%\nTo use the printout as a proper template I applied a bit of spray adhesive to some cardboard and glued the paper sketch printout on top of it, then proceeded to cut out the wand and more importantly, the outside shape of the wand. Basically what's usually used as a throwaway now becomes an excellent template for the woodturning. An exacto knife did the cutting part of the job just fine.\nWoodturning and Sanding:\nSame as the last time I'll be using my somewhat underpowered but cute modelmaking woodturning lathe made by Proxxon, the trusty little DB-250. As always when using power tools, wear appropriate protection - safety googles and a dust mask (not pictured) are highly recommended.\nFor starters I affixed some round stock beech in the lathe. It's 14mm in diameter, conveniently the same as the maximum diameter of the wand part. It's almost as if I scaled it like that to make my job a bit easier...anyway, once that was done I could affix the template to the lathe tool rest, spin the lathe up at the slowest speed and use a pencil to mark points at which there will be a step in the wood body.\nBy the way, the pencil I am using here is a Uni Kuru Toga Roulette (this is the place where I first heard about it, and a gem of a site full of cool tools - hence the site's name), a truly superb mechanical pencil which I highly recommend. There's different models at different prices, all with the auto-sharpening / pencil lead turning feature, but they're all reasonable and I like the aluminium body Roulette version the best. Uni's Kuru Toga pencil lead is fantastic, too.\nAnyway, I used various lathe chisels to shape the wood, continuously using the template, plans and calipers to check if my measurements are all right. Of course as it's handmade they're not perfect, but they should be somewhat close.\nDo note that I have the template facing in such a way that the thick end which I do not need to turn down is at the tailstock while the tip which needs a lot of turning is closer to the jaw chuck. This serves two purposes - for one the workpiece is more stable towards the chuck and thus turning is easier and safer, and secondly I get a centered divet at the back end thanks to the tail stock which I can then use for center drilling the wand.\nAfter I was done with the woodturning I left the piece in the lathe and used 120 grit sandpaper for preliminary smoothing of the wand part while letting it spin at the slowest possible speed and keeping my hands well away from the chuck. Rapidly spinning stuff is scary, after all. Not to mention dangerous.\nCutting Plug and Tip Rounding:\nI used a simple miniature hacksaw to carefully cut off the plug at the tip of the wand, roughly shaped it by twisting, turning and rubbing it on a fine file and gave it a round finish using 120 grit sandpaper.\nDrilling Connection Rod Fitting\nNow if you remember the design, one of the possible choices is to use an 8mm metal rod as a core to add some weight, some heft to the Sonic Wand. While it is certainly possible to limit oneself to the Sonic Screwdriver / grip part it is also possible to extend that rod into the wand part and use it as a connector. To that end it is necessary to drill out the wand part about 60-70mm deep and 8-9mm in diameter as centrically and straight as possible.\nNow for good / proper ways to do that, please refer to the following example videos:\nTabLeft Workshop - \"TIP: Drill down the center of bar stock\"\nEmbrace Racing - \"How To End Drill Round Stock (Long Rods Without a Lathe!)\"\nDusty Guy - \"Drill and Tap on a Lathe\"\nThomas Fox - \"Drilling Round Stock Without a Lathe - Making a Microphone Thread Adapter.\"\nAnd if you want to wing it, you can do it like me. Remember that I had a centered divet at the end of the wand thanks to the lathe's tailstock? I made use of that and started drilling a hole into the wand with a 4mm wood drill bit first, drilling as deep as I can with the drill bit. I left the wand on the drill bit and slowly spun it with the drill, checking if it wobbled or not. Noting that I switched to the next drill bit, 0.5mm larger and slowly started drilling into the previously drilled hole while pressing down on the drill bit from the wobble direction (basically if the wand previously tilted up, I now pressed that side down a bit while drilling). I repeated that process in 0.5mm increments until I ended up with a pretty well-centered 9mm hole, 1mm larger than I need it to so that any remaining non-centricity can be taken care of by two-part epoxy glue. Even though I pretty much winged it, it worked pretty well in the end I'd say. Just look at the chamfered testing steel rod I inserted. Beautiful I say.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQA/6FL2/JO8XWT96/FQA6FL2JO8XWT96.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Wooden Wand - Woodturning, Sanding, Drilling"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "If you choose to 3D print the wand part I hope you have some sort of multimaterial printing available to you, because the polymer clay faux inlay technique won't be working for you. Your prints will probably melt trying to use this process with them. Your only hope would be a colored 2-component-putty like Green Stuff, Milliput or something like that. I think Smooth-On's Free Form Sculpt with their Uvo or Ignite pigments might work for you, but haven't tried it so it's up to you.\nNow then, the keen-eyed Whovians amongst you have probably noticed that I am technically using the wrong colors for the inlay. Romana's Sonic Screwdriver which is making up the wand part uses yellow and green highlights, as well as some black stripes. However I feel that mixing so many colors together would not look good, so I opted for TARDIS-ish blues which should fit nicely to the gem (or whatever that thing is) at the end of the 10th's Sonic Screwdriver which makes up the handle. You may say that the blues are off, too, as they are too light and you would be right in that. I do have better-fitting ones, but as I plan on staining the wood and make it darker, lighter blues will pose a nicer contrast and thus look better. At least that's the plan.\nPolymer Clay Inlays:\nUsually inlays are done by cutting grooves or even completely routing / milling out shapes or surfaces and then inlaying metal (e.g. Make: \"Wire Inlay: Inspired to Make\"), wood (e.g. The Wood Whisperer: \"Router-Based Inlay\") or other materials to sit flush with the surface. Proper inlaying is quite hard to do and requires a respectable amount of skill which I do not have acquired (yet) - so I'm going to cheat. This technique makes use of polymer clay, Fimo in this case, which is kneaded and pushed into the cut grooves generously before the wooden piece is put into the oven and baked according to the polymer clay's instructions. For Fimo that's about 110\u00b0C, which is totally safe for wood. Alternatively you can do a resin inlay as well, but that's a tad harder to do with a circumferential groove on a round object (e.g. Jonny Builds: \"DIY Farmhouse Dining Table w/ Epoxy Inlays Using Reclaimed Barnwood\", or doublereno: \"Lichtenberg Wood Burning Blue Epoxy White Oak\").\nAbout five years ago I first experimented with this technique. Back then I also used round beech stock and used a v-shaped wood carving tool to cut grooves into the wood, then filled them with Fimo. In that case for testing purposes I used brown first, then expanded with copper, silver and gold Fimo. I had also experimented with undyed and dyed wood, sanding or not sanding (after dyeing) and a few other things. I'm just mentioning this to show you that experimenting is not a waste of time, even if you can't immediately use the results. The knowledge will definitely come in handy one day. Below are three examples of this experimentation. Even if they look drawn, I assure you those are Fimo inlays. After that is the current application on the wand.\nSanding:\nBaked Fimo is fairly hard, and honestly quite a pain to sand. Curiously it is still soft enough so it can quite easily be cut with your average exacto knife. At least mine was, so I used aforementioned blade to cut away most of the excess Fimo and finally used 180 grit sandpaper to sand the Fimo down and presto, fake inlay done! The colors don't look that good yet, but that will fix itself after varnish is applied.\nStaining:\nAs I've mentioned, I want to stain the wooden wand part to make it look a bit more interesting. For this I have chosen teak wood stain, mostly because this is what I have on hand right now. Unfortunately the polymer clay soaks up wood stain as well, so the usual application method of applying it all over generously and maybe wiping the excess isn't going to cut it. Instead I use a small brush to carefully apply it and try to avoid staining the polymer clay. While a foam brush is pictured, I didn't end up using it. Excess was carefully wiped with a paper towel. After the stain has dried well I used 120, 180 and 240 grit sandpaper to remove most of the surface staining and just leave the deeper penetrating stain intact, thus exposing and highlighting the wood grain. It's a bit shoddy, but it should end up alright.

The kind you can find at dollar stores or at the home / garden decoration department of a variety of stores. It worked, they had a nice color, but they're not ideal - from a whole package of a couple hundred of them, less than 10 were actually of a useable shape and size. Not only does it take time sifting through the literal pile to find good glass stones, even when I found one I had to shape the seating specifically to match one stone. Which might be fine for wood, but will get harder with plastic. Plus, it's somewhat time-intensive. And though I put quite a bit of time into finding a finished glass stone or plastic gem of the right size and shape which can easily be ordered my search was not successful. For an easy-to-replicate (mostly) 3D printed Sonic Screwdriver Wand these options are thus not viable.\nTherefore I have decided to model the gem myself, prepare it accordingly, make a mold and then cast it.\nThe Design and Print:\nIn my design the seating allows for a 20mm gemstone, tops. As 3D prints rarely are exactly accurate I have added a 0.2mm offset, resulting in a 19.6mm gemstone of approximately 6.4mm height. That's the \"ideal\" size, if you will.\nTo make it easier to create a master for molding and to account for sanding I have resized the stone a bit to 20mm diameter, approximately 7.6mm height and added an 8mm diameter, 15mm long shaft at the bottom. You'll see why in a minute. Now the idea is of course to take that molding master, sand it down to approximately 19.6 - 19.8mm diameter, get it as smooth as possible (removing the layer lines of the print as best as possible), make a mold and then cast copies from resin. Now then, doing all that work for a single molding master isn't really worth it, it also makes getting new copies a very slow process given that most of the resins I use have a 24-48 hour demolding time. Plus mixing up small batches of resin is harder to do than mixing bigger ones, so I opted to make 10 at the same time.\nTo make my life easier I printed the molding master at 0.1mm with 5 shells to have something to sand down and to retain some stability while keeping the layer lines reasonably minimal. I don't remember if I used 20 or 25% infill, but that's not that critical anyway. I printed the parts upright like mushrooms and used supports for the \"cap\", that is the underside of the gem part. How good the bottom side looks is not that important though, so don't stress about it if it doesn't look amazing.\nYou can find the STL files for this molding master at the end of this instructable with the other STLs. I have also added a stand-in for the cap with a hole to check the seating of your sanded gem if you don't have calipers.\nIf you print the molding master with a translucent filament you might merely need to go through the sanding and not need to make a mold. You'll probably want to go for 100% infill, or use some sort of interesting infill pattern. I'm sure it is possible to do some amazing combinations there. If you go this route, do drop me a message because I'd very much like to know if and how well that turned out.\nShaping and Sanding:\nInitially I thought I went about this the smart way. Remember the 15mm shaft I added at the bottom side of the molding masters? That's there to clamp the parts into a drill and have it spin the part, thus making the sanding much, much easier. No way I'm going to sand them all by hand, I'd definitely ruin the shape that way! Plus, it'd ruin my wrist for sure.\nSo for each master I chucked it into the drill, spun it up and then went to town with wet sanding. This is very, very important: PLA and other filaments have fairly low melting temperatures, and even lower temperatures at which they get soft and gunk up your sandpaper, or get an absolutely horrid finish from slightly melting during sanding. Wet sanding keeps the temperature of the part below 100\u00b0C as the water soaks up the heat and evaporates if it exceeds that temperature, making room for more water. Therefore when sanding 3D printed parts, use wet sanding whenever possible! Also remember to use proper safety equipment, safety goggles if you're using the drill method as parts may get sent flying and a dust mask for the sanding (even if wet sanding produces far less dust).\nI started with 120 grit sandpaper and, where necessary, a fine metalworking file to get the initial diameter right. Checking with calipers every now and then I made sure the parts ended up at about 19.7 to 19.8mm diameter, and of course that the dome part was properly smoothed with the sandpaper. I continued with 180, 280 and 320 grit sandpaper, ending up somewhere around 19.6 to 19.7mm diameter. At that point I hit the parts with two light coats of spray-on varnish, giving it some time to dry between layers and more time to fully dry before moving on with sanding. 400, 600 and finally 1000 grit sandpaper completed the \"regular\" wet sanding part and were rounded off with two more light coats of spray-on varnish.\nWhile the parts were definitely pretty smooth, it's at this point where the real fun started. I had gotten myself a set of MicroMesh, which is this amazing sanding stuff with absurdly fine grits. You can use these to bring varnish, resin and other stuff to a shine that's hard to believe. As recommended by the manufacturer I started with the 1500 one (which is actually somewhere between 600 and 800 grit regular sandpaper, on the Euro scale at least). From there I just went through all 8 remaining pads of the series, 1800, 2400, 3200, 3600, 4000, 6000, 8000 and 12000. Once that was done I used a small hacksaw to saw off the stem and sanded the bottom side somewhat flat on a file. It merely needs to be good enough for the glue to stick when making the mold after all. If you're printing with translucent filament and want to use the result directly, do put in a bit more effort into finishing the bottom side.\nAnd I did that for all 10 molding masters. I mean, 1, 10, where's the difference anyway? Yeah... in hindsight the\ndifference was between being done in 2 or 3 hours, and being done in more like 12 to 14 hours and getting an aching back from being hunched over those molding masters, sanding them to absurd levels. My reasoning for all that hard work is that moldmaking silicone can have an insanely good resolution, down to the point of being able to pick up fingerprints on your parts. As I don't want to spend time sanding each and every cast gem copy, I figured I'd put in the work beforehand, making the masters as smooth as possible, to get a really smooth mold and in turn really smooth resin copies which don't need any finishing. Maybe a light hit on the polishing wheel with a smidgen polishing paste, tops. You can see the results in the following pictures. While they really don't do the sheer smoothness any justice, I hope you can see my efforts in them anyway. In the second and third image you can see the direct comparison between a finished one and one basically fresh of the printer with just the supports removed.\nMoldmaking:\nThe moldmaking itself is actually pretty simple. I laid out the masters to take up a reasonably small amount of space and measured out the size I needed for them which turned out to be approximately 10 by 15cm. I used foamboard and a hot glue gun to quickly make a mold box with that as its internal measurements. As the height of the mold will not be that high, foamboard is plenty stable to hold out well.\nAs you can see in the second picture I used more hot glue to seal the inside seams of the mold box pretty well to prevent any leaks. The edges and corners of the mold won't be looking too good, but who cares? Once the box was constructed I marked out a grid pattern for the positioning of the masters, then tacked them down with some crazy glue. I didn't need a perfect seal around the bottom as I can simply remove any silicone that gets under it or even outright chamfer the silicone mold later due to the molding masters being taller than the actual gems I plan on casting (by not filling up the molds to the brim with resin).\nAs for the silicone itself, I basically followed the manufacturer's instructions for the ratio of silicone and hardener, mixed it up well, poured the silicone and then let it rest for twice the recommended time before demolding just in case. I am happy to say that the mold turned out quite well, as you can see under the casting section.\nBy the way, if you're new to molding and casting I can recommend the following sites and videos:\nInstructables' \"Mold Making & Casting Class\" by Paige Russell\nPunished Props Academy's \"Molding & Casting 101\" playlist\nA bunch of videos on Tested, such as \"How To Make Resin Copies of 3D-Printed Figures\", \"How to Mold and Cast a Lightsaber!\", \"How To Mold and Cast Foam Props!\" and \"How To Make a Silicone Brush-Up Mold!\" (and more)\nI Like to Make Stuff - \"Mold and cast an action figure ( or anything ) // How-To\" and \"How to 3d Print & Cast a Neon Sign\"\nAlso, don't scrape the containers when pouring the silicone or resin - the stuff on the walls is mostly badly mixed and won't cure properly, potentially messing up your molds / casts!\nMolding and casting stuff has a shelf life which may be surprisingly short - keep that in mind! You'll see why when you read on.\nStir well and thoroughly. I mean it.\nCasting and Finishing Touches:\nNow this here is a sad story indeed. It really didn't get off to a good start at all. Those who know me personally know that I'm a bit of a tool and maybe material hoarder. I buy such stuff all the time, and it tends to sit on my proverbial (and literal) shelves until actually needed. In the case of casting resins I have, over time, bought a couple different ones and used them for a project or two, but by far not all of it. While the mold was curing I wanted to perform some quick-ish tests to determine how much dye I need to add for a nice and proper gem look.\nSo I prepared a simple grid mold with foamboard and hot glue, set up all my mixing stuff, grab the first can of resin, pop it open, try to pout it and ... nothing. But the can is heavy, so what's the problem? Yeah, so, remember the bit about shelf life? It completely cured. 30 bucks of resin, a solid block now. Damn. I peeled the can around it to extract it as a single piece and maybe, just maybe be able to use it for some project or other in the future. Or just to use it as a fairly expensive paperweight.\nNo matter, get the next can of a different resin, open it up, try to pour it and ... dammit. Not again. Some poking and can peeling later I'm effectively another 30 bucks or so poorer and one paperweight richer. Somehow I'm beginning to think I should call it a day and return to it after a good night's sleep. At the very least I really should stop buying more resin than I need for a given project and perhaps extend that to other stuff with a shelf life date on it. For your entertainment I've added a picture of the two offending blocks of resin, by the way. As us German folks say, \"Schadenfreude ist die sch\u00f6nste Freude\", so do enjoy the image. Hit up google translate if you don't get it.\nBut no, I'm not calling it quits yet! Third time's the charm, after all! So going for my third and last (!) can of resin I shake it and hear the glorious sound of slushing liquid. A good sign, I say! My calculations determined that to completely fill the gem mold I'm going to need approximately 15-25ml of resin. Account for some stuck on the walls of the mixing cup which will be wasted, I mixed up a test batch of 40ml. Once I get the right figure for the dye, I'll just halve the amount, mix up 20ml and I should be golden. Next, I added a mere three tiny drops of the only blue resin dye my local material supply shop carries, \"signal blue\". I thought it prudent to slowly work my way towards the right gem color. My intention was to start lightly, pour one sample, add another drop of dye, stir, pour and repeat. I even thought long and hard about the scheme to calculate back the dye concentration at each step to be able to determine the number of drops needed with a full 40ml batch of resin to get similar results! Anyway, I stir the three drops up aaaaand its basically an opaque, crappy blue. Totally overdosed on the dye. Damn. Alright, finish mixing it, pour the stuff into the test mold, mix up another batch, this time putting a drop of dye onto a paper towel and using the stir stick to take up only a small bit of it, mixing the next batch up. It's a little too light, so I repeat the process to get to a decent strength, pour it and from the looks of it, the dye is absolutely and 100% unuseable for my purposes as the color / look isn't even remotely close to what I want it to be. I can't get that gem look I want if my life depended on it, the color just isn't right even with an acceptable translucency. It is possible that the dye is simple meant to be opaque instead of the desired translucent, but the package just doesn't say. Damn. More Schadenfreude for you, I guess, see the picture of my failure. At least the test mold box' crappy looks fit the results of the dye tests.\nYou know what they say about getting your hopes up ... so screw it, I'm getting some pre-dyed resin and be done with it for now. So next day I went to my supply store and got this pre-dyed version of the same clear resin I've been using for my coloring experiments. According to the package, it's meant to look like lapis lazuli which, should it be translucent, would be a pretty good color.\nBack to the mold - after about twice the recommended demolding time I took the mold box apart and the silicone has cured well. Despite not using any mold release for fear of lowering the quality of my surface finish, all masters demolded easily. It's a good thing silicone sticks to almost nothing but itself. Now as I have expected, the edges of the mold look downright horrible due to the hot glue used for sealing the inside of the mold box. There was also quite a bit of silicone leakage under the masters, or flashing if you will. I removed that with a razor blade, cutting all around each of the individual gem domes. This left a pretty jagged and ugly edge as well, so all in all my mold won't win any beauty contests - but on the inside, oh, on the inside it's beautiful. Perfectly smooth surfaces, and not a single air pocket in sight. At this point I'm itching to try it out and disregard the manufacturer's instruction to let it sit for a couple days after demolding for reasons I forgot. Also, the deadline for a contest I'm handing this instructable into is approaching and I can't afford to waste much more time.\nIn order to try it out I've mixed up a batch of 15ml of the pre-dyed resin according to the manufacturer's instructions and as it turns out, that's pretty much the perfect amount. The uncured color looks good, too. From that previous cured-resin and poor-dye-color fiasco I'm still a bit wary, but I think I'm tentatively hopeful that this will work out. If it does it'll also be super easy to make more of the gems as the resin is pre-mixed anyway, so no way to screw the color up. I do feel obliged to mention that I have not used any mold seperation agent here either - no petroleum jelly, no talcum powder, no liquid or spray-on separation agent. I fear this might ruin my finish, so I have not applied any and accept that the longievity of the mold will suffer. On the other hand, I'm not expecting to make hundreds of these gems anyway and if the mold degrades too much I can still make another one as I will keep the masters anyway. This might screw me over, so fingers crossed!\nFirst, the good news: The castings came our amazingly well, both in terms of color and in terms of finish. I'll have very little work left to do on them, just flattening the bottom side and going over with some acrylic polishing compound with a polishing wheel ought to be enough.\nThe bad news is that I have already noticed some minimal tearout in some parts of the mold. I did expect shortened mold lifetime from not using a mold release, but this feels exceptionally quick (good silicone molds last for 50-100+ castings). Maybe the super-smooth surface is especially good at grabbing to the resin? In any case, should I have to recast for some reasons I will use a mold release to minimize further damages to the mold. A liquid or spray-on one should do the trick.\nAs the deadline for the contes I'm handing this instructable in to is approaching frighteningly fast I have opted to skip over finishing every single casting, especially since I technically only need one for now. For illustration purposes I have finished up three to compare those against unpolished castings. The bottom side was mostly sanded flat using a fine metalworking file, then with wet sanding on 120, 180, 280 and 320 grit sandpaper and both sides recieved some quality time with a polishing wheel and acrylic polishing compound. What's left is to attach some self-adhesive aluminium (also known as aluminium tape) to the back of the crystal gem so it reflects a bit more light and looks nicer and I am finally done with this part of the build. Below are some examples; the bottom row is as cast, the top row has recieved the finishing touches described above. Funnily enough the 'polished' ones are a bit less shiny, but don't have any surface blemishes anymore. I'd say the tradeoff is worth it and it's good enough for the given purpose.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FI7/NPFK/JOMTJBWP/FI7NPFKJOMTJBWP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Gem Masters, Molding and Casting"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "As I have already made the wand part (Romana's Sonic Screwdriver) from wood and the gem / crystal is cast from resin, the next missing parts would be the grip in the form of 10th Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver and the metal rod. Beginning with the Sonic Screwdriver, to make life a bit easier for me I decided to go for the version where it's split in half and has a bore to accomodate for the steel rod. If you go back to the Design part of this instructable you'll know that I have chosen file type \"E: Four pieces, wand and grip cut in half for easier printing, all with a bore to allow for a 22cm, 8mm diameter rod to be used for connecting the pieces\" which you can find at the end of this instructable.\nPrinting the Pieces:\nGenerally to minimize cleanup as much as possible I print with 0.1mm layer height, which is important as I am printing with PLA and there's few convenient ways of finishing prints (such as acetone vapor smoothing for ABS). To have a bit of material for sanding while maintaining part stability I typically go for 5 shells (and top / bottom layers). In this case as some of the walls may be a bit thin I went for an infill of 30% instead of my usual 20-25%. This ougth to be sufficient, I think.\nFor the Sonic Screwdriver / Grip part and the moldmaking gem / crystal I have additionally enabled supports and a 5mm brim. The supports are of course for overhanging structures which are hard to avoid and the brim is due to the split Sonic Screwdriver being fairly large and flat. The brim tends to keep parts from lifting up from the print bed.\nMost other parts should not necessarily require the usage of supports or a brim. In all cases it won't use much filament at all, so it should be fine.\nBelow you can see the E-Series Sonic Screwdriver grip halves basically fresh off the printer, I have merely removed the brim and supports roughly. The parts still need a good cleanup before being glued together. As they are right now they don't quite fit together and when they're pressed together the metal rod can't be inserted as remains of the supports are still sticking out in the bore channel.\nCleanup:\nI have printed the parts in PLA, so there's no good way around finishing them except putting some spit and backbone into it, which means more sanding. No vapor smoothing for me, oh no. Just manual labor. I'm beginning to think this instructable should've been titled \"Sanding: The Instructable!\" as I feel that's all I'm doing. Time-wise it might actually exceed 30% of the project time and feel at least like 50%. But I still have some tricks up my sleeve to at least make it bearable, so I'm going to share them with you in due time. Hint: We're going to cheat. We're partners in crime now, no way out of it.\nThe general concept is to finish the inside and hard-to-reach areas of the halves, then glue them together, take care of the seams, then sand it all flush to be ready for primer painting.\nThinking about it in order, the first thing that needs to be taken care of is the remains of the support in the inside channel / bore for the steel rod. I use rounded carving chisels / knives (straight gouge chisel) to get rid of most of it, but a round file will do as well. Wrapping the steel rod with sandpaper and using the steel rod kind of like a file or form-fitting sanding block works quite well, too. For the blunt end in the cap you can press the sandpaper-wrapped steel rod in and just twist and turn it. Remember to change the sandpaper quite often as it gets clogged up. Also, wet sanding to prevent overheating the PLA, though it's not so important for the interior parts.\nThe supported / bridged underside of the four bars connecting the body to the cap with the gem were sanded flush with a metal file and an exacto blade was used to take care of the resulting burr.\nMoving on, remains of the brim and other artifacts along the perimeter of the flat side (which includes the edge to the bore for the steel rod) need to be removed. For this I mostly used a dedicated deburring tool as well as an exacto knife. This may result in a small chamfer, but that will get filled in later when taking care of the separation seam.\nWith the hard-to-reach areas mostly done the flat sides can be prepared for glueing by sanding them with something like 120 grit sandpaper on a flat surface to make sure they're really flat as well as for giving the glue something to grab on to. After this dry-fit the parts and insert the steel rod, making sure it fits easily. If not, go back and sand the offending parts down until they're no longer a problem.\nAs for cutting the rod, you can probably use a hacksaw, cutoff wheel, bandsaw or any number of utensils to do it. If you're This Old Tony, Bruce Lee or Chuck Norris a simple hand chop will be sufficient. Jokes aside, I trust that you can do it. I used a chop saw with a cutoff wheel for a nice 90\u00b0 angle. Which isn't important, but I like it. Furthermore I fixed the rod into a drill and turned it while using a metal file to add a chamfer to it, but that's not really necessary as no one's going to see either end anyway. Except you of course, looking at the pictures here.\nBy the way, if you use the solid parts with a bore and the rod doesn't fit, you likely don't have drill bits long enough to drill it out / widen the bore. You can probably use a trick by Matthias Wandel to get the rod in though. Just check his video \"Making wood thread taps\". It's super simple and should work well with plastic. The end that's being used to attach the wand part won't be visible anyway so you can cut grooves into that one. It'll also give the glue more surface area to grab on to, so it's a win-win.\nGlueing:\nAt this point the two halves can be joined together. My glue of choice for this is 2-part epoxy, preferably a quick-setting one. It dries quickly, can be filed and sanded and it's super strong. This is also where we're taking the most important steps to make our lives easier down the line (read: where we're setting up the cheating part). The Sonic Screwdriver is a mostly round object with, in this design, a central bore axis where the steel rod gets inserted. That rod conventiently extends past the tip of the screwdriver, which we'll be making use of later.\nAs I have repeatedly stated like a broken record I am using a steel rod and want to preserve the color of the exposed part near the back end, so when dry-fitting the parts I prepared a fairly exact bit of masking tape to cover that section up so glue and paint won't mess it up. With these preparations done I put down some plastic wrap to prevent any dripping of glue onto my work surface as well as two overlapping strips of packing tape which will serve as my temporary glue mixing surface. It's a neat trick for mixing up 2-part epoxy and such. As for the mixing itself, a popsicle stick with an angled, flat-cut side as well as a similarily prepared toothpick is used. Besides mixing these handy tools are also used to smear the inside bore of both halves as well as the flat parts with glue before carefully inserting the steel rod, sandwiching it in and then using clamps to hold everything in position while the epoxy cures. I made sure all the parts line up well and let it sit for two or three times the recommended amount of time. Surplus epoxy is used along with the squeezeout to build up a layer of epoxy around the seam, thus masking it off for now. After it cured I turned the Sonic Screwdriver around, mixed up a bit more epoxy and treated the other seam similarily.\nMore Sanding:\nWith everything dried / cured / hardened an old exacto blade (broken tip, but not dull) is used to get rid of most of the excess epoxy glue around the seams. If you take off too much, just apply some once more or use any combination of crazy glue and zip kicker, baking soda or baby / talcum powder (last one takes some time to set, but it's a nice, solid texture depending on the mixture, see Tested: \"Shop Tips: Mixing Superglue and Baby Powder\"). A small metalworking file may also be used to remove most of the excess glue, but be sure to clean it regularly with a wire brush and / or an old exacto blade or something similar to keep the cutting teeth clean and in working order. A gunked-up file is next to useless.\nNext we can use the cheat I have hinted at multiple times - using the exposed steel rod to chuck the Sonic Screwdriver into a drill, spin it up and easily sand most of the areas. Again, this is only possible because the Sonic Screwdriver is mostly round without many parts sticking out and we have our steel rod as a central axis, otherwise it'd be a lot more manual labor. The part is then wet sanded as much as possible while spinning and unreachable areas are then sanded manually (wet, if possible). The smoother the part gets, the better, but it doesn't have to go anywhere near the ridiculous levels of the gems / crystal. With the approaching deadline I've settled for 120 grit sandpaper which should be good enough for the primer. While layer lines can still be seen, they can't be felt anymore, so it ought to be fine. If it isn't, I'll go back in with more and / or finer sandpaper. Hindsight note: ~240-320 grit would've been a bit better.\nTo make your sanding life a bit easier, here's a few of the tools I've been using (which you can also see a couple pictures above):\nWet sandpaper, various grits\n(Small) Metalworking / modelmaking files\nFoam- or wood-backed nail files. You can get these at most drugstores and they're pretty neat as they're easy to handle and come in a couple different grits\nNail file sticks. Again, same aisle at the drugstore. With these you can get into the tiny corners you can't reach with regular sanding implements\nPopsicle stick with glued-on sandpaper. Easy to make and adapt to your needs.\nCustom sandpaper holders. I've printed this 1cm-wide version designed by workshopbob on thingiverse. There's a whole bunch of different designs to choose from on thingiverse, so take a look around.\nExacto blades. Less for sanding, but can be used to quickly remove or scrape off excess material.\nDeburring tool\nVarious carving knives / chisels. I think these are meant for linoleum, but they're sharp and work with PLA just fine.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPA/OYHZ/JOOO1BYN/FPAOYHZJOOO1BYN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: 3D Printing, Glueing, Sanding"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Painting:\nBefore I start let me remind you to use proper protective gear, especially a decent respirator / filter mask, as well as to work in a well-ventilated area. And if you're using a respirator mask and don't remember when you last changed your filters, this is your reminder to do it now.\nWith the rod acting as a painting handle I quickly made a stand out of cardboard and some tape to hold it in place for the paint to dry. Talking about the painting, my concept is masking the steel rod, then go for grey primer, black basecoat for the non-marble parts (masking the marble parts), silver for the metal-ish parts (keeping the marble parts masked, additionally masking the black front cap), finally a white basecoat for the marble part, all in that order. The rest will be done with acrylic paints. Let's see how it works out. At this point in time your guess is as good as mine.\nFor starters after two fairly heavy layers of grey primer the layer lines are still pretty apparent, so it's time for sanding. Again. After letting the paint dry (accelerated with a hair dryer) 180 grit sandpaper is used to sand the Sonic Wand once more. Two more heavy-ish layers of primer, some touch-up sanding with 320 grit sandpaper to follow. Finally about 3 or 4 more light layers of primer as a finish. It's not perfect, some of the layer lines and parts of the separation line can still be seen but as my time is running out I can't be too picky now. 'Good enough' will need to suffice. At this point I let the paint sit for an hour to fully dry / harden (and ventilate the premises properly) before applying masking tape and moving on to the next step: black basecoating.\nThere's nothing much to say at this time except for maybe to carefully apply the masking tape to get clean lines. Maybe using high-quality masking tape instead of the cheap stuff I've got at a discounter a couple of years ago. Oh, and whoever first thought to use a hair dryer to get paint to dry quicker was a bloody genious. I learned the trick from Adam Savage's videos on tested (website / youtube, very much worth a visit, especially the One Day Builds and Shop Tips). You can apply multiple paint layers so quickly with this method! No wonder modelmakers all around the world use this technique. To think I've spent so much time pretty much literally watching paint dry. No more!\nJust be a bit careful with the hair dryer and PLA, don't dwell too long in one spot or get too close as you might either damage the paint or the print itself.\nAnyway, layer and separation lines still show through, but with each layer of paint it gets better and most of it can be passed off as 'texture' by now. Hooray for me! I mean, just as planned! Next up is letting the paint fully dry for another hour, then super-carefully masking off the black cap part before moving on to silver paint for the metal parts.\nThe silver paint went pretty uneventful as well. More masking, more spraying, more drying. Not as shiny as it could be, but I didn't have any high-quality chrome paint at hand and learning from the solidified resin fiasco I kind of want to use up what I have first. Plus, for a really shiny chrome finish you need an expertly prepared surface as well, meaning it has to be suuuper smooth (which mine isn't) with good basecoats. If you're interested, Bill Doran from Punished Props has an article of chroming parts with Allclad Lacquer on Tested, which is apparently industry-leading or something. Adam Savage on the other hand swears on Molotow Liquid Chrome, which he also uses in his video on Tested: \"Adam Savage's One Day Builds: Mortal Engines Hand Cannon!\" where he finishes a 3D-printed prop firearm.\nNext one's going to be interesting as I'll have to peel off the current masking and apply new ones.\nThe peeling went pretty well, only minor chipout and paint creep under the masking tape. Nothing that can't be touched up later with acrylic paints. New tape was applied to mask off the non-marble-parts and white base paint was used to create a base for the marbling, which I already dread as my painting skills are quite underdeveloped and marbling is fairly ambitious for me. By the way, in the picture below it looks grey-ish, but that's because the paint isn't quite dry yet. It really is white as you'll see a bit later.\nThat went unexpectedly well. All the masking tape peeled off without any problems, and the layers upon layers of paint are thick enough to almost completely mask any remaining layer lines of the 3D print as well as the separation line of the halves. I specifically focused on the separation line in the picture below, and there's only a few places where you can see it. If you don't exactly know what to look for, it's not noticeable. In order to protect the sprayed paint before moving on to acrylics I gave the whole Sonic Screwdriver two or three light layers of spray-on varnish. It also helps when wiping off excess acrylic paint either wet or dry without damaging the spray-painted paint layers. Now it's time to do the marbling, the detailing and maybe some very light weathering. We'll see.\nDamn, I only noticed the reflection of my lighting umbrella on the acrylic painting palette in editing. Oh well, now you know how I get soft lighting on my pictures: Shoot-through umbrellas. Not quite as good as softboxes, but a heck of a lot cheaper and typically quicker to set up, too. At the same time I noticed that I had flipped my cutting mat to the black side instead of my usual green - what a blunder. Either it's getting too late (I'm writing this at 1am to make the deadline) or the paint fumes had gotten to me. Oh and you don't need this many brushes, in fact I only used two of them - a very fine-tipped one for details, and a rather fine flathead one. I don't quite remember if it was the left or the middle one of the trio you can see here. But they are decent-quality synthetic brushes, which makes things a lot easier.\nFirst of all I removed the masking tape of the exposed steel rod part. Then I moved on with some touch-ups on the silver and black parts that were either scratched up or not colored properly. The zig-zag channel of the extendable part (of the real Sonic Screwdriver, mine doesn't move) was filled in with some black paint using a very fine brush, as was the channel for the push-button-thingy at the side. The other side channel was colored light blue, similar to the original prop. Finally it came down to marbling. I used Snobs Interiors: \"Grey Marble Effect\" as a reference, as well as some images, but in the end I just added black lines of various widths with a fine brush and after a varying amount of fairly short drying time I dabbed or wiped over it with a dry or slightly damp piece of kitchen paper. This process was repeated until I ended up with something which from a distance and while squinting and being almost blind just might resemble marble. Being pretty much done with the detailing I'm fairly satisfied (rad: I've passed the 'Good enough!' threshold) so I think I'll be skipping any weathering and move on to the assembly.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FI8/4JQ7/JOSY6E3S/FI84JQ7JOSY6E3S.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Painting (with a Bit of Sanding)"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "This almost doesn't deserve to be a step in and of itself as it's pretty easy and short compared to previous ones.\nFirst of all the gem / crystal is backed with some self-adhesive aluminium tape. Two-part epoxy is then used to glue the gem to the back of the Sonic Screwdriver and the wand part (Romana's Sonic Screwdriver) to the grip (10th Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver). Simple, isn't it? Except my wand is a bit crooked as I apparently messed up with the drilling. That's what I get for hand-drilling. Maybe I should've gone for a drilling jig? Oh well, 'good enough' and all.\nFinally, with the wand assembled varnish can be applied to make the wood pop and to protect the whole Sonic Wand as well as making it super smooth to the touch. I applied it in thin layers making sure to sand the wand between layers to get an pretty smooth finish. Though the sanding was limited to the wooden part as the printed grip was already super smooth after the layers upon layers of paint and a bunch of sanding.\nAfter the first layer of varnish I sanded with 180 grit, one more layer of varnish, sanding with 320 grit sandpaper and the last layer of varnish.\nFinally done! Now if only someone could get me a piece of clothing so I'll be free from this project in the future I'd be quite grateful.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F56/5ONN/JOSY6E4I/F565ONNJOSY6E4I.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Final Assembly & Varnish"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Here's some pictures of the finished Sonic Screwdriver Wand for your viewing pleasure.\nUnlike my regular instructable documentation pictures I've added these in a higher resolution so you can go around pixel-peeping and spotting all the small and big mistakes I made.\nHave fun and enjoy!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FE6/8WRC/JOWSUIOZ/FE68WRCJOWSUIOZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZS/C8UO/JOWSUJ4B/FZSC8UOJOWSUJ4B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0I/5L0A/JOWSUKTZ/F0I5L0AJOWSUKTZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5E/XN1M/JOWSUJE9/F5EXN1MJOWSUJE9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Q/VL8Y/JOWSUJKV/F1QVL8YJOWSUJKV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTV/G220/JOWSUJP9/FTVG220JOWSUJP9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV0/ZZB8/JOWSUJTM/FV0ZZB8JOWSUJTM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0X/CQI3/JOWSUJXK/F0XCQI3JOWSUJXK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Glory Shots"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "Remarks / Potential Improvements:\nFirst of all I am happy to say that I have fullfilled all my general goals. The wand is definitely 3D-printable and can look quite good if some effort is being put into finishing it. And though few details were added compared to the previous iteration, I think they're good ones and the serve to improve the general looks of the Sonic Wand. Adding the steel rod is a success as well I'd say - the completed wand weight something around 160g, which is about your average 5-ish-inch-smartphone weigth. It balances pretty nicely, too, with the balancing point being somewhere around the flat marbled part towards the front of the Sonic Wand.\nThe design itself might be improved a bit to resemble the real Sonic Screwdriver more and there might be some improvements to get better printability. Maybe making the connectors / braces / whatever connecting the body of the Sonic Screwdriver to the emitter part seperately printable parts which would pretty much remove the need for supports.\nIf I had printed the wand part, painting it like wood would have been hard, especially as there is no real texture there. I'll have to look into texturing the STL file to look like wood, though then the removal of seam lines and the general sanding will become much harder. I think pretty much the only good way for smoothing would then be sandblasting, but access to that is rather limited. So unless a lot of effort is put into cleanup, printing the wand smooth and learning how to paint wood-like pattern seems like the better choice. Plus, I currently don't have the spare time to look into texturing STL files / models.\nHand-drilling the wooden wand part led to it ending up crooked. That's virtually impossible with a 3D printed part. Maybe I should have printed it completely after all, but then again, the Fimo accents look really nice and aren't possible with PLA parts. A larger drill press or proper lathe might help, or designing and 3D-printing a drill guide.\nThe gems / crystals do come out quite well, but still need some finishing after demolding. I guess I could make something like a drill adapter to glue them on to with some hot glue for much easier and quicker finishing. Hot glue is, thankfully, easily removeable with some IPA / rubbing alcohol / denatured alcohol after all and should not leave any residue.\nThe painting went surprisingly well and I think the finished wand looks pretty neat. The marbling might need some improvement, maybe a few different grey-ish or even red-ish / brown-ish stains to break up the monotonous white surface. Perhaps a subtler pattern might have been better, too. And though I like how everything came together I do wonder how a properly weathered one would look like.\nAnd with this I should be free from requests to remake this wand as anyone can print it themselves, or get it done for a very reasonable price, e.g. at 3dhubs. I wouldn't mind making full or partial kits though as that doesn't take away too much from my free time which I'd like to invest into other projects if at all possible.\nSTL Files:\nNow as promised, here are the STL files of all the different versions of the Sonic Screwdriver Wand V2: Back with a FDMgeance (my initial working title which didn't make the cut).\nYou can download them here, or head over to my thingiverse account, where you'll find them under the following link:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3238594\nThat's just if you prefer to download things on thingiverse rather than instructables, for whatever reason. Keep in mind that I have added a prefix to the files grouping them together. You just need to print the files with the same prefix, and pick whichever version you like the most.\nDifferent STL file series, based on prefix:\nA: One single, solid piece of a wand with grip\nB: Two solid pieces, wand and grip\nC: Four solid pieces, wand and grip, cut in half for easier printing\nD: Two solid pieces, wand and grip, but with a bore to allow for a 22cm, 8mm diameter rod to be used for connecting the pieces\nE: Four pieces, wand and grip cut in half for easier printing, all with a bore to allow for a 22cm, 8mm diameter rod to be used for connecting the pieces\nM: Moldmaking pieces. Slightly oversized gem / crystal with a 15mm long, 8mm diameter stem for sanding and moldmaking, as well as an endcap for testing the fit of the sanded gem\nNote that the gem is always and extra piece and doesn't count here.\nFinal Remark:\nIn any case, have fun using them and as always I welcome any kind of criticism, remarks or ideas for improvements and such. If you think you have a nifty design change proposal, do tell me and I'll see if I can put it into practice. I'll also be very happy if I get to see pictures of your very own copies of this wand.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 10: Remarks, Potential Improvements & STL Files"}], "channel": ""}, {"category": "", "description": "My Daughter wants to have a superhero birthday party, what could be better than having a Wonder Woman costume for her.

Apply the first coat of resin evenly on the inside of the shield, then put the fibre glass cloth and dab the rest of resin to make sure there is no air bubbles and also all fibreglass cloth is covered with the resin. Make sure you work in the outside or well ventilated area. I used 200 ml of resin to cover the inside of the shield. I let the resin dry for 24 hours.\nOnce it dries, you will have a stronger shield. Then I apply the resin on top of the shield, this time I only use 100ml of resin because I only use the fibreglass on the inside and not on the outside. I also let it dry for 24 hours.\nThen the fun part begin, I spray pain the shield using the gold spray paint to get the shiny effect. I wanted to apply Bondo and continue with the sanding step, but because I am running out of time, I did some short cut. I printed a copy of the reference shield (inner circle) on a piece of A4 paper and then stick it to the middle of the shield.
