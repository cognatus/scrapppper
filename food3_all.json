You may be in the category of wishing you liked them. Or you love them.\nLove touching the barnacle-textured concave of their shells, the act of prying the lip open, putting the wide part of the shell against your lip and then the briny, plump sensation of the oyster in your mouth, and then finishing by sipping down the oyster \u201cliquor\u201d the tiny bit of liquid left in the bottom of the shell. I\u2019m in the latter category.\nI first tried them many years ago while working as a waitress. An older gentleman ordered a dozen, and then showed me his process of squeezing lemon, mixing horseradish cocktail sauce, pairing with wines, then advised, \u201cEat a dozen of these and then go find a man who loves you.\u201d Now though, I live near amazing oyster farms, and I don\u2019t like to add sauce. I want to know if the oyster has fruity flavor, or deep brine and taste the mineral tang to it.\nFrom shellmounds left by indigenous people to oyster pirates, a history of the San Francisco Bay could told through the history of oysters. Olympia oysters, native to the SF Bay, are slow growing. They are smaller, their shells more fragile and their taste a little gamier than commercial oysters most people are familiar with. They were wiped out by pollutants and silt dumped into the bays\u2019 tributaries during the Gold Rush. By 1911, they were essentially extinct.\nOysters that are now farm-raised along the West Coast are Pacific, Kumamoto, introduced from Japan, along with some Atlantic species. Oysters love an estuary, where fresh water from rivers meets the sea. These marvelous mollusks can EACH clean up to 50 gallons of water a day. Oyster reefs also create habitat for thousands of other sea creatures, many of which, like mussels and clams, also help filter water. Oyster beds also shape the bottom of bays so that waves break before crashing on shore, creating protection during storm surges. This allows marsh grasses to grow, and their root structure helps to stop erosion.\nThough not likely to be eaten anytime soon, the Olympia oyster is coming back to the SF Bay. The Nature Conservancy and NOAA have collaborated with local biologists and conservation groups to restore native oysters. Two reefs have been sunk in the SF Bay- one acre in San Rafael and another one south of San Mateo Bridge in Hayward. These are not to harvest for food, but rather to help clean the bay and protect against sea level rise. Another need for the reintroduction is because they may be able to survive rising acid levels in the ocean. This is known as ocean acidification.The ocean absorbs about 30% of the C02 in the atmosphere, caused in large part by fossil fuel emissions from sources like cars and coal powered factories. Scientists are now discovering that carbon is changing the chemistry of seawater, making it more acidic and less calcium available to sea creatures that grow shells. These protective coatings are becoming smaller, thinner and weaker-and it\u2019s impacting oysters along the Pacific Coast first, and hardest. For more information on this and what the oyster farmers are doing to remedy it, you can read my article, Achieving Slurpability, about what Hog Island Oyster is doing to battle ocean acidification.\nI\u2019m posting an Instructable on opening an oyster because I opened them improperly for years. When someone finally showed me how to do it the most efficient way-without stabbing my hand or breaking open shells, I was really glad and grateful. I've also been saving oyster shells and using them, so I'll be posting Instructables on this as well.", "title": "How to Open Oysters", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-To-Open-Oysters-2/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "First, wash the oyster shells.\nYou'll want to have an oyster knife with a thick, sturdy bladed.

Then simply plop out the dough onto the oiled surface of the board.\nI know it is really tempting to start playing with dough but before you start shaping the dough and creating the iconic pretzel shape first get out two cookie sheet pans then lightly oil them up with olive oil, Pam, vegetable oil or your preferred cooking method to prevent dough from sticking during the baking process. I actually used a Silpat mat on one pan and oiled the other with a quick spray of Pam. You will need the pans to hold the pretzels for the next few steps as well as for the baking process.\nNow here comes the fun part. Take the olive oil and pour some in your hands and rub them together. Now take your big mound of dough and split it up into about fist sized balls, I got 9 balls out of my dough. Next return all but one of the dough balls to your oiled bowl because unless you have a really large cutting board you will not be able to roll out all the pretzels. Be sure to look at the pictures if you are feeling confused because I tried to make it as easy as possible visually to follow each step in making the dough into the pretzel shape.\nTake that ball of dough left on the cutting boards and start rolling out into a long strip/rope of dough.

Stop when you have a piece about 2 feet long.\nTake the 2 ends of the dough strip and create a large U-shape.

Then pull them up and over the bottom of the U-shape curling the ends over the top and pressing them up into the bottom of the dough that makes the lower part of the U-shape.\nCongratulations you've made a ball of dough into the shape of a pretzel.

Scoop up one pretzel with the spatula and carefully lower it into the boiling water for 30 seconds. I set a timer for this part because if you leave the pretzels in the bath for too long then they will get soggy and will taste funny. Remove your spatula and use it to dunk the pretzel below the surface to make sure all of it gets covered with the water. When the 30 seconds is about to run up then take the spatula, position it underneath the pretzel and lift it out gently at the 30 second mark. Place the pretzel down on the pan it came from and repeat the process for each unbaked pretzel.\nNote if while you are bathing your pretzels you happen to drop it while taking it out of the pot and it breaks apart into bits inside the boiling water then use tongs to pull out the broken pieces.

Check for firmness of the apples by pressing lightly on the smallest pieces with the finger tip. If the piece of apple gives to the touch and the caramel is a rich golden colour, then the tart is ready for the next stage.\nSlide your apples carefully into your buttered baking dish, so as to keep the caramelised side on the bottom.\nYou can then make the pastry, this allows time for the apples to cool slightly so as not to 'melt' the crust.\nRub the butter and flour to a breadcrumb texture, mix in the sugar and add the egg.\nKnead ingredients together quickly with the hands and add as much of the water as needed to make a stiff dough.

Get your fishing license and set out some crab traps! If you've got a boat, or a friend with a boat, this should be easy. If not, consider getting a free boat.\n\n2) Buy a fresh crab. Your local farmers' market might have a fresh crab stand; I got mine at the Oakland Grand Lake market. Seafood shops, yuppie grocers, and asian grocery stores may also carry fresh crab.\n\n3) Buy a pre-cooked crab. This is sub-optimal, but will certainly do if you really can't find a live source or don't want to deal with live pinchers. In any case proceed to step 4 to clean your crab.\n\nNote that a happy crab will be active and feisty when disturbed. Pick him* up with tongs or carefully with your hands, making sure to grab at the back of the shell. The crab can reach pretty far back under his body to pinch, but your upper fingers are quite safe. You can also grab hold of a couple of back legs on either side to immobilize your crab, but be careful not to break them off.\n*you're only allowed to keep and eat the males", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7L/TKBL/W7OEWZMGVMK/F7LTKBLW7OEWZMGVMK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTO/Y0S4/52OEWZMGVKB/FTOY0S452OEWZMGVKB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1T/JQ89/SIAEWZMGUR6/F1TJQ89SIAEWZMGUR6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Get a Fresh Crab"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Steam or boil your crab at ~7-8 minutes/pound, lid on but cocked to allow a bit of venting. I chose to steam mine because I've got a large steamer insert, and steam decreases the amount of water retained in the body cavity. Boiling will get the job done quite well, though, and more people are likely to have a big pot than a big steamer.\n\nIf you're adding a large number of crabs, start your timer when the water comes back to a boil. Base your number of minutes on the average crab weight, not the sum total.\n\nRound times down whenever necessary; raw/undercooked crabs can always be cooked further, while overcooked rubbery crab is unsalvageable. Thankfully there's a decent margin for error in crab-cooking.\n\nIf you're boiling, you can add some seasonings to your water. Add salt (or use sea water), a bay leaf, some celery chunks, a carrot, some pepper corns, and any other whole spices you've got sitting around. Pre-mixed crab boil seasonings are available, but not necessary.\n\nNOTES FROM THE COMMENTS:\n\n- Take advantage of their cold-bloodedness! Chilling the crabs in the fridge or freezer just before use will slow their metabolism down enough that you can handle them easily.\n\n- You can clean your Dungeness crabs before cooking. This keeps the mess out of the pot and allows for more crabs in the space. Just pre-chill your crab as described above, follow the instructions from steps 3-9, then cook according to this step's directions. However, this approach does require vivisection, which freaks some people out even if the crabs aren't moving. Take your pick. Also, if you've pre-cleaned and halved your crabs, re-weigh the parts (average weight of each half-crab) to determine cooking time.\n- many countries/states require you to take your crabs home before breaking them down, so they can be checked for legal size by any passing fisheries officer.

Now turn the stove on to low to medium heat. You want it barely simmering, no boiling [mine got a bit too hot at one point (started to try to boil) and the jar was trying to dance around in the pan so I turned it down until it stopped doing that]. Do not submerge the whole jar. I recommend having the water level up to the level of the honey if you can. Also, it is good to avoid having the jar sit on the bottom of the pan by using a trivet as sharpstick suggested in the comments. If you use an asparagus pot, it already has a nice basket in it you can put the jar on :)\nNote: If you put the lid on, like I did, make sure it isn't super tight, you want to make sure air can escape and the jar doesn't explode.\nLet it sit in the water for 20-30 minutes. Feel free to stir it as it sits there to help it along (probably don't want a lid on if you are going to stir it). I think mine was there for 35, but I was just being careful since it was my first time doing it. You can just set a timer and let it sit if you want. I used tongs to lift my jar up once in a while and swish the honey around to watch its progress.\nOnce you no longer see any crystals forming, you can turn it all off and take the jar out to cool. Your honey shouldn't recrystallize, but if it starts too, you can heat it up again on the stove until it looks right, then move it to a bowl of warm water. This will prevent it from cooling too fast.\nI don't know how old of honey it will work on, but if my label is right, my honey is 4 years old and I was still able to de-crystallize it. Don't judge.

This meant that a AU$10 Sushi meal is equivalent to a R100, where as in South Africa you would not pay more than R25 or $2.50 for the same Sushi meal. I also came over without employment and did not earn the local currency as yet and that meant that we had to live of our savings, and that was in Rands.\nThis whole situation forced us to become more aware of every cent we use and subsequently, we simply stayed away from any restaurants and take away foods. That also meant that I couldn't enjoy Sushi that I loved so much. After a year without Sushi, I decided to check out how I could make my own and if it will be cheaper by making it myself.\nI tried the conventional way of making Sushi with the bamboo mat and it worked (almost), but this method requires a lot of practice.

Have your measuring implement ready to go. Fill it with the water on the boil and immediately add it to the flour.\n4- Quickly mix it together with a spoon until it starts to form a ball. At this stage continue mixing and kneading with your hands until it reaches a play-doh like consistency.\n5- Add the brown sugar to the boiling water, stirring until it is dissolved. Set about a quarter of this aside in a separate bowl and allow to cool in the fridge. This will be used for our pearls once cooked.\n\nThe reason the water needs to be boiling is because it will not form the right consistency with just hot or cold water.

In the European Union it is also used as food colorant (known as additive E153). You can buy activated charcoal at the pharmacy.\nSo far I made the black burgers two times, I used two different products: charcoal tablets and charcoal powder. I bought both at local pharmacies. The recipe worked with both, but I recommend the powdered charcoal, it's easier to handle and also cheaper (50 grams where about six or seven Euros). The tablets also gave the burgers a slightly sandy mouth feel (The tablets consist of charcoal, bentonite and cornstarch, I think the bentonite caused the sandyness...)\nWhen I bought the charcoal I asked the pharmacists about side effects and they told me to keep in mind, that medicinal charcoal could interfere with other medication and cause constipation.\nWhich means: If you or your guests takes medication you probably should skip the purgatory burgers (or talk to a pharmacist/doctor first)\nPeople with digestive problems probably should as well rather stick to burgers from heaven...\n(If you follow the recipe you consume 1,25 grams charcoal in one burger.\n- to treat poisoning with charcoal you have to consume 0,5 to 1 gram per kilo of your bodyweight (for example a 150 pound person would have to consume between 35 and 70 grams of charcoal...\n- for treating diarrhea the daily dose is 1,5 to 4 grams)\nI never had any trouble after eating purgatory burgers (but I never had more than two at a time).\nIf you are concerned about the effects of charcoal consumption you should ask your pharmacist about it.\nThese wikipedia articles may give you some information as well: Activated charcoal and Charcoal biscuit\nIMPORTANT: Please handle the charcoal powder with care.

They love crepes with nutella, but I had some pumpkin puree left over from a pumpkin bread (keep a look out for that recipe) I had made yesterday, so I figured I may as well use that as well. Nothing wrong with pumpkin in anything.\nI don't have a crepe pan so I typically use this flat pan (called a TAWA) that I bought from India. It is great for making Indian flatbreads, but works just as well for crepes. it is non-stick which makes it easier to lift and flip the crepes.

(ex: the red will be mostly grenadine. Ew.) This is more meant to be an \"oohh, aaaahhh\" party moment that comes before the really tasty, if less magical, drinks are served...\nAnd the best thing?

Mark Montano did a beautiful spooky-black-and-gold version, here on Instructables, with a special acrylic paint that you bake. I didn't want to paint, or prime the pumpkins to cover up their natural colors. I stumbled upon another type of marbling, using nail lacquer and a bucket of water. She didn't provide a video or pics of her actually doing it, just a written description, so I was eager to see what kind of horrible mess or lucky outcome would ensue. (a little of both, but mostly the former)\nI also wanted to do one or two just using Bits of Nature that we would gather from outdoors and pin on with satin pins. I ended up experimenting with more of the the pumpkins using the nail polish in an attempt to get a decent-looking one. My first one was, \"Ew.\" My second one was, \"Huh, interesting, slightly better than the last.\" And my third one was finally cool, but so round that I missed the top parts. After seeing the results, I concluded that I'd be combining these with the Bits of Nature idea to cover all that didn't look \"good\".\nFirst off, I bought some crappy polish in pearly autumn colors. What I mean by crappy is that they were maybe $3 each, rather then, the nice \"organic\" ones that we get for $8-$11. What does this mean?\n!VENTILATE! This stuff smells! I loaded up the wood stove and opened the windows.\nI filled a big pot with water. I lined the pot with 2 plastic bags to protect it.\nI dumped some or all of the colors into the pots, maybe a third of each bottle per session.(3 sessions)\nThe polish all floats on the top. I dragged just the tip(okay, at first I didn't and the skewers got covered with lacquer gunk) along all the colors, creating a marbled effect.\nPick up your pumpkin and slightly roll over the surface. That sounds like a directive. It is not. It is what I did and not necessarily the correct way. : )\nAnyway, it is amazing to watch nearly all of the polish adhere to the pumpkin!\nI feel like this would have come out better if I had a rectangular bin, the length of the circumference of the pumpkin.\nLike, way better. But I didn't go that route.\nThe whole process took no more than 10 minutes. Fast and furious. I set them on the counter on towels and let dry for about 2 hours.\n(After about one hour, surprisingly, the pumpkins didn't smell anymore.)\nDump the waste water conscientiously.

You can give the skulls as presents to the living or you can use them as offerings to the dead. Skulls are sometimes made to represent a deceased relative or friend. Other times, they are more simply reminders of death and the journey beyond.\nAdditional Artist Statement\nI had the idea to carve skulls from cheese because at the same time as Dias de Los Muertos this year in San Francisco (2014), it is also voting season. On the ballot is Proposition E, a proposed tax on sugary drinks such as soda. The tax will generate millions of dollars annually to help fight diabetes and the obesity epidemic (40% of revue goes directly to public schools, 25% to parks, 25% to Dept. of Public Health and 10% to community organizations). This means healthier communities.\nI'm drawing a connection between Dias de Los Muertos and \"Yes on Prop E\" because I have friends who've lost toes, legs, loved ones and even their lives from diabetes. Soda is the largest single source of sugar to our diet and we can't fight this epidemic alone or without policy change. Instead of ironically honoring our dead this year--and namely those who died from diabetes-related causes--with exactly the substance that brought them to their graves, I've decided to honor the dead this year with sugar-free skulls, carved from my favorite medium--cheese!\nwww.sfmilkmaid.com\nPhoto credit: Jessy Ellenberger", "title": "Sugar-Free Cheese Skulls for Dias De Los Muertos (Day of the Dead)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Cheese-Skulls-for-Dias-de-Los-Muertos-Day-of-the-D/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "First, gather the cheese.

Nice mid-century carts are way too expensive, so I made my own version with some salvaged Douglas Fir and scraps of electrical conduit. The big orange box store provided some fittings and wheels, and I was in business.\nThe structure is very simple: two parallel ladder structures are bridged with three deep shelves. Lengths of galvanized electrical conduit add lateral stability and keep things from sliding off the shelves. Two casters are paired with a stationary end for a good mix of stability and mobility.

Seat the 3 pieces of 22-1/2\" electrical conduit into the holes on one of the ladder frames. Tap the other ladder frame into/onto the ends of the conduit until they are joined. Flip the frame (carefully, it will be very wobbly) so the back is facing up. Measure, pre-drill, and pin the conduit in place with Spax screws. Seat the three shelves, starting at one end and carefully tapping into place with a hammer and a block. The shelves should be perfectly flush with the outside of each ladder frame.

But I will give you these 2 new recipes in this post. What is almond milk? This is a non-dairy, gluten-free & vegan milk, obtained from raw or soaked almond nuts, drained & well rinsed too, 4 cups of water are added.\nYou can add whatever you want with it. You can add vanilla extract, cacao powder or another sweetener like maple syrup or agave syrup. Mostly, people on the internet use 1 cup of nuts & 4 cups of filtered water. You can add more water if you like but I love using 4 cups of water because you will end up with a lovely white almond milk, just like a milk consistency. Most of the time, they tell you to soak your nuts , just add water until the nuts all completely covered by the water, soak them for at least at night or at least 8 to 72 hours in water in the fridge. Why? The nuts become less raw & they are easily digested in the stomach. When these nuts are soaked, then well-drained & rinsed, they become more useful to use in raw vegan cheesecakes, in baked desserts, in muffins or in bread. Or you can make your own vegan cheese or spread. You can make nut milk from every nut or a mix of nuts that you like & love. I am experimenting with them now. More recipes to come!\nRecipe 1: Soaked Almond milk, NOT sweetened ( This will make about 3 +3/4 cups, nearly 4 cups )\nThe almond milk,will keep about 4 to 5 days in the fridge!!!\nIngredients:\n1 cup of soaked raw almonds ( soaked in water for about 8 to 72 hours .) When you soak your nuts, place them in a bowl & pour water all over it, until they are all covered up. Place a lid on & place into the fridge for at least 1 night or at least 8 hours.

The only important ratio is that of \"size of appetite\" to \"quantity of food\".\nTo determine how much brownie mix to use, consider the size of a pan of brownies and how much of that pan you and whoever you're cooking with could realistically eat. If you could eat half a pan of brownies, use half the bag of mix, and so on. I used the same bag of mix for several two-person meals. Add enough water to make a semi-liquidy batter and one or two eggs (or roughly the equivalent amount of fake egg product). It should look like regular brownie batter. This is not rocket science. But, it has enough energy in it that you might feel like it is rocket fuel.\nNext, add the peanut butter. Peanut butter is possibly the best part of Backwoods Gourmet Brownies and the ingredient that sets it apart from regular brownies. The PB takes the place of oil in the brownie box's recipe and adds some much needed protein for energy to tackle whatever back country activity you have planned. Because PB is so deliciously useful, I keep a jar on me at all times in the back country and I have it at practically every meal. Use as much as you feel is necessary in your brownies. The flavor of PB pairs well with the chocolate in brownies, so feel free to be generous.

Don't be turned off by the muddy, sticky texture of these brownies, they are just as delicious as any brownie you might buy at the store. In fact, with the peanut butter, they are probably better. The texture of this style of brownie makes it spreadable and/or dunkable, if desired. I recommend spreading on a banana for some extra potassium to keep your muscles happy while you're active.\nAnother distinction is taste. Everything always tastes better when cooked in the back country. After hiking, biking, climbing, or skiing for a few days the simplest foods taste like some of the best meals of your life. Scrambled brownies are no exception to this rule.\nFinally, the flatware. Carrying as little as possible is key in the back country, so you won't have a full set of dishes at your disposal. Most back country meals are served straight from where they're cooked. But, when it's as delicious as these brownies, that's an advantage.

You cut the pancakes and sausage into appropriate sized bites, so that each forkful contains some sweet pancake with syrup and a little spicy salty sausage. I call this the perfect bite (PB). You get near the end and realize there will not be enough sausage to finish the pancakes. Then in a desperate attempt to avoid plain sweet bite (PSB) you ration the sausage leading to completely unfulfilling slightly not salty enough bites (SNSEB). Sure a rational person would just get up and get more sausage, but I am not that guy.\nThis is my solution to that problem. I searched before writing this Instructable, because I couldn't have been the first person to try and solve this problem. I am also lazy and hoped someone had saved me the trouble of writing this. Unfortunately, it falls on me to bring balance to the breakfast fork. So here is a simple combo to ensure every bite has the correct amount of flavors.\nSide note: If you had published an Instructable with something similar, but misspelled pancake or sausage or worse yet conflated them into some terrible new name like pansages then slap the link in the notes below and everyone will know of your superior, but slightly whiny nature.", "title": "Sausage Pancakes", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Sausage-Pancakes/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I just used a pan to cook the sausage.

Find one you like and I am confident it will work in this situation.\nThe day I made these, I used a thinner batter with an extra egg. That is how my wife likes them. My kids prefer a waffle batter pancake where you whip the egg whites before folding them into the batter. This makes a nice airy pancake. They also like German pancake, but that is entirely different and not appropriate for this recipe.\nSnobby Declaration: While it is possible that mix pancakes will work for this recipe, I say don't risk it. Pancakes have like 6 ingredients in them and require no special equipment or skills, unless you consider a bowl special equipment.\nImportant note: While most everyone will eat whatever pancakes you put in front of them, they all harbor a preference. For the first few years of marriage, I would make classic fluffy pancakes. My wife was too polite to share her deep desire for eggy thin pancakes and had to choke down what was provided. After years of this mistreatment, she politely mentioned how much she enjoyed the middle ground between pancakes and crepes.\nIt rocked my confidence and I began to question all her earnest seeming declarations of love.

It is simple to make and doesn't need much finesse. However, pressing juice out of crushed apples needs a pretty hefty force and the frame needs to be able to bear the force of a car jack (which, after all is strong enough to lift a car). It needs to be strong enough to do this without the wood breaking.\nThere are two things it needs to do:\ncontain the forces of the jack to give it something to push against\nprovide a stable platform for the vat that the fruit is contained in\nMake a basic frame\nThe basic frame is a simple square. Start by measuring the width (not length) of the vat. The wood needs to be cut to the size that, when bolted together, the vat fits inside with the length at right angles to the pressing frame (looking down). This is just so the end of the vat sticks out so you can get an overhang to put your collecting container under.\nYou should not use nails or screws for the frame joints of the press. Nails/screws are both like wedges in the wood grain. This is not good for wood you are going to put under heavy stress. You are making a bracing frame for huge forces. It needs bolts with cleanly drilled holes. Screws/nails are likely to cause a serious split when under force. This may mean the press breaks and may also be dangerous.\nUse two bolts at each joint to spread the force. Note that they are set diagonally. This means you don't get two holes in one line of grain on either piece of wood at each joint. Tighten them up very tight when bolting up. The friction of the wood being compressed together means it is not just the bolts taking the force.\nAdd a base\nThe vat needs to be on a base, so the forces are spread out evenly across it. When you use the jack it applies a pretty huge force. Without the base, the vat may tip or crack under the uneven pressure.\nThe base is just a strong board that fits the base of the container you use for a pulp vat. The container needs to be strong. I used a common storage crate. You will find that crates may have strengthening lugs on the base. My crate had these in the corners, so I had to cut out corner pieces so the board fitted.\nThe main point is that the board needs to be in contact with as much as the base of the vat as possible to spread the load.\nHowever don't make the base plate quite as long as the vat.\nThis is because the vat you put on this base board will need to have a drain hole cut in it at one end to allow the juice to escape. For this reason, it is very important that the end of the vat where you drill your hole can overhang the base board. If you don't the juice would just seep out under the vat onto the base board - not good!\nPut it all together\nOnce you have a board, attach it to the square press frame. To do this, centre the board inside the upright frame across its width and secure with screws. The board is now resting on a single plank, so add two more planks under the board, evenly spaced out. You end up with the board resting on three planks so that it is nice and stable, with the centre plank being the upright frame.\nThat's all it is.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FY3/U5BT/I0VP2NBK/FY3U5BTI0VP2NBK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZJ/57Q9/I0VP2KRW/FZJ57Q9I0VP2KRW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0O/QLJZ/I13EBXSJ/F0OQLJZI13EBXSJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1E/MP3O/I0VP2KZL/F1EMP3OI0VP2KZL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLG/VBDH/I0VP2L32/FLGVBDHI0VP2L32.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F43/F0QF/I0VP2NF5/F43F0QFI0VP2NF5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP6/7ILF/I0VP2KSY/FP67ILFI0VP2KSY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0Z/2378/I13EBXSI/F0Z2378I13EBXSI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAI/T5FC/I0VP2KTK/FAIT5FCI0VP2KTK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Making the Frame"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Now you have a press, get juicing! Here are some things I learned the hard way...\nCrushing apples is hard work\nFor every gallon of juice you make, you will typically need to have collected about 5-6 time the volume of apples to start with. However, you can't just press whole apples. You need to crush them as much as possible to release the juice.\nI quite enjoy the hard physical work, but it involves a a lot of repetitive physical pounding. This is pretty tiring. Here are some handy things I have discovered that make this easier.\nFirstly, it is worth wearing gloves when doing this to avoid blisters due to the repetitive rubbing of the wood on your skin. Leather ones are best. It's hard work and your hands can get pretty sweaty inside gloves that don't breathe (like PVC or rubber gloves).\nIt sounds obvious, but also make sure your container is watertight or your juice will leak out. Occasionally the pounding action may break the base of a container. It is worth checking the state of the base as you go along. Keep the base on flat even ground when crushing apples to avoid this.\nChopping apples with a spade\nThis technique was a revelation!\nBefore crushing apples it is best to cut the apples up first. I used to chop them up with a cleaver on a chopping board. However, they tend to fly about everywhere and this can get quite annoying. I discovered that using a spade is a much more efficient way to do this.\nA spade is essentially a big heavy blade on a stick. A guillotine if you like. If you fill your crushing container about 1/3 full of apples, you can hack them up in the container with the spade pretty quickly, without them flying about all over the place, as happens on a chopping board.\nNB- Only do this if you have a stainless steel spade - a normal steel spade may taint your juice with metallic flavours. They are quite cheap though, if you need to buy one.\nSmashing the chopped apples to a pulp with a wooden baulk\nOnce the apples are chopped up to about 1\" pieces, it's time to mash them to a pulp! This is quite good fun, but after a while it can get a bit tiresome, as it does take a lot of pounding. The easiest way is to use a length of timber (lumber).\nI have tried different sizes and found 2\"x3\" is best. Anything less thick is not heavy enough. I have experimented with larger section wood, but lifting the heavier wood repetitively is much more tiring. As you crush the apples, the pulp also starts to create suction round the wood. Lifting a large piece of wood up out of the pulp becomes quite hard because of this suction. It is worse the larger the cross-section of the wood. This upwards lifting action is also quite likely to pull a muscle in your back if you overdo it, so big pieces are not recommended.\nThe apples need to be smashed to as fine a pulp as you can to get the most juice out. As you work on them, they will start to get wet as the juice emerges.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FD9/3MZ1/HN6BL7ZT/FD93MZ1HN6BL7ZT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F58/BYYX/I13EC662/F58BYYXI13EC662.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXU/VOT7/I13EC6AA/FXUVOT7I13EC6AA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVS/XBDD/I13EC5ZW/FVSXBDDI13EC5ZW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F54/37JY/I0VP2LJL/F5437JYI0VP2LJL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Crushing Apples With the Least Effort Possible"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The press is now ready to crush the apple pulp and squeeze the juice out\nYou can't just apply the press to the raw pulp or the pulp will just squidge out the sides when you apply the force. It needs to be contained in a cloth, so it doesn't do this. Containing it also stops apple pulp clogging up the juice escape hole.\nThe cloth you use does not need to be specialist. Here you can see an old green bed sheet, which worked fine. I normally use a slightly coarser nylon mesh. If you haven't got any old cloth, the best thing is to buy is net curtain fabric off the roll. You can buy as much as you need from a haberdashers (fabric shop). It is really cheap to buy by the yard.\nPressing\nNB - before you start filling the press, put the container that you are catching the juice in underneath. Some juice comes out as soon as you put the pulp in, even before pressing. Don't waste it.\nPut the fruit vat into the press and line with the cloth, then fill with crushed pulp. Wrap the cloth round to make sure it can't escape. On top of your cloth/pulp bundle you also need the other board to spread the force of the jack out. If you don't do this, the jack will just squash a hole in the middle of the pulp but not squeeze any juice out of the rest.\nOnce you secured bundle is under the board, put your car jack between the top of the board and below the top of the frame - and get jacking!\nYou will get a lot coming out at the start, then it will slow right down. You can release the jack and re-position the cloth bundle in a different position (e.g. upside down) to get some more out.\nAfter each the juice is squuezed out of bundle of pulp, you just repeat the steps until you've got all the juice out. Note the pulp is great for composting if you grow veg.\nNote - if you are doing a lot, this will take a few hours, so be prepare to have lights if it is going to get dark as you go. Here I have the trusty head torch on.\nJuice is great, but what about cider making?\nAlthough you can just drink the juice, this press was made for cider making.

So, I decided to spice the cake up a bit with an LED \"billboard\" that would give the cake the air of being truly freeway-desert-esque...\nI had a bunch of 10mm LEDs available (from our Instructables LED build night - thanks!) plus some lithium coin cells, so I figured I'd custom-build a \"billboard\"-style sign using these parts.\n\nMaterials required:\n-10 mm LEDs\n-4x coin cell CR2032 batteries\n-20 gauge wire (for battery leads)\n-30 gauge wire (for wire-wrapping the LED leads)\n- wire wrapping tool (yay old skool styles!)\n-hot melt glue gun (tool of hacker champions)\n-bamboo skewers (for the frame, another tool of hacker champs)\nKeep in mind I had a limited time-frame for this build - it was only after the cake turned out to be below expectations did I need to add some pizzaaz to the presentation.

Why do we have candy corn kernels and not a full cob of candy corn? Clearly this is an imbalance in the world that needed to be fixed. \n\nI did a quick google search to see if someone else has stumbled upon this cob-shaped void in the universe; I was surprised at how little I found.\n\nThere was a creator that attempted to accomplish the impossible by fusing the kernels with melted chocolate. His story can be found here: http://somethingaweek.wordpress.com/2011/10/15/82-candy-corn-on-the-cob/. He was successful and made a beautiful cob of  pure sugar. \n\nI also found another attempt on youtube where a guy used icing, but ended up with a frozen block of sugar. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZKeseqwaL8\n\n\nI was looking for something easier, cheaper, and more fool proof. \n\nI experimented with fondant first, that was completely unsuccessful. Then I though of gluing it together with caramel (since I had a fresh bag of that around too). Too messy and too hard. \n\nThen, another light bulb went off.....cookie dough! Sugar cookie dough works perfectly (don't attempt with chocolate chip dough, the chips just get in the way and jeopardize structural integrity). It only took about 4 minutes to assemble and looked authentic. \n\n\nUpdate: For those afraid of the raw eggs in cookie dough, I recommend making egg-free cookie dough instead.Here is a handy recipie I found online: http://www.food.com/recipe/egg-free-no-bake-cookie-dough-for-eating-391880\n\nSecond Update: I have received a lot of recommendations to substitute marzipan instead of the cookie dough...the choice is yours :)\n\n\n\nSome helpful details:\n\nI only used about 1/10 of the tube of cookie dough for the cob core(hooray for leftover cookies!). I rolled it thinner in my hands to get the half-sized cob.  \n\nI pushed the candy corns into the cookie dough only as deep as the white part., if you push them in too deep then they start to collide in the cookie dough and cause it to loose its shape. I layered the kernels by alternating the spacing each row (length-wise). As you can see in the picture, I set the rows with the kernels flat against each other, not the longer way.\n\nAlso, I only used about half a bag of candy corn ( a lot of them were broken). So you could easily make two small cobs from one bag or one impressive full-sized cob! \n\nIts pretty stable on its own, but a quick set in the fridge really helps hold it together. It also helps to have the cookie dough chilled before pushing in the candy corns.  \n\n\n\nNow I have fixed the sugar-cob-shaped hole in my life and have a brick of sugar to eat. Although the earthy-vanilla of the sugar cookie balances out the unadulterated sweetness of the candy corn, I do not recommend eating it all at once (unless you don't want to move for a while).\n\nI could see this being a fun center piece or a part of a candy table where guests may pick off candy corns as they like.\n\nIt was a fun experiment, and its so cheap and easy I would love to see what people can do with it.

I have been dead set on using sugar beet but have found it really difficult to get hold of where I live as there are no sugar processing factories nearby. Nonetheless beetroot itself (Latin name: Beta Vulgaris) still has a very high sugar content when grown in good conditions and can even get eaten by sugar hungry wasps in some years. Using a special processing technique, I managed to get the specific gravity of the wine up to 1068, which give gave plenty of alcohol after distillation and a very useful medicinal super food bi-product with the colour and consistency of blood.\nDifficulty: ..........\nCost: ..........\nSatisfaction: ..........\nHazards: .......... Explosive ethanol fumes.

I would not personally recommend drinking the blood as it has all the undesirable flavours of the fermented beetroot, but could quite happily be poured over objects or people/animals with no ill effect. It is however, thought to be highly medicinal:\nEver since the Roman times, beetroot has been considered to have medicinal benefits including use as an aphrodisiac, treatment for fever, constipation, digestive problems and blood problems. In modern times the distinctive pigments such as betaine and indicaxanthin are thought to have even more benefits such as an anti-depressant, protection against heart disease and stroke, protection against liver disease and reduction in blood pressure. The red pigment betaine can be used as a food colouring but also is widely thought to have good anti-oxiditive properties where \u2018oxidative stress\u2019 can encourage other major illnesses such as cancer, alzheimer\u2019s, chronic fatigue etc. Recently beetroot has been described as a detoxifying superfood because of it's combination of nutritious and medicinal properties.", "title": "Elixir Vulgaris and .......

When I was about 9 years old I had a recurring dream almost every night for about 6 weeks of being in a labyrinth of dark tunnels and caves looking for a hidden garden. On the way to the garden lurked malicious monsters who would try and intimidate me, and towards the end of the 6 weeks try and attack me. The dreams got more and more vivid and scary as time went on and I began to have the feeling of being doomed to being eaten alive by monsters. Just when all seemed lost and a huge hoard of monsters were snapping at my heels as I ran petrified through the tunnels, the thought occurred to me that I had nothing to lose by turning around and fighting the monsters, even if I lost, as they were going to kill me anyway.

The last thing that I want is to get out of my warm bed at four o'clock in the morning and walk around the fields and find no rabbits.\nThere are a few things to look for and the most obvious is nice fresh droppings. These should be black and shiny. If they are brown and dry they are old and may be from a rabbit that is just passing by rather than a habitual visitor. Another thing to look for is scrape marks with little tussles of white fury 'stuff' next to them (See photo above). If these signs can be seen fresh everyday for several days in succession then it's pretty likely the rabbit is either a habitual visitor or has even taken up residence in a nearby hedgerow.\nRabbits are strongly attracted to smells and will often travel for miles to investigate a freshly ploughed field for the juicy morsels that the plough may reveal. They are also attracted to freshly mowed fields as they prefer small, young plant shoots rather than big rough tufts of grass which are much harder for them to digest. It is also much easier to spot the creatures in mowed grass as there is less cover for them to hide in.\nIf rabbits have taken up permanent residence in a hedge, you can often smell them as you walk past on a still day - they really do stink sometimes! After a while, hollows in the undergrowth should become noticeable as they start to use regular runs to get to their feeding grounds. Sometimes they will form hopping tracks which take the form of regular patches of flattened grass at hopping intervals - for this you will have to imagine you are a rabbit - a rabbit will not push through thick grass if it can just hop over it. Lastly, rabbits may leave very distinctive tracks in mud or snow - think what a rabbit's back legs look like and what mark it would leave behind. They will also periodically urinate in the snow leaving pretty little yellow patches!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Y/CYU0/I0H96IR9/F8YCYU0I0H96IR9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1X/C3CA/I0H96IRC/F1XC3CAI0H96IRC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZR/ROP6/I0H96IRD/FZRROP6I0H96IRD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIU/2CEZ/I0H96IRE/FIU2CEZI0H96IRE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Tell Tale Signs of Rabbits"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Obviously some kind of rifle is required and this could be a 'firearm' or an airgun. I started off with an airgun but found it pretty unsatisfactory as it did not have the power to get clean and humane kills unless it was at really close range such as 30 metres or less. Even then, if the rabbit was paying attention, it could hear the shot and jump out of the way before the pellet made contact, it was that slow! A 0.22 calibre rifle is a much more effective option, but there are important safety aspects to be aware of.\nRabbits prefer to feed in the hours of darkness, particularly at about an hour before sunrise. A powerful lightweight spotlight mounted on the gun is essential and will cause a bright reflection in the rabbit's eyes which makes them easy to spot if they are looking sideways on.\nTo get a humane shot a shooting stick is a really good idea. I use a lightweight photographic tripod with a home made metal V attached. Target shooting at rabbits to test your skills is not a good idea! The shooting stick is not a cheat and will make getting a steady aim ten times easier than just holding the rifle in the air.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTY/36WY/I0H96IRH/FTY36WYI0H96IRH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWC/X56G/I0H96IR8/FWCX56GI0H96IR8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Shooting Equipment"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The best policy here would be to get some experience hunting with a trained or experienced person who can explain all the possible hazards.

Personally, I did a two day training course called DSC1 in the UK, which goes into detail about the diseases animals such as rabbits may carry, what the symptoms look like and who to notify if something nasty such as TB is spotted. Rifles themselves are obviously incredibly dangerous if the hunter does not know what they are doing, so training is essential.\nMeat hygiene is another important aspect and again training is appropriate. There are online training courses which are helpful, but do not go into as much detail as the DSC1.\nLastly, all rabbits have fleas, who will be looking for a new host almost immediately after the rabbit dies.\nIf you can leave the rabbit hanging up for about 5 minutes before gutting, then the fleas will jump off into the grass rather than into your clothes!", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 3: Health and Safety"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Once it has been established that rabbits are present in a location on a daily basis, the hunter can set his alarm clock for early morning, check which way the wind is blowing and approach from a downwind position if possible. Looking at the photo above, the grassy area is where I have spotted signs of rabbits and provides a safe back stop for the shot (consult your training instructor). No person or animal should be in between the rifleman and the rabbit, so the dog would normally be 'at heel',and not in the foreground as shown.\nMove quietly and steadily watching out for sticks underfoot - if you are careful you can feel the sticks with the underside of your foot before treading on them - practise this beforehand or remove such obstacles from your path the day before. Never stamp your foot clumsily as this is identical to the rabbits alarm signal that it performs with it's back legs. Once in a predetermined suitable location, set up the shooting stick, rest the rifle on them/it and turn on the lamp. Strictly speaking, you should not scan the field with the gun, but in this situation there is no other option unless you have a companion to help out. If there are rabbits, they will react in several possible ways - they may just look back at the lamp in which case you will see their eyes, they may hop into cover, they may run away or may just ignore everything. If it's the last one then they may be diseased, the other behaviour is often entirely unpredictable. Rabbits are also curious, so may hide for a while and then peak their heads up to see what's going on, but in any case be prepared for a quick decision to take a shot.

In the past I would probably be in a hurry and not cook it for long enough so it was tough or it would be in a thin, mealy, stew with a few random chunks of vegetables. Now, for once and all, I am going to meditate on the recipe for days before hand and remedy ALL my previous mistakes!\nSo, going through the process, I spotted really good signs of rabbits in one of the fields, I stalked the rabbit at 10pm so did not even have to get up early, I shot the rabbit (there was only one), brought the rabbit home and left it outside for the fleas to hop away, REALLY PLEASED WITH MYSELF! Got up early in the morning and .............. It was gone! The fox must have got it! Now I had to think which of my neighbours had rabbit infestations and start 'phoning round. The rabbit stew simply had to be made!\nThe recipe itself is based around two basic requirements: (1) Tenderise the meat and (2) Thicken the stew with flavour. The thickness will not be created with corn flour, but juiced apples, which should also have enough intensity of flavour to compliment the extremely flavoursome rabbit. I suppose I could have just wacked it with chilli powder, black pepper, turmeric etc but that felt like cheating on this occasion. There will, however, be some spice, but not too much.\nEquipment:\n7.5 litre pan\nJuicer (BJE410 Nutri Juicer \u2122) for apples\nIngredients:\nTwo wild rabbits\n900g apples ..................................... Lots of lovely fresh apples this time of year\n750g carrots ................ Fresh, Fresh, FRESH and full of flavour.\n600g leeks\n800g small onions\n500g potatoes\n800g tomatoes\n75g fresh garlic\nTarragon ........................................... My neighbour said this was great with rabbit.\nFresh Bay leaves x 5 of\n100g kale\nGround pepper\nSalt\nProcess:\nAdd oil/fat to a large frying pan, heat until crackling and then add the pieces of rabbit and quickly brown off on both sides.\nChop and fry the onions and garlic together until caramelised (browned). This produces an utterly heavenly smell! Blink when you chop and you won't get onion juice in your eyes.\nTransfer to a large pot, add chopped vegetables, pepper, bay leaves, tarragon and chopped tomatoes.\nJuice the apples and pour into the pot to cover about 90% of the contents. (Not 100% as tomatoes are 95% liquid). Is that confusing? - Don't worry about it!\nChop up and boil the potatoes in a separate pan until cooked and strain off the water.\nBring to the boil and simmer for 2 hours or as long as it takes for the meat to fall off the bone.\nFork out the rabbit joints and peel off the meat, discarding the bones. Throw the meat back into the pot.\nSeason with salt and pepper to taste. Add kale chopped off the stalk, discarding the stalk. Add the boiled potatoes now.\nCook for a further 10 minutes and serve with more vegetables and a tablespoon of Earwig Chutney.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6K/D522/I0LCG5PR/F6KD522I0LCG5PR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIA/Y4BN/I0LCD88O/FIAY4BNI0LCD88O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA6/DHWG/I0LCD88P/FA6DHWGI0LCD88P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVE/SE0J/IEQ8RSAO/FVESE0JIEQ8RSAO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: The Recipe"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Enjoy the taste of this amazing recipe as we did!", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 7: Tasting Session"}], "channel": "Soups & Stews"}, {"category": "Food", "description": "There are several recipes for pumpkin syrup on the internet, and there's nothing wrong with them, except they are not the kind of syrup that I wanted.\nI wanted a true flavoring syrup, like they have in coffee shops and bars.

I am using a 13x9 sized glass pan and the instructions state to preheat the oven to 350-degrees.\nIngredients\nseven (7) medium apples (I used the Fuji type)\none package white or yellow cake mix (I used white for this Instructable)\none stick of unsalted butter\nYou can optionally place cinnamon over the top. I am allergic to cinnamon so I don't use it.\nPrepare the Apples\nWash the outside of the apples. I do this with running water and I would have taken a photo but my sink was full of dirty dishes at the time.\nWith a potato peeler (or whatever else you have) peel the skin off the apples. (I don't have a fancy apple peeler.)\nUsing an apple corer/slicer, core and slice the apples. You can optionally place the apple pieces in a gallon-sized plastic bag with 1/2-cup of lemon-lime soda to prevent browning. It took me about half-an-hour to peel, slice & core all seven (7) apples, so I chose to use this method to keep the apples pretty in the photos.\nCombine Ingredients and Bake\nPlace the cut apples in a greased 13x9 pan.\nAs evenly as possible, sprinkle the dry cake mix over the top of the apples.\nMelt the stick of butter. I do this by melting the butter in a microwavable container for 30-seconds in the microwave.\nSlowly pour the melted butter over the top of the cake mix.\nBake the cobbler for at least 35-minutes, until the edges are browned slightly.\nI let the cobbler cool for at least ten minutes before serving.\nOther Notes\nThe yellow cake mix will give a more cobbler look to your dish.

Even if you aren't a hunter, they start to appear at farmer's markets and grocery stores in the winter. Mushrooms like chanterelles and porcini cannot be cultivated, so they are seasonal and at times rare. Very few people are neutral about fungi-some dislike the texture and can't stand them, but for others, eating wild mushrooms is a way of tasting the earth-the leaves and branches and unfurling ferns and quivering wood orchids. For mushroom lovers, black trumpets are often the earthiest, inkiest of them all. When raw, their consistency is like a thick paper, and their scent like pure forest. I personally love them.\nChef and author Becky Selengut dropped by the Instructables kitchen at Autodesk and made a few recipes from her most recent book, Shroom, including a tart made of black trumpet mushrooms with camembert, leeks, and port-soaked cherries. I'm really glad she was there, because this is a multifaceted recipe and left to my own devices, many things could have gone wrong. But I feel prepared now to try it on my own one day. Becky advised in her book, \"This is an appetizer to serve when you really want to impress someone.\" In the kitchen, she said something more like \"Make this when you want to get _____.\" Imagine-black trumpets, cheese, bacon, boozy fruit-altogether in a tart.

They're also dead simple to make. I made them for the first time this past Friday in fact. My coworker gave me this recipe to try out because she knew us foodies were going to cook for the rest of the hackerspace.\nWhat you need:\n3 Granny Smith apples\n2 8-count cans of crescent roll dough\n1/2 cup butter\n1.5 cups sugar\n1 teaspoon cinnamon\n1 12-ounce can Mountain Dew soda\nSteps:\n1. Preheat oven to 350 and spray a 13x9 pan. (I used a nonstick pan so I didn't bother spraying)\n2. Peel and core the apples and cut them into 6 slices each. The peeling is important as I left one unpeeled (just to see what'd happen) and the skin got leathery? It didn't taste bad, it just didn't cut easily.\n3. Take a triangle of the crescent roll dough and roll a slice into it. Then put the little roll into the pan. Extra apples can be put to the side (or immediately consumed :D).You'll have 16 of the crescent roll dough triangles to use.\n4. Put them into the oven for 10 minutes. Most folks will say to pour the sauce on, then stick them in the oven, but letting them bake for 10 minutes first not only allows you time to make the sauce, but also makes the crescent dough start to bake so it doesn't get all doughy on the top where you want the dumpling to be crunchy!\n5. Melt the butter! Once the butter's melted, take it off heat and mix the sugar and cinnamon in. I mixed it very well, but you don't have to. If you do, you get an even coating, and if you don't, you get a crunchy, sugary coating on the dumplings. Also, I used brown sugar, but I've seen recipes that let you use normal white sugar as well.\n6. Once the 10 minutes are up, open the oven door, and pour the mixture evenly on the apple dumplings. I used a spoon to make sure each dumpling got at least a couple of spoonfuls. Then pour the can of Mountain Dew around the outside.\n7. Let it bake for another 35 minutes. Once that's done, serve them warm with vanilla ice cream!! You may still see the Mountain Dew sloshing around on the bottom, but as the pan cools, the dumplings themselves will soak all of that up. I didn't worry too much about it, in other words :p\nNote. The other option is to do it like most everyone else does it, and after step 3, go to step 5, and then bake for 45 minutes.

This fondant tastes like the expensive stuff but costs only a few dollars to make.\nFondant is used in cake decorating as an outside covering for your cakes. It has a slight vanilla flavor and goes over the top of your buttercream. Fondant is easily colored with food coloring and can be molded into shapes. It's easy to paint on with food coloring too. Many modern cakes are made with fondant such as the ruffle cake.\nA few tips before we start:\nThe first thing we need to do is gather our ingredients and our tools.\nIngredients:\n2 lbs sifted powered sugar (you may not use all the powered sugar depending on your area, that is okay)\n1 lb mini marshmallows (Hy-Top, Walmart brand or Haribo Brand if you can find it)\n2 tbsp water (use only 1 tbsp if it is very humid in your area) .5 cup shortening (or trex)\n1.25 lbs of Wilton fondant (if you buy the 5 lb box, use one half of one of the packages, if you buy the 1.5 lb box, use the whole package) I use my 50% or 40% off coupon to purchase my fondant at Michaels or Joanns so that the overall cost of my fondant is less. You can get these coupons online, with the app or in the newspaper.\nExtra powered sugar (for kneading) Tools Needed: Stand Mixer Large plastic bowl Spatula Dough hook for mixer - See more at: http://artisancakecompany.com/2012/11/the-best-ma...\nYou may not use all the powdered sugar depending on the humidity in your area. If your fondant is dry, subtract a cup of sugar. If it's sticky, add more sugar until it's smooth and not tacky.\nFor this recipe, it is much easier if you use a stand mixer with a dough hook. YES you can make this by hand but it's much more difficult but if that's all you got then roll up your sleeves and get to mixin'\nA scale is handy but you can mostly eyeball that part.\nThe proper marshmallows are important for this recipe and make sure you have the full 16 oz. Some bags only have 10 oz. If that is all you can find, use a bag and a half. Again, you can eyeball this.\nTo color dark colors like the black pictured, you have to subtract one tablespoon of water and replace it with food color gel, I prefer the kind from Americolor. Add the color at the same time you add the water in the mixing stage.\nMake SURE you really knead the heck out of this fondant or it will be crumbly and not stretchy. The kneading is just as important as the ingredients.", "title": "How to Make Marshmallow Fondant", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-Marshmallow-Fondant-1/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I'm super serial guys... sift that sugar or you will be sad.

The Watermelon Dreamcicle is a frozen cocktail which challenges my limited bar-tending skills to make a layered drink, whereas the Watermelon Cream Cooler is its non alcoholic, kid friendly cousin.\nBoth drinks are great as desserts after a beach-side barbecue, but could be enjoyed alone as light refreshment.\nThere is a considerable amount of prep-time required for both drinks, but it is well worth it in the end.\nReady to go ? Alright !\nINGREDIENTS :\nWatermelon\nFresh Chervil\nMidori (or another melon liqueur)\n16 oz Light Cream\nAn Orange (or any citrus)\nGranulated Sugar\nTOOLS:\nBlender\nSpoons\nKnives\nCutting Boards\nBowls\nPitcher\nShot Glasses (for measuring)\n8oz Cocktail Glasses\nTumblers\n*In this Instructable, you will be mincing chervil.

I suggest the same thing to you.\n**This Instructable also contains an alcoholic liqueur (Midori) - If you do not drink, or if you are too young to drink, just use the parts of the Instructable relating to the Cooler.

Try to keep the pieces as large as will fit into your blender,because each cut on the cutting board results in lost juice. Once you get it into the blender, liquefy it. Pour most of the melon into a shallow tray that can be frozen, and put the remainder into the fridge.\nWe will be blending the watermelon again once frozen, and keeping the juice reserve will allow you to add some of that to the blender instead of diluting it with water.

In the case of the cream, you want it COLD, not FROZEN, so periodically check to make sure it isn't becoming Chervil ice cream. If it is, move it to the fridge.\n*The infusion process happens over the hours in the freezer and/or fridge. The oils from the Chervil - especially the stems - seep into the cream over time. Faster infusion can happen if the fruits/vegetables are steeped first, HOWEVER Chervil doesn't do well when cooked. - It loses what little flavor it has - So, we need to do this slowly and naturally.\n**Also note that I do not strain out any of the Chervil used.

First out of the gate is the Midori, which is powerfully sweet. As it moves into the infused cream, the sweetness mellows out, and the aftertaste of the chervil cuts it even further. Once one moves into mostly cream, the flavor becomes very mellow, and the Chervil leaves *almost* a bitter aftertaste -\nWhich works !\nOnce one moves into the fresh melon slush, the melon seems even 'fresher' - its hard to describe but I'd say the slight licorice flavor the Chervil provides cancels out the sweetness of the Midori as well as the alcohol 'bite' leaving one to enjoy the watermelon as it is. That makes this the kind of drink that can \"sneak up on you\" as the alcohol content is almost entirely disguised. Tread lightly !\nCOOLER :\nThe cooler is watermelon cream through and through. The Chervil leaves behind an interesting aftertaste that contrasts with the melon cream but not so much as to compete with it. I could easily drink a few of these on a hot summer day.\nFINAL THOUGHTS :\nI am pleasantly surprised by the result of this experiment, as it was entirely driven by The Ferrous Chef Challenge, and nothing I would have ever thought to make without being prompted.

Look west and you can see pods of dolphins, rafts of sea lions, whales breaching, birds diving-it\u2019s a silver scaled smorgasbord for sea creatures. A fishermen friend even reported seeing a Great White Shark jump from the water in all her toothy glory. She most likely wasn\u2019t snacking on anchovies, but those who ate them. Humans don\u2019t join in on this bounty as much as we should.\nLittle fish like smelt, herring, anchovies and sardines are delicious, super nutritious and very sustainable. Unfortunately, they\u2019ve gotten a bad rap as \u201cfishy-fish\u201d and so instead of eating down the food chain, Americans consume more shrimp, tuna, and farmed salmon than anything else. The cultivation or fishing of shrimp, tuna and farmed salmon is often devastating to the ocean. In fact farmed \u201cAtlantic\u201d salmon is full of antibiotics; it\u2019s mealy, soft flesh would be gray if not for the colorants added to their feed-which is made of ocean caught forage fish like the anchovy and wiping out whole eco-systems.\nA report by Tacon and Metian published in the 2008 projected that the current ratio is 2.5 to 3 pounds of forage fish to produce 1 pound of farmed salmon. This ratio is problematic as we are now seeing herring, mackerel, sardines and anchovies being overfished throughout the world to be made into feed for salmon, tuna, industrial meat farms, and fertilizer. These small forage fish are critical parts of the larger food web; fish, mammals, and birds rely on the silver shoals of omega-three and protein rich small fish. Instead of feeding 3 pounds of anchovies to the farmed salmon, we should avoid farmed salmon and instead just eat 1 pound of anchovies, and leave the other 2 in the sea. Along with being sustainable, these little fish are inexpensive, super nutritious, delicious and store really well. The only catch? Cleaning them.

When the nest is dried, it is valued for culinary use, said to possess medicinal, as well as aphrodisiac qualities. The nest has a gelatinous texture when cooked, and it is often used for soups, very expensive soups.\nBut we'll skip the Swiftlet spit, and make our own edible nest using your choice of white potatoes, sweet potatoes or even taro root, a bulbous root typically found in the produce section of an Asian supermarket. After frying the nest, referred to as a Phoenix Nest in the culinary world, it is filled with a delicious beef and pepper stir-fry.

While you could easily improvise, a second spider is best for making the nest that will contain the beef and peppers. Look for the gadget under key words such as spider, strainer, Asian strainer and such. They are available in different sizes such as 6\u201d, 8\u201d and even larger, depending on what size nest you would like to make.They usually run about $7.00 - $8.00, so if you are expressing concern that the tools are too expensive, ask yourself how much you paid for the last Asian dinner at a restaurant. If you buy the tools, you can make your own dinner, and keep the tools. Besides, you'll want to make this dish again, and the strainers can also be used for other things in the kitchen...you know, like straining!\nWOK: - A wok, or other frying pan which will enable heating of several inches of cooking oil. Be certain the pan is deep enough to cover the basket of the spider, but not so deep that the tool cannot be safely used at an angle.\nCHEESE GRATER or MANDOLINE: \u2013 You will need something to shred or slice potatoes in a very thin strip. A mandoline (not to be confused with the musical instrument 'mandolin') will produce thicker strands of fries that will form a heartier basket, while a cheese grater with large holes will make a more delicate bedding for the beef and peppers. Please note! Using a potato or yam on a mandoline can be a bit dangerous, as the vegetables are very firm, requiring quite a push on the blade to cut properly. Use extreme caution, and always use the protective vegetable holder that should have been included with your mandoline.\nDEEP FRY THERMOMETER: Oil temperature should be 325 degrees (for white potatoes) to 350 degrees (for sweet potatoes or Taro root), depending on which root used for the nest.\nOTHER: Paper towels, sharp knife, measuring cups and spoons, fork, scissors, etc.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSF/8WAR/HZXYLSCQ/FSF8WARHZXYLSCQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNV/8AAY/HZXYLRTT/FNV8AAYHZXYLRTT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAE/I715/I09LUNBX/FAEI715I09LUNBX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Equipment Needed (or Helpful)"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Recipe courtesy of Sunset Magazine / Lane Publishing.\nNote: some ingredients are called for more than once, and some are needed for a separate cooking sauce, shown below (*).

Once the pieces have been dried off, sprinkle 1 Tablespoon of corn starch onto them, and mix well. You may add a little more corn starch if needed.

Move to a paper towel. Use a fork to scrape any segments that may have locked the nest into the spiders. Usually, you can scrape the top spider, and it will release.

After a few months people began to get very hungry, particularly during the Spring when home grown vegetables were scarce, and resorted to some desperate measures to stay alive. Some people stole food from the Germans and when they were caught they were sent to concentration camps, others grew their own food and hid it from the Germans who, themselves, would also try and steal it. Strangely, if the Germans were caught stealing they were shot.\nMy Grandmother would make soup from nettles, which was surprisingly nutritious, stews from rats and, secretly, she would make chutney with earwigs and cockroaches. In the last case she was not worried about being caught by the Germans, but more so by the other members of the family who would no doubt be horrified to learn what they were eating!\nFor the next four years my Grandmother became an expert earwig hunter and devised all sorts traps and techniques for finding the elusive creatures. After the Germans were defeated her own family was surprisingly healthy whilst her neighbours looked in a terrible state. Later in her life, just before she died and obviously plagued by guilt, she confessed to me her terrible crime. I could barely understand her frail whispery voice as she told me, slipping me a crumbled piece of paper in her cold thin hand. She was very surprised when I replied that it was now fashionable in London to eat insects and, holding her hand, we smiled at each other and she shed a small tear in the corner of her bloodshot eyes.\nDifficulty: ..........\nCost: ..........\nSatisfaction: ..........\nHazards: ..........\nA recent UN report said that eating insects such as earwigs could help boost nutrition and reduce pollution. It notes than over 2 billion people worldwide already supplement their diet with insects each week. Additionally, insect farming, is \"one of the many ways to address food and feed security\".\"Insects are everywhere and they reproduce quickly, and they have high growth and feed conversion rates and a low environmental footprint.\". However \"consumer disgust\" remains a large barrier in many Western countries. Insects are nutritious, and have a high protein, fat and mineral content. They are \"particularly important as a food supplement for undernourished children\". Insects are also \"extremely efficient\" in converting feed into edible meat. Crickets, for example, need 12 times less feed than cattle to produce the same amount of protein, according to the report. Also, most insects are are likely to produce fewer environmentally harmful greenhouse gases than other livestock. The report suggests that the people could help in \"raising the status of insects\" by including them in new recipes and adding them to restaurant menus. It goes on to note that in some places, certain insects are considered delicacies. For example some caterpillars in southern Africa are seen as luxuries and command high prices. Insects could be the super food of the future.", "title": "Earwig Chutney - a Grandmother's Confession", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Earwig-Chutney-A-Grandmothers-Confession/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "My Grandmother's hunting techniques were composed of three main strategies:\nRandomly finding the insects in boxes, under stones etc.\nBuilding earwig traps.\nTraining the dog to find food.\nObviously, plans one and two were quite logical, but plan three depended very much on the efficiency of the dog in hunting both insects and rats. At one point, in a particularly desperate moment, the dog itself almost found itself in the cooking pot. I decided to have a go at all three strategies and give each one a rating. I found that strategy one was very time consuming and would only work if you were really starving. Strategy three was OK, but the dog kept on getting distracted by mice, which she just ate herself and would not share with me. So, in the end, the trap building became the main way to catch the earwigs.\nThere are many ways that my Grandmother used to trap earwigs, although cockroaches were bigger, more common and easier to catch by method one. A favourite would be to put out a bowl of bait liquid such as tomato soup with a lid on it with small holes allowing the insects to enter within. Another trap consisted of hollow stems of plants such as nettles and hogweed cut and tied together as in the photo. The stem trap would be laid in a dark, damp place outside for the insects to make their Autumn/fall homes in. During the four years of the German occupation, she became increasingly adept at catching insects until she could catch thousands of earwigs in a single day. All without the family noticing!\nHogweed sap will cause burns to your skin so only cut dry stems.\nThe common Earwig, Forficula auricularia, is nocturnal and feeds on a large variety of plants and other insects. It used to be believed that earwigs would crawl inside the human ear, lay eggs, which would hatch out to go on and eat your brains. Earwigs like to live in warm, damp and dark places like under pieces of cardboard and in old wooden boxes in the garden.\n\nhttp://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TjDM3xWK5Lk Earwig trap that has results", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F55/EEZJ/HZWJ58VT/F55EEZJHZWJ58VT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUP/PG2E/HZWJ5DJC/FUPPG2EHZWJ5DJC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3K/IJJU/I05EZ62U/F3KIJJUI05EZ62U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1M/PZ53/I05EZ64O/F1MPZ53I05EZ64O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F64/Q50K/I05EZ670/F64Q50KI05EZ670.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNR/UZ9B/I05EZ6RM/FNRUZ9BI05EZ6RM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Hunting for Earwigs"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "In my grandmother's time it was important to disguise the fact that there were wonderfully nutritious insects in her chutney so it is our own choice as to how to incorporate them in a modern day food.

The most radical approach would be to use the earwigs whole, maybe giving them a quick toasting in a frying pan before adding them to the main pan just before bottling - this way they would be big and crunchy and really obvious. Alternatively, they could be finely chopped and added directly to the pan earlier in the cooking stage.

People are starting to embrace fattier cuts, and cooking with pork lard is making a comeback. With the welcome of full flavored, lard-laden pork, the fat, furry Mangalitsa heritage breed of pig, native to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, is gaining in popularity. Known as the \u201ckobe beef\u201d of the pork world, their meat is marbled and fat stores plentiful. It\u2019s said that their fat is less saturated that normal pig fat, and so tastes lighter and cleaner. Farmers are cross breeding them with other breeds to get a pig that grows fast and has lots of fat. This one that we broke down was cross bred with a Red Waddle, also a chubby breed and a fast grower.\nJointing a pig is different from traditional butchering. If you separate at the joints, you don\u2019t need big knives or saws. Notice, we were able to do most of this pig with small paring knives, though doing it with this method, some of the cuts are less traditional. Every part of this pig has been used, except about 2 cups of glands that were thrown out. The liver and pancreas were saved for pate, the hooves made into \u201cSPAM\u201d, meat scraps into sausage, bones cooked into stock, skin into chicharrones, the ears cooked and sliced, fat rendered down into lard and the head will become pozole. Keep in mind, there are only two tenderloins on a pig, and not that many pork chops-often, so in our traditional food chains, many lesser-valued parts of the pig get thrown out. So eating the whole pig will require more creativity and an adventurous spirit.

For items like the pink curing salt (aka cure #1, or prague powder #1) get a really accurate postage scale or jewelry scale. Most scales for your kitchen will not measure low gram weights accurately, and getting the quantities correct for curing salt is pretty essential for good quality bacon.\n\nIngredients:\n\n4.5lbs of Pork Belly with Skin On\nKosher Salt - 1/4 cup\nMaple syrup - 4 ounces\nbrown sugar - 1/4 cup\nspiced rum (or bourbon) - 2 ounces\npink salt (cure #1, prague powder #1) - 1/2 tsp per pound of belly (2.25 tsp.)\nblack pepper - 2 Tbsp\ngarlic powder - 1 Tbsp\ncrushed bay leaves - 2 crushed\ngarlic cloves - 7 to 8 fresh cloves, crushed\n\nPink salt or Cure is something to be careful with when using. If you are unsure how much to add to your recipe, there is a great curing calculator here where you enter your meat weight and what you want the final product (salt/sweet) to be. It's a good estimator for curing salt.\n\nAlso on the Spiced Rum, you can use any 80 proof and up liquor you like (within reason), just try to pick a liquor that compliments the flavors of pork, fat, smoke and salt. Bacon marries well to the molasses in the spiced/dark rums, but also cozies up very comfortably with the wood tannins and vanilla in a good American Bourbon. Pick something that tastes good to you, and just remember if you use something strongly flavored like a schnapps or a Cordial, your bacon might wind up looking unappealing and taste like crap. I would state any whiskey and most rums would work well in this recipe and some of the higher proof nut, honey and flower flavored cordials would also work well in this bacon if carefully chosen.

A shaded table under a patio umbrella is a perfect location.\n\nYou can dry your peppers whole but it takes much longer.

The enzyme is denatured by any temperature high enough to cook meat, so becomes completely safe to eat after cooking.\nAs well as being able to bind or thicken animal ingredients, meat glue is often used industrially to combine smaller scraps of meat into larger, more appealing pieces which can be sold as single cuts to the consumer. Ethical and safety issues aside, this is a very clever trick which opens doors to some intriguing cookery possibilities.\nWith the rise in popularity of molecular gastronomy, meat glue has recently made its way into the home kitchen and can now be bought online very cheaply.

This recipe is really worth trying... no mixer, no bread machine, no kneading, no floured counter top to clean, and not even a mixing bowl to wash! :)\nThis recipe is based on a popular no-knead breadmaking method that uses very little yeast, high amount of liquid, and a loooong proofing time. Yes, 8-12 hours of proofing sounds like a long time, but the dough just sits there, while you get on with your TV watching, or internet surfing, or sleeping, or school, or work.\nI \"lazified\" the original recipe even more by making the dough in a plastic bag. This eliminates the annoying task of washing a doughy bowl. I have also chosen a more affordable baking vessel. Instead of the cast-iron casserole or dutch oven specified by most recipes (those things are like \u00a350/$80 upwards!), I use a cheap loaf pan lined with non-stick parchment paper. Of course, if you prefer, you can follow the conventional way and use a bowl and/or bake in a pricey container (different baking directions required if using a cast-iron pot / dutch oven).\nThe resulting bread is of course very delicious. How can homemade bread not be? It's crusty on the outside (while fresh out of the oven), soft and moist inside.\nAnyway, here are the ingredients:\n420 gram (3 & 1/4 cup) strong white flour (bread flour)\n1/4 teaspoon instant yeast (aka 'easy bake', 'yeast for bread machines')\n3/4 teaspoon salt (or a little more if you prefer saltier bread)\n3 teaspoon sugar (optional)\n300 ml / gram (1 & 1/4 cup) cool room temperature water\nDirections:\nPlease take a look at the video above. It explains the steps more clearly than the written instructions below.\nStep 1: Mix all dry ingredients in a large food bag.\nStep 2: Add the water. Massage for a minute or two to form a dough. It's a very sticky and ugly dough.\nStep 3: Let the dough proof in room temperature for 8 to 12 hours.\nStep 4: When the dough has proofed, dump it out into a loaf pan or baking tray that has been lined with non-stick parchment paper (and lightly oiled).\nStep 5: Cover with a piece of oiled plastic wrap and let it proof again for 1.5 to 2 hours.\nStep 6: The dough should have almost doubled in size. Bake in a pre-heated oven (220C/430F or 200C/400F fan oven) for 20 minutes, then reduce the temperature (to 195C/380F or 175C/350F) and bake for 10 more minutes. Ovens vary, you may need to adjust accordingly. The bread is done when browned on all sides and sounds echoy when you tap the bottom.\nStep 7: Transfer onto a wire rack ASAP. Wait at least 10 minutes before cutting into it. Best eaten on the day. Okay the next day. Quite dry by day three (time for the toaster).\nPlease feel free to leave any comments or questions below.

The sandwich consists of a single warmed, hollowed-out loaf of bread filled with the contents of one jar of creamy peanut butter, one jar of grape jelly, and a pound of bacon. The sandwich's connection to Elvis Presley is the source of its legend and prolonged interest. According to The Life and Cuisine of Elvis Presley, it was the focus of a midnight sandwich run by Elvis Presley and his friends. Taking his private jet from Graceland, Presley and his friends purchased 22 of the sandwiches and spent three hours eating the sandwiches and drinking Perrier and champagne before flying home. The story became legend and the sandwich became the subject of continued media interest and part of numerous cookbooks, typically focused around Presley's love of food.\nIf you wish to try the original version, I've included it at the end of the instructable.", "title": "Fool's Gold Sandwich", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Fools-Gold-Sandwich/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Peanut Butter, smooth or chunky (I used smooth)\nGrape Jelly\nSliced Bread (white or wheat)\nBacon", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FH4/ESWS/HZGT9J9A/FH4ESWSHZGT9J9A.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Ingredients"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Cook 4 slices of bacon.

The meatball part of this recipe I picked up during my time as a student, which can be the reason for the beer. I won't talk much about meatballs, use your own basic recipe, but I will give you an explanation on how to prepare them together with the sauce. In this part I will also give a brief explanation of its history and traditions.\nThis recipe is especially made as an inspiration starter. Many variations can be made with this. You can change (not improve) your hutspot by adding ingredients you think match the taste.

This night the siege of Leiden was ended. The legend speaks of a small orphan boy who found a pot with cooked food the Spaniards left behind when leaving their camp in a hurry. The pot contained mashed carrots with unions and parsnip which they named 'Hutspot'. In the centuries which followed the parsnip was replaced by potatoes. Many people living in Leiden, and many other Dutch, including me from now on, still eat Hutspot on october 3th as a remembrance to the relief of Leiden.\nHow to:\nPeel and cut the potatoes into small parts\nCut the unions into halve rings\nPeel and cut the carrots into small blocks\nPut all ingredients in one cooking pot and cook it untill it is soft\nDrain the water and mash everything\nAdd a little bit of milk if the mash is to dry.\nAdd a little grounded nutmeg and salt.\nSome variations:\nAdd small blocks of baked bacon at the end.\nRemove carrot before mashing and add them again after mashing for a little more bite.\nOnly cook halve of the unions and bake the other halve.

Luckely it's not hundreds of years old, but only tens of years. Traditionally this dish included only hutspot. It was introduced somewhere before the 45th year (2001-2002) of my study association Simon Stevin. (I'm still researching the exact year.) It was eaten by the land-yachting committee during the first BEESD of the new committee supervisor. (BEESD: A day filled with maintenance of the land yachts, drinking beers and partying.) A couple of years later, probably during the 47th year (2003-2004), meatballs were added. The beer-curryketchup sauce was added even later, probably between the 48th (2004-2005) and the 50th year (2006-2007). We think someone just added the beer and curryketchup which turned out nice and therefore is made ever since. The new committee members do the dishes afterwards, the second years members do the cooking. The older members make a mess of the kitchen (and rest of the house) of the supervisor, using potato, union and carrot waste.\nHow to:\nMake the meatballs using your basic recipe.\nSear the meatballs.\nContinue with low too medium heat untill they are still a little red on the inside, turn regularly to prevent them from sticking to the pan.\nAdd the beer and continue with adding the curryketchup untill the sauce is only a little 'wet'. The sauce will thicken due to the heat and the evaporation of the water.\nContinue with low to medium heat until the meatballs are ready. Again, turn regularly, this time not only to prevent sticking, but also so the sauce can touch and 'infuse' the entire meatball.\nWhen the meatballs are finished, check whether the sauce is thick enough. When it's still to 'wet', just add curryketchup untill the sauce looks good.\nSome variations:\nUse other meat than meatballs\nPrepare with much more beer like these beer brats. Add the curry when only a small amount of beer is left to intensify the beer taste.\nExperiment with beers other than lager.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1L/GIKH/HZCIXRB9/F1LGIKHHZCIXRB9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F33/O3LZ/HZCIXRBH/F33O3LZHZCIXRBH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQL/F827/HZCIXRCB/FQLF827HZCIXRCB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBJ/A7VM/HZCIXRD4/FBJA7VMHZCIXRD4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD3/GT3Q/HZCIXRDC/FD3GT3QHZCIXRDC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPE/PJ2G/HZCIXRH9/FPEPJ2GHZCIXRH9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM8/UGCO/HZCIXRKH/FM8UGCOHZCIXRKH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F11/1X32/HZCIXRMA/F111X32HZCIXRMA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9R/SO1O/HZCIXRMP/F9RSO1OHZCIXRMP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Meatballs in Beer-curryketchup Sauce"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "When you're finished with cooking, it's time to serve.

I have not used the noodle seasoning since we get bored of it after sometime when you are in a dorm.\nSo come along to see how to make delicious and inexpensive Pizza in your dorm with just an Iron Box and kettle. This is real fun and crazy way to have a Pizza and stun your room mates.\nIf you like it, please do vote for me in the contests.

I asked Bricobart himself and he suggests using a dark beer because the end result will be sweeter. You should use a malty beer versus a hoppy beer because the hops in the beer will turn bitter when cooked whereas malty beers become sweet. Think of a malt shake or Whopper malt candies, they're all very saccharine. I highly recommend asking an employee what beers that they recommend when shopping. I went to my local Whole Foods and picked up this Vanilla Porter that the employee recommended to me because he said it was very sweet and is great for desserts.\nSince all beers are different, you might need more than 1/4 cup of sugar. I would start off with 1/4 cup and then add more as needed. Same is for vanilla and salt. Vanilla and salt can definitely enhance the flavors of the ice cream but sometimes they aren't necessary. I didn't need any vanilla extract when making ice cream with Vanilla Porter because it already contains some vanilla flavor.

This process thickens the custard and will make the ice cream more creamy, however you don't want the temperature to go above 185 degrees Fahrenheit or else you risk the egg in the mixture turning into small chunks. I recommend using a cooking thermometer and taking the mixture off of the heat when it reaches 180 degrees Fahrenheit.

Totally hits the spot when I get that savory munchies craving. They're also great for dips and salsas.\nAdmittedly they do take some time to make, but all the steps are simple and require little skills and no special tools. In fact, I don't even use a mixing bowl or rolling pin (you could if you like). Like with all my other recipes, the amount of washing & cleaning is minimal.\nAll details are in the recipe video above. Please check it out! Or follow the written instructions below.\nINGREDIENTS:\n130 g (1 cup) All-purpose (aka Plain) Flour\n130 g (3/4 cup) Cornmeal (aka Polenta) - I use fine cornmeal. I think coarse would also work.\n1/4 teaspoon Baking Powder\nheaped 1/2 teaspoon Salt (adjust to personal liking)\ngenerous dash cayenne pepper (or paprika or black pepper, if you can't handle a little heat)\n120 ml (4 fl oz) Hot Water (not boiling)\n10 g (2-3 teaspoon) Vegetable Oil\nSTEP 1 - MAKE THE DOUGH\nMix together the dry ingredients (flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, cayenne) in a frying pan or mixing bowl. I use a frying pan because it will be used to cook the tortillas later, so I thought might as well mix & knead the dough in it. Add the hot water and oil. Mix into a dough, first I use a spatula then switch to hands. This is a very easy dough to handle. It's not too sticky and not too crumbly. Knead for just one minute. Form a dough ball, coat with a little oil, cover with plastic wrap. Let it rest for 10-15 minutes.\nSTEP 2 - MAKE & COOK THE TORTILLAS\nTo keep my counter top easy to clean, I wet it slightly then lay down a piece of plastic wrap. The plastic clings onto the damp surface and stays in place.\nDivide into six dough balls. Coat them with a little oil (residual oil from the pan). Give the pan a quick wipe and heat on the stove top over medium heat. Press out the first dough ball. I use my palms and fingers. You can use a rolling pin if you prefer. Press it out to about 18-20cm diameter and 1-1.5mm thick. Place in the heated pan and cook for about 2 minutes per side, until you get brown edges and spots. Place on a foil-lined baking tray. While one is cooking, I press out the next one.\nSTEP 3 - CRISPEN UP THE CHIPS\nWhen I have finished cooking six tortillas, I break each up into 8 to 10 rustic-looking chips. If you want them neat, cut with kitchen scissors while warm.\nPreheat the oven to 170C (330F) or fan 150C (300F). Bake the tray of chips for 10-12 minutes.\nThey don't brown much more in the oven. To check that they're ready, find a thicker piece and eat it to find out! It should be crunchy and snappy and totally delicious. When they are completely cooled, store in a seal-able bag. They keep well for several days.\nIf you like this recipe, please check out my other Instructables. And 'follow' me for more easy baking recipes to come.

As a cook and baker I had to do something for the contest, but what can I do with watermelon that hasn't been done before? Also how in the heck do I use chervil with watermelon?\nSince I had no idea what to do, I did what I usually do in this situation- I started playing with my food. My wife loves watermelon so there happened to be some cut up in the fridge. So what can I do with watermelon? I've heard that it gets really firm and takes on a meat-like appearance when put under vacuum. I thought about a sweet rice and vacuum-firmed watermelon dessert sushi with a dab of chervil infused cream cheese 'wasabi', but I don't have a vacuum pump anymore and I didn't want to buy one (If someone else wanted to make that for this contest I'd be totally cool with it- do it!). That got me thinking about other ways of changing the watermelon's texture. I've done my share of jerky making and veggie drying but I never tried watermelon. I sliced some thin and laid it on a foil lined baking sheet. I placed the baking sheet in the oven on warm, left the door cracked so the vapor could escape and left it alone. I use a terra cotta sheet in my oven to distribute the heat more evenly. After a few hours I had sweet watermelon 'leather'. It stuck to the foil a bit but I knew I was on the right track\nOne of my favorite uses for dried fruit is making chutney. Chutney is a culinary catch-all condiment with countless adaptations and local variations. In it's most basic form chutney is a condiment made from fruits, spices, vinegar and sugar. It can be chunky like a salsa or relish or a smooth and homogenous as ketchup. Originally, chutney came from India. It was adopted by the British colonial occupiers and passed on to the mariners of the British sea trade. These sailors took chutney to every corner of the British empire, where it mutated and adapted to the local diet and produce. The sun never sets on the chutney empire!\nChutney is the perfect geek food- it's open source, it spread virally, it can be hacked and adapted endlessly and there's lot's of fun tools and techniques. Chutney with dried watermelon sounded intriguing, but what about the chervil?\nI decided to try making chervil infused rum to reconstitute the dried fruit. When infusing herbs directly into alcohol the herbs need to be dried well and the alcohol needs to be strong. When the alcohol has dissolved the aromatic oils from the herbs it is then poured over dried fruit. The fruit absorbs the alcohol and the flavorful oils. When the fruit is cooked in the final sauce the alcohol evaporates away leaving the herbal flavor as well as the rum flavor distributed throughout the fruit.\nBy combining the watermelon and chervil infused rum with some other ingredients I'll make a chutney. This requires several steps over three days, including preparing the herb infused rum, dehydrating the watermelon, preparing the other fruits and cooking the sauce. Although I can't actually share the final product with you, I will incorporate it into a meal and conduct a taste test with some of my friends and report the results here.", "title": "Let's Make Chutney With Dried Watermelon and Chervil Infused Rum", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Lets-make-Watermelon-Chervil-Chutney/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I never plan chutney. It's always a matter of seeing some random ingredients in the fridge and deciding to make a batch. Watermelon is easy in the South this time of year. Chervil proved to be another story. My wife checked the local Publix where she got the melon but they had none. We checked a few other local markets with no luck. I decided to check Whole Foods, where after practically begging for service I was told that they were out and had no idea when they would have some. I was running out of options.\nThey recently opened a Trader Joe's in my town. While I've heard good things about them, they opened a store with very little parking and have been the cause of nasty traffic snarls ever since they opened, so I have not gone there yet. I decided to see if they had chervil. After waiting for 20 minutes just to get in the parking lot I finally found a space and went inside. While their staff was very helpful, they had no chervil. After fighting to get back out of the parking nightmare that was the Trader Joe's lot and vowing not to return until the parking situation improved, I decided to try one more place. I drove to the fancy Publix Greenwise Market and, lo and behold, I found chervil! It was a bit yellow and it had more packaging than I usually tolerate in a product, but it was the only game in town and I was determined to see this quest through. I bought the chervil, hit the liquor store for the rum and went home to start prepping my sauce.\nThe rest of the ingredients were things I had on hand- a mango, onion, dried cranberries, vinegars, honey and spices.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F93/5OXW/HZ3GBRX1/F935OXWHZ3GBRX1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYY/GFP6/HZ2IYT52/FYYGFP6HZ2IYT52.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWU/E0K5/HZ3GD4VI/FWUE0K5HZ3GD4VI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3Q/RTWQ/HZ3GBJS9/F3QRTWQHZ3GBJS9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Gathering the Ingredients"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The first step in making herb infused rum is drying the herb. If you have plenty of time, simply hang loose bunches of chervil up in a dry place and wait until they are properly dry. If you're in a hurry, remove the stems from the fresh chervil and dehydrate it. If you have a dehydrator use it, otherwise spread your herb on foil and place it in the oven on 'warm' (around 150 degrees f) until it is dry- about 30. The main difference is that the fast drying method has more chlorophyll in the final product than the slow dried herb. The chlorophyll adds a slightly bitter taste, but for chutney it's not too important as the orgy of flavors will make it right at home.\nPlace the dried and de-stemmed herb in a glass container and cover with over-proof rum. I used about 150 ml of Bacardi 151, which is 151 proof or 75% alcohol (most rum is 80 proof or 40% alcohol). The higher the alcohol content, the more efficiently the herb's flavors will be extracted. I'm using rum in this recipe because it adds a flavor profile of its own, but you could easily use high proof vodka or grain alcohol. Everclear comes in 175 proof and leaves very little flavor of its own behind when it evaporates. Be careful if you drink this stuff- it's almost twice as strong as 'normal' rum. I rarely drink and don't advocate the regular consumption of alcohol. Please drink responsibly.\nCover your container and put it somewhere it won't be disturbed for at least 24-48 hours. Be aware that over-proof rum is highly flammable.

I cut it into 1\" cubes, sprinkled them lightly with salt and placed them in a large Tupperware container.\nGather a package of bamboo skewers, some olive oil and a rectangular baking dish narrower than the length of your skewers. Give your skewers a good coat of olive oil and let them sit for a few minutes before tapping the excess oil off. This will make the dried watermelon stick less. Get your melon cubes and make melon kabobs on the oiled skewers. Place your skewers full of melon cubes across the baking dish placed close but not touching so the cubes can dry evenly. If you don't have enough room for them all you can add more skewers later as the melon shrinks. You should have some melon juice left over in the bottom of the container. Put this in an air tight container and put it in the fridge for later. Place the pan in the oven on warm- the target temperature is around 150 degrees. Check the melon every hour or so and rotate the pan and the skewers to insure even drying. You want firm, dry pieces of dry red watermelon with a similar texture to sun dried tomatoes. My 1\" cubes took about 12 hours to dry. Smaller pieces would dry quicker, but they'd take more oven space and require two batches. When the melon is dried, let it cool and set it aside in an air tight container.\nYou may be wondering what the point of all this drying is. Well, dry fruit absorbs moisture. If that moisture has flavor, it will infuse the fruit with that flavor. Chutney is like culinary jazz. It is to condiments what curry is to spice- a complex mixture of flavors that creates something unique and greater than the sum of its parts. With a chutney sauce you want a blended, homogenous product.

I added a dash of rice vinegar. I brought the mixture to a gentle boil, stirring constantly. I let it boil gently uncovered for about 10 minutes, stirring regularly to prevent sticking. Keep in mind that in the early stages of the boiling it will be giving off a high percentage of alcohol in the steam. While it won't be a high enough concentration to burn, it may be a respiratory irritant. Use proper ventilation.\nI reduced the heat to a very light simmer and covered the pot. I checked it every 15 minutes or so to stir it. If it begins to stick turn down the heat. As the fruit absorbs more liquid and the alcohol evaporates you may have to add more liquid. Use the leftover melon juice from earlier to replace the moisture as this adds a little more sweetness to the sauce. I continued to simmer the sauce until all the fruit was soft and mushy, at least 30 minutes. When the mixture was nice and soft I started mashing it with a fork. The goal now is to create a semi smooth mixture with the consistency of thin oatmeal. If it's too thick add some more liquid; if it's too thin let it simmer uncovered a little longer until it's thicker. Making sauces requires patience- overheating will ruin everything. Make small adjustments until it's just right.\nNow I set the sauce aside to cool and then pureed it in a blender. Once it's well blended it should be a bit thinner- closer to the consistency of Sriracha sauce. add a little more juice or water if necessary. I put it back in the saucepan and slowly heated it to a gentle simmer. I stirred it until it reached the desired thickness of thick ketchup and then removed it from the heat. Ta Da- watermelon-chervil chutney!\nThis recipe is a good candidate for traditional canning as it's high in sugar and vinegar. It could be scaled up to make a larger batch. If you're not into canning it can also be stored in the fridge for quite a long time. The vinegar and sugar preserves the chutney by preventing the growth of harmful microbes.Honey is one of the best natural preservatives there is- honey never goes bad.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQA/AJ4N/HZ3YD3XJ/FQAAJ4NHZ3YD3XJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Q/VTN1/HZ3YDE57/F1QVTN1HZ3YDE57.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F98/AKM3/HZ3YDE5W/F98AKM3HZ3YDE5W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F26/YGH1/HZ3YDIQA/F26YGH1HZ3YDIQA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Day 3 Afternoon- Cooking the Sauce"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "So that was some fancy process but how does it taste? It has a clear sweetness from the melon and other fruit as well as a tang from the vinegars. The spices blend well for a savory note and the red pepper gives a nice, subtle bite. Although the alcohol almost entirely evaporates it leaves a spicy rum flavor and the chervil adds a nice herbal crispness. This is just my first impression fresh from the stove. Now I'll pack it in an airtight container and store it in the fridge for a few days before serving it. Whether it's spaghetti sauce, stew or chutney sauces always taste better after a day or two of rest in the fridge.\nI'm planning a simple dinner with a few friends on Sunday night where I'll serve the chutney and get my guest's impressions of the watermelon chervil chutney. Check back next week for an update!\nThe Taste Test\nSo I wanted to taste test the chutney with a few friends, but you can't just hand out spoons and pass the jar around. I needed to come up with a meal that would showcase the chutney without overpowering it. A quick pantry raid yielded lentils, elephant garlic, green curry, Greek yoghurt, broccoli, cauliflower, a red onion, cashews, a can of coconut milk, some sweet Thai rice and some chicken breasts. I can work with that.\nI roasted the garlic until it was as soft as butter. I added the roasted garlic and some spices to the lentils and cooked them. I used the yoghurt to make a spicy green curry sauce. I sauteed the red onion, broccoli and cauliflower in sesame oil and finished it with honey and a handful of cashews. I cooked the sweet rice with coconut milk and a few cardamom seeds. I cubed the chicken breasts and rubbed them with the chutney and let it marinade in the fridge for a few hours and then stir fried it in sesame and olive oil.\nThe wife and I invited two other couples over for dinner. Sam and Kimmy are vegetarians so I plated them up everything but the chicken. I put the curry sauce and chutney out and let them take what they wanted. Opinions were generally good about the meal. One guest remarked that the chutney's flavor was sweet first with an herby aftertaste with subtle notes of licorice. Another said that it had a concentrated flavor and a little went a long way. Everyone agreed that the sweetness was a good complement to the earthiness of the lentils and the spice of the curry.\nThe chicken was awesome. The sugars caramelized nicely in the skillet and made a savory glaze. While it was a decent chutney, and with a few changes it could be a great chutney, I think it was even better as a marinade/rub. I'm saving the last bit of it to try with salmon this weekend. I may have to add a follow-up to this follow-up.\nWhile it worked good in combination with other bold flavors, I think the chutney was a little too sweet. It almost seems like it got sweeter after a few days in the fridge. If I made this again I would drain the watermelon better and not use the juice to reduce the sugar level a little. This would also make it dehydrate quicker, saving time. I'd also probably add a savory element and more pepper to balance it out a bit. It was interesting that the watermelon's seemingly delicate flavor was still familiar through the dehydrating, macerating and cooking. I want to try a batch with watermelon, apples and pears.

a great probiotic food and for being one of the cornerstones of Korean cuisine. There are other Kimchee instructables out there, but several things set this particular one apart:\nI've incorporated an optimization from the European sauerkraut making traditions into my method.\nI incorporated the Bay Area's favorite leafy green superfood, Lacinato kale (a.k.a. Tuscan kale or dinosaur kale), into my recipe.\nI include a primer on fermentation that gives you a nerd's-eye view of fermentation that will give you an understanding of what it is all about.\nI show you details about inexpensive but perfectly functional fermentation vessels that cost less than a tenth of what European style stoneware fermentation crocks cost.\nThis recipe doesn't leave out the ingredients westerners might be squeamish about\u2014 fish sauce and tiny salted shrimp or krill. Although these ingredients are overwhelming when tasted by themselves, they are the secret to a great tasting savory kimchee. I'll explain why in the corresponding step.\nMany of the steps are taken in the first-person-shooter perspective, so you know what you'll be looking at when you actually put your hand to the task.\nThe secret to food preservation:\nMake food inhospitable to microbial decomposers\nDid you know that foods do not decompose without biological intervention? The food may oxidize or dry out or go stale (starch retrogradation), and some substances may be unstable and break down into a more stable form, but if you took food, sealed it in a totally sterile bell jar filled with an inert gas, and irradiated all the microbes to death, it would never rot. It would sit there like the 14 year old McDonald's burger, forever untouched by decomposition as we know it. This is because decomposition is not merely oxidation and dehydration; decomposition is carried out by decomposers\u2014yeasts, bacteria, molds, worms, insects, or the digestion of some creature. The microbes that would gladly eat your food for you are everywhere; their spores are in the air, and they are often symbiotic with the produce that we buy, naturally occurring on the surfaces of the leaves and fruit. In the days before refrigeration, the options that we had for preserving food were fairly limited, and broadly speaking, they fall into several categories:\nChilling: store the food where it is cool, such as a cellar or a zeer pot (non-electrical refrigerator). The cooler temperatures hinder the onset of decomposition long enough for you to eat your food first. (This is generally not very long without freezing cold temperatures.)\nKillingthe microbes:\nSalting / curing: with enough salt, the food becomes osmotically hostile to any microbe. Salted fish, fruits, meats, and vegetables essentially resist microbial decomposition by dehydrating all the resident microbes to death.\nDrying: drying out a food can also be done simply by exposure to sun and dry air. This achieves the same outcome: the microbes present on the food and in the air find the dry food inhospitable, and either become dormant or die of dehydration.\nSmoking: smoking foods will impart chemicals from smoke that are naturally anti-microbial; this hinders any microbes from attacking the food from its surface.\nCandying: sugar, when used in sufficient concentration, will also make a food osmotically inhospitable to microbes. Jams, jellies, and preserves fall under this category.\nAcidifying or alkalizing: Vinegar can make a food too acidic for most microbial decomposers to survive, and is commonly used to pickle foods without direct fermentation, though most historic pickling methods produce the acid by bacterial fermentation. (Vinegar itself is a secondary fermentation product of wine or other alcoholic liquids.) Alternatively, some forms of this method of preservation use lye to make the food too alkaline for decomposers, such as the legendary Scandinavian lutefisk.\nCanning: Although canning as we know it is really pasteurization, and was not practiced in ancient times due to the inability to reliably seal a vessel against infiltration by microbes, canning is another low-tech way of preserving food that relies on killing all the resident microbes in a food by exposure to heat. Sealing the canning vessel prevents the infiltration of other microbes, thus preserving the food.\nFermenting: fermentation is essentially selecting what microbe (or microbes) you want to take over your food, and using the preferred microbes' natural defenses to fend off unwanted microbes.\nHow fermentation preserves food:\nOne form of filth kills another form of filth\nFermentation is best described as human intervention into a three way microbial war for the purpose of preserving food and enhancing its flavor. These are the three major combatants in this microbial war:\nYeast, which produce alcohol that kills bacteria and molds\nBacteria, whichproduce acids that kill molds and yeast\nMolds, which produce digestive enzymes and antibiotics that kill yeast and bacteria\nThese three battle for supremacy over who gets to take over our food, and in the course of doing so, produce substances which fend off the colonization and growth of the others, particularly the decomposers. This microbial chemical warfare is memorably summarized by the observation that one form of filth kills another form of filth. [1] What we do when we ferment is to make alliances with the microbe of our choice by creating conditions favorable to that particular kind of microbe so that they can take over our food; in exchange for letting them utilize some of the calories in the food, we utilize their natural defenses to ward off unwanted microbes that would decompose the food or cause food poisoning.\nIn some forms of fermentation, such as Kombucha (fermented tea), we ally ourselves with two classes of microbes at the same time\u2014bacteria and yeast. In others, such as Sake (Japanese rice wine), we switch sides midway through; in sake, mold is used to break down rice starch into fermentable sugars; then, the alliance with mold is broken as the moldy rice is mashed up to break up the mold structures; the mash subsequently liquefied and fermented with yeast, which convert the sugars into alcohol. For vinegar, yet another stage of fermentation is carried out where acetobacter bacteria are employed to convert alcohol (in low enough concentration that it won't kill bacteria) into acetic acid. In the case of rice wine vinegar, all three of the microbes are employed one after another. Many cured meats such as salami and cheeses such as brie are cured with penicillium mold, which colonize their outer surfaces and prevent the infiltration of harmful bacteria. Miso (fermented soy bean paste) is fermented with koji mold and preserved with salt. Sour cream and yogurt are fermented with various kinds of lactic acid bacteria and get their characteristic sourness from lactic acid and other flavorful acids.\nIn the case of kimchee, the fermentation is carried out by yeast and bacteria, with bacteria being the dominant player.\nFermentation for flavor and nutritional enhancement\nIn addition to fending off unwanted decomposers, fermentation has several great side effects, one of which is the enhancement of flavor. Consider what fermentation does to soy beans: soybeans and tofu are pretty bland, and are commonly used only as a substrate for sauces and other flavors, but once fermented, they become the basis of some of the most savory ingredients ever\u2014miso, doenjang (Korean style fermented bean paste), and soy-sauce. Fermentation is also what gives bread and wine and beer their depth of flavor compared to their unfermented ingredients.\nFermentation also has the added benefit of up-converting carbohydrates into vitamins and increasing the nutritional density of many foods. Consider kombucha; the tea and the sugar used to brew kombucha have no nutritional value besides empty calories, but after fermentation, kombucha is a rich source of B vitamins. Cabbage becomes more digestible and also sees its vitamin content increased by the process of being fermented into sauerkraut and kimchee. The microbes that carry out fermentation need these vitamins, but also have the metabolic pathways to make their own from the starches and sugars present in the food, whereas we do not. We merely benefit from them pre-processing the food.\nNow that we understand what's going on when we ferment, let's see this optimized method for making kimchee. Get some friends together and have a kimchee making party, and perhaps get some Korean food and a bottle of soju afterwards.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n[1] This is a paraphrase of an observation on the discovery of penicillin from Cracked.com.", "title": "Kimchee Party! a Recipe and a Primer on Fermentation", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Kimchee-Party-A-recipe-and-a-primer-on-fermentatio/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "(Note: Please see the photos in every step; a lot of them have attached notes.)\nPlease obtain the following equipment.

Make sure you get the one which has a lid with a moat, which serves as the air lock when water is added. The air lock lets carbon dioxide burp out of the jar as the kimchee ferments, but prevents mold spores and airborne bacteria from infiltrating the fermentation vessel. The method used since ancient times has been the moat filled with water, which is simple and effective.\nThese fermentation jars cost about $10 at the Korean markets in the San Francisco Bay Area, and come in sizes as small as a pint to as large as 20L for about $24. Do you realize how affordable this is? Even the Perfect Pickler\u2122 mason jar fermentation kits (for 1-2 quart jars) costs twice as much. The home brew supply stores don't even sell fermentation vessels at the prices you can get at the Korean markets. I got my fermentation jar at Kukje market. An equivalent stoneware fermentation crock with an air lock moat in which the lid rests (the traditional European design) typically costs between $80 and $200. For the price of the typical European style pickling crock, you can get ten of these jars and fill your pantry with pickled goodies. Besides being far less expensive, there are several reasons why I like the glass fermentation jar better.\nThese jars each come with a sturdy nylon jar sling, which makes them much easier to move around compared to a stoneware crock. With the nylon jar sling, you can easily move the jar into and out of your refrigerator, your pantry, or your fermentation room (if you're an enthusiast), or even take your kimchee to parties and potlucks.\nClear glass is totally inert, and guaranteed to be non-reactive. The glaze on stoneware may or may not contain lead or cadmium, which are toxic; you need to test any crock you buy to be sure. Some potters simply don't know with certainty what's in their glaze.\nGlass is transparent. I can see how my veggies are fermenting and marvel at the bubbles forming before my eyes, and can estimate how well fermented my food is without opening the lid and potentially contaminating the food.\nThe lid screws on, and the air lock cap can be swapped with the storage cap for refrigeration. Stoneware crocks don't have this feature.\nThe Korean markets also have smaller quart and pint sized fermentation jars with air-locks built in, all for surprisingly low prices. These work just as well for small pickle batches, and don't require as much overhead space as the water trap air lock mason jar conversions. If you are serious about fermenting vegetables, go to the Korean market or housewares store, and buy yourself a trunk-load of these jars. I don't think you'll find a better value anywhere for fermentation jars.\nLarge basins\nIn the photos, you'll see a couple of large stainless steel basins. These are not merely large kitchen prep bowls; the large one is more than double the capacity of the largest bowl could find at the cooking supply store. I got these at the Korean market for $30 and $40 respectively. They have them in stainless steel, aluminum, and plastic. I prefer stainless. I don't know of any other markets that sell large basins like these. These are used for salting the cabbage for kimchee, and perhaps for bathing small children. Get the largest basins you can; I originally only had the smaller of these two basins, and it proved to be too small; I was loosing bits of cabbage from the undersized basin as I tossed the cabbage to distribute the salt.\nFermentation weights\nThese are variously known as pressing stones, fermentation stones, or pickling weights. These are not traditionally used in the Korean method for making kimchee; these are from the European pickling tradition. The purpose of these weights is to keep the vegetables under the brine during fermentation, because mold cannot easily grow on liquids, and where it manages to grow on the surface, it can't easily send hyphae (mold roots) into the liquid. Keeping your sauerkraut or kimchee submerged under the brine is the best way to protect it against mold. I really like this optimization, and have adapted this for my kimchee method. If you don't use fermentation weights to keep the kimchee submerged, white mold may form on the bits that are sticking out of the liquid. There may even be some surface mold on the liquid. Do not be alarmed; the white molds that are able to withstand the acidity of the brine are not harmful; they're just not the kind of fermentation we're trying to promote in kimchee. Pick off or skim off any white mold and dispose of it, and carry on. However, if you get green or black or other colored molds, you should probably discard your kimchee and start over.\nFermentation weights come in a couple of styles. There are circular ones that are about 2\"-3\" in diameter made of glass or stoneware which are intended for weighing down vegetables being fermented in canning jars, and larger half-circle stones which are much heavier, intended for pressing down sauerkraut in a fermenting crock. The large half-circles are the ones you need for this project. I obtained mine from Amazon for about $22. (I later found these for $7 at Williams Sonoma, which was rather surprising. It's not often that you find things at Williams Sonoma that are a fraction of the cost of the same at Amazon.) These fermentation weights are sized for a 5 liter fermentation crock, and fit my inexpensive glass fermentation jar perfectly.\nSterilizing your fermentation weights\nThe fermentation weights that will fit your 5 liter jar are likely to be made of unglazed stoneware, and must be sterilized. Because the stoneware is porous, it could harbor unwanted microbes, which could form colonies and get a head start before the beneficial bacteria become thoroughly established enough to ward off competing microbes. To prevent any unwanted microbes from contaminating your kimchee, wash all your jars and bowls and food processor with hot water and dish soap. The fermentation weights, however, ought not be washed with dish soap because they are porous, and may hold onto soap residue that will ruin the flavor of your kimchee. It is sufficient to wash them with water before sterilizing them. I have not found it necessary to do a full sterilization of the jar, its lid, the basin, etc. because these surfaces are not porous.\nSteam is superior to boiling for sterilization\nI find that for sterilizing things for fermentation, steam is advantageous for the following reasons:\nYou can steam-sterilize anything from a single fermentation stone to a whole set of tools using just a pint of water. As long as the steam can reach its surfaces, it can sterilize the germs that are on those surfaces. This saves water, which is important for areas under drought conditions. (At the time of this writing, California is suffering from its worst drought in recent history.)\nIt takes very little time and energy to boil the small amount of water that it takes to steam your tools. For sterilizing my fermentation weights, it took less than 1 pint or so; enough to cover the bottom of your pot by 1/2\" should be enough. Compare that with how much time and energy it takes to boil enough water to cover all your tools; why waste more time, gas, or electricity to do the same job? A pint of water comes to a boil in about a minute.\nWhen water vapor condenses on something in the course of steaming, it not only happens at boiling temperature, it also imparts the quantity of energy it took to vaporize the water. Because of this, steam cooks any unwanted microbes to death very rapidly. Five minutes of steaming is more than enough. Leave your fermentation stones to cool with the lid on; by the time you are ready to use them, they will be cool enough to handle.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F6D/TKMA/HY5NTUW6/F6DTKMAHY5NTUW6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH0/229Q/HYZX4NHY/FH0229QHYZX4NHY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRF/6X2I/HYZX4O54/FRF6X2IHYZX4O54.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU1/HFQD/HY5NU07P/FU1HFQDHY5NU07P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F84/7UBG/HY5NU016/F847UBGHY5NU016.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMH/MT08/HY5NTV0G/FMHMT08HY5NTV0G.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Equipment for Making Kimchee"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Produce\nI stuck to simple ratios; kimchee is pretty forgiving, and natural ratios are the most convenient to work with anyways.\nThree small Napa cabbages, or two medium ones. The ones pictured are small.\none bunch of scallions\none bunch of Lacinato kale (I haven't tried using curly kale, but I don't think it has the right texture.)\none daikon radish (I use the green top variety, since this is what the Korean markets sell.)\none head of garlic, two if you really like garlic\none onion\ntwo asian pears (or one large one; the ones at the Korean market tend to be huge; we will only be using one and a half of the ones shown in the photo.)\nNapa cabbage is also known Chinese cabbage (\u5927\u767d\u83dc, literally \"big white vegetable\"), which is popular throughout east Asia. In Japan, it is known as Hakusai, and in Korea it is known as Won Bok. The Napa cabbage that I got at Berkeley Bowl was relatively small compared to the ones at the Kukje market. At the Kukje market, the Napa cabbages were the size of watermelons.\nThe asian pear provides some sugar to help with the fermentation process. Alternatively, you can use one and a half teaspoons of sugar.\nOther ingredients\n1/2-3/4 cup of Salt. Use kosher salt or sea salt; regular iodized salt is unpleasant.\nFish sauce. You'll be using between 1/3 cup and 3/4 cups\nKorean red pepper flakes. You'll need about a cup of this.\nSalted tiny shrimp (I'm guessing these are the same things as krill). About two teaspoons per 2 pounds of cabbage.\nFish sauce, tiny salted shrimp, and the Umami flavor\nFish sauce and salted shrimp may seem like odd things to add to fermenting cabbage. (In fact, this kimchee recipe is technically not vegetarian because of these ingredients.) Indeed, if you taste or smell these ingredients on their own, they are extremely intense and even pungent or fishy to the point of being unpleasant. However, when added to a large quantity of cabbage to be fermented into kimchee, they add a distinct dimension to the flavor that cannot be achieved without ingredients that impart glutamate. The fish sauce and the tiny salted shrimp add the flavor known as umami, which our tongue actually has the capacity to taste. For those who are not familiar with this flavor, umami can be best approximated by the word \"savory\". The flavor itself is carried by the neurotransmitter glutamate present in certain foods, and by nucleotides present in our food. Food items which are more familiar in western cuisines such as parmesan cheese, tomato paste, stewed meat, egg yolks, and anchovies are rich in glutamate. When tasted, this neurotransmitter jumps up and down on your tastebuds and screams \"FLAVOR! FLAVOR! FLAVOR!\" and enhance the other flavors in the food.\nYou've probably heard the term 'glutamate' in the context of monosodium glutamate, a.k.a. MSG, which is a salt made from glutamate extracted from yeast or kelp. (It is only in the form of a salt when dry; as soon as it contacts water, it dissociates into sodium and glutamate.) Using MSG to put glutamate into your food in order to get that savory taste is cheating. Real good cooks know how to find natural sources of glutamate by picking great ingredients. Glutamate is not bad for you in the quantities that naturally occur in food (which can be quite a lot); you cannot be allergic to the most common neurotransmitter in your body.\nThe spices, added flavors, and umami aspect of kimchee are what really set it apart from sauerkraut. Under conditions of scarcity where I might not have anything to eat but pickled vegetables, kimchee is flavorful enough that I could probably subsist on kimchee and rice without getting too bored. I have a hard time imagining myself doing the same with sauerkraut.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7R/MCG4/HY5NTUXZ/F7RMCG4HY5NTUXZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFR/3C7C/HY5NTUWN/FFR3C7CHY5NTUWN.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Ingredients for Making Kimchee"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Overview\nUnlike sauerkraut, which ferments in its own juices which are drawn out with salt, kimchee involves wilting the cabbage and discarding the juices drawn out by salt, and substituting in other fermentables in the form of a flavored paste that is rubbed into the cabbage. Because of this step, kimchee is denser than sauerkraut, and somewhat drier. The flavor is correspondingly more intense. It also ferments faster.\nIf you've ever followed some of the kimchee recipes for those mason jar pickling kits, they usually recommend putting your veggie mix into the jar and topping it off with brine. This is the wrong way to do kimchee; do not do this. Or if you do, at least don't call it kimchee. The proper way is to wilt the leaf matter with salt, discard the brine, and to rub in a flavored paste.\nCut up the cabbage and pick the layers apart; remove bug bitten parts\nCut up the kale into thirds, and remove the central vein; remove bug bitten parts\nToss the vegetables with 3/4 cups of salt and leave to wilt for 2-3 hours, mixing once every half hour to distribute the brine\nCut up the cabbage and pick the layers apart\nSet aside 1/2 to 3/4 cups of kosher salt or fine sea salt. This does not represent how much salt ends up in the kimchee; you will be rinsing off the cabbage after it has wilted.\nCut the cabbage in half, and then in quarters, cutting along the length of the cabbage. Then, cut each of those quarters into four or five segments. The very bottom segment will have the heart of the cabbage, where all the leaves are attached. You will need to cut the cabbage heart out.\nPick out any portion of leaves that look bug bitten. You need not discard the whole leaf. Don't be alarmed at a few leaves having a few munches; this is virtually unavoidable with napa cabbage. In fact, I would be a bit suspicious if the cabbage had absolutely no bug bites unless the cabbage was grown in a hydroponic greenhouse. Having absolutely no bug bites would suggest to me that perhaps a lot of pesticides were used. If your cabbage is badly bug-eaten, toss it and get another, but a few munches on a few of the outer leaves is not a problem.\nThe layers of the cabbage are going to be naturally stuck together. Pick the layers apart over your large basin, and sprinkle a bit of salt each time you add more cabbage to the basin.\nCut the kale and remove the central vein\nGive your kale a quick wash with water, then cut your lacinato kale into thirds, and use your hands to peel the leaf matter off of the stiff central vein, which has an unpleasant texture. Tear off any bits that are bug bitten, or which might have bugs hiding on the underside. (This is not uncommon, but it is also nothing to be alarmed about. Kale is good stuff, and the bugs instinctively know this.) Tear any large pieces into more bite sized pieces, and put all of this in your basin. As I mentioned before, in my opinion, curly kale doesn't have the right texture for kimchee; Lacinato kale (also known as Tuscan kale or dinosaur kale) is more suitable.\nToss the vegetables with salt and leave to wilt for 2-3 hours\nToss the kale and cabbage leaves together with the remaining portion of your salt to distribute the salt evenly. I used about 3/4 cups of salt for three small Napa cabbages; as long as you don't use an excessive amount or too little, this step is fairly tolerant of variations of up to a quarter cup in the amount of salt you use to wilt the cabbage; at the end you will be rinsing off the excess salt. Leave the cabbage and kale to wilt for 2-3 hours, tossing the mix a couple of times in the process. After about an hour, a lot of moisture will have been drawn out of the cabbage, forming a brine that collects at the bottom of the basin. Toss the cabbage and kale to coat the pieces that are under-wilted with this brine; this will ensure even wilting. The longer you let your cabbage wilt, the more moisture will be drawn out. Give the cabbage no less than 2 hours; 3 hours will give you a more complete wilting.\nWhile the cabbage and kale are wilting, you should prepare the rest of the vegetables and the flavored paste for the kimchee.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8C/QFIP/HYO8MC5R/F8CQFIPHYO8MC5R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD9/CBJ0/HYPO2XAK/FD9CBJ0HYPO2XAK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBS/2AKD/HYO8MEBA/FBS2AKDHYO8MEBA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQS/TAA0/HY5NTVJ4/FQSTAA0HY5NTVJ4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F42/OJBY/HYPO306B/F42OJBYHYPO306B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEV/VQWV/HYPO3FVG/FEVVQWVHYPO3FVG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEV/RTFS/HYPO3JOB/FEVRTFSHYPO3JOB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Cut Up the Cabbage and Kale and Wilt the Leaves With Salt"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Trim off the roots of the scallions, and cut them into 1.5 inch long pieces.

Cutting them into matchsticks gives the daikon a nice texture and mouth-feel, and increases the surface area to volume ratio, which makes it faster to ferment the pieces all the way through.\nI'm a bit obsessive about the craftsmanship of whatever I make, so I go to a bit more trouble to produce a consistent matchstick cut.\nNote: The daikon I obtained was way larger than what I needed for this recipe. I only ended up using about a quarter of it. If you really like daikon, feel free to use more. If you use the whole thing, it won't all fit into the jar with enough room for the fermentation weights.\nMy method: use mandoline slicer, followed by manual slicing\nI used a mandoline slicer to slice a few layers off the daikon to give it a flat side so it wouldn't roll around on the cutting board, then I cut it to a square cross-sectioned billet. (If you can't do this easily with a chef's knife, plane the daikon down to a square cross-section using the mandoline.) I then I sliced the daikon billet into uniform slices with the mandoline set to make 3mm slices. I then stacked up the slices and cut them into matchsticks by hand. This is pretty labor intensive. Be very careful with the mandoline; wear cut-resistant gloves if you need to. It is very easy to injure yourself with these.\nSet this aside in a bowl; we will mix this with the rest of the ingredients later.\nMandonline tip: Turn whatever you're slicing 180\u02da every few slices\nWhen using the mandoline, after every few slices, turn the thing you're slicing 180\u02da to slice it from the opposite direction. You should do this because most mandolines have an angled blade, and the planing platform has a bit of flex to it; these two factors cause the slices to have a subtle wedge shape due to the bias in the cut. This bias is in two directions; the flexibility of the planing platform introduces a bias that goes up-down, and the angle in the blade introduces a bias that goes left-right. Every couple of 180\u02da turns, turn whatever you're slicing 90\u02da in order to cancel out the bias in the left-right direction as well.\nIf you don't reverse the direction of the cut once in a while to correct for the slicing bias, you'll find that the surface of the cut will become more and more angled, resulting in wasted material at the end which is too angled to get the beautiful consistent slices that you're using mandoline to achieve to begin with.\nShortcut: use a julienne peeler or a daikon lathe\nI don't have either of these tools, but if you do, save yourself some labor and use these to cut your daikon into little strips. The daikon lathe will reduce your daikon into long square cross-sectioned filaments very rapidly. You should use a knife or scissors to cut this daikon floss into shorter segments about 2-3\" long. (Japanese restaurants use the either this kind of lathe or a rotary daikon shredder to make that daikon floss which they use as a garnish.)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZQ/7JQD/HYWT7JP8/FZQ7JQDHYWT7JP8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEO/GEHD/HYWT7RP1/FEOGEHDHYWT7RP1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB0/YRCZ/HYWT80TB/FB0YRCZHYWT80TB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Julienne the Daikon Radish"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "The kimchee sauce is a blended paste consisting of pear, onion, garlic, salted shrimp paste, fish sauce, and Korean red pepper flakes. The steps involved can be pretty succinctly summarized:\nWash, cut, and core one pear, then cut into chunks\nPeel and cut the onion into chunks. Remove root portion.\nPeel 6-8 cloves of garlic\nPut all of the above and 2 tsp. of salted shrimp into the food processor. Pulse the food processor until a coarse paste is formed, then process on full power until the coarse paste becomes a fine paste.\nTransfer the paste to your other large basin, and add 2/3 cup of fish sauce (or as much as 3/4 cup, if you like extra savory kimchee) and 1 cup of Korean red pepper flakes. Stir all of this together until evenly blended.\nMix the daikon and scallion with the sauce in the basin.\nNote: in the photos, I bought two heads of garlic, but I peeled one whole head and used every single clove in the sauce. This proved to be too much garlic; the flavor was not as balanced as a good kimchee should be, and was overly dominated by the garlic notes. Eight of the outer cloves of one head of garlic should suffice.\nNote: I used one and a half small Asian pears, but if you happen to have one of the large ones, one should suffice.\nGarlic peeling trick\nIf you need to peel a lot of garlic, as you would for this recipe, do this trick. You can peel a whole head of garlic in a few second this way. I attempted to do this with smaller bowls, and it didn't work as well. Larger metal bowls work best. Peeling your own garlic is a lot cheaper than buying pre-peeled garlic, and the garlic will be fresher.\nBest way to core a pear: use a mellon baller\nIn the photos for this step, I used a paring knife to cut the core out of the pear, because I didn't have my preferred tool for the job on hand. The fastest and least wasteful way to core pears and apples is to use the large end of a mellon baller, as shown in this video.\nPear, onion, and garlic serve as fermentation boosters\nObserve that the pear, the onion, and the garlic used in kimchee are food-processed into a paste rather than kept in identifiable chunks. This is because these ingredients serve as fermentation boosters, and work best in this capacity when blended into a paste. When this paste is spread on all of the vegetables, the sugars in the pear and prebiotic fiber in the onion and garlic feed the probiotics in the cabbage and help them rapidly multiply and dominate the kimchee. The sugars in the pear also feed some of the yeast present in the cabbage; the trace amounts of alcohol produced by the yeast are then converted into flavorful acids by the bacteria.\nRemember my description of fermentation as human intervention into a three way war between yeast, bacteria, and molds? Think of these fermentation boosters as reinforcements that we send to the bacteria and the yeast. Consider the fact that Kimchee ferments to readiness in about a week, whereas sauerkraut takes several weeks to a month or so to finish fermenting. I suspect the use of the fermentation boosting effect of the pear/onion/garlic paste in kimchee may be the reason behind the difference in fermentation time.\nNote: if you watched the \"Kimchi Party\" video that's been going around, you may have noticed that their recipe included a paste made of rice powder. I suspect this is also a fermentation booster. I wouldn't know how much rice powder to use, and none of the recipes that I've found included this ingredient. My recipe worked out quite well without it. Their recipe also uses pineapple instead of Asian pears. I've also seen apples or just a couple of teaspoons of sugar used as the sweet portion of the fermentation booster.

If you taste a piece from the bottom of the basin, where all the brine accumulates, you'll get a sense of how salty it is. A bit of the salt diffuses into the leaves, but the rest of it, contained in the brine, must be rinsed off, or the kimchee may end up too salty. Before seasoning the veggies with the sauce you prepared in the previous step (which contains some salt from the fish sauce and the salted shrimp), rinse the excess salt from the veggies, and spin-dry them with the salad spinner. The best way to rinse the cabbage thoroughly is to use a mesh strainer to hold the cabbage and kale under running water while fluffing the leaves with your hand.

Remember; we're trying to get a nice cap of liquid over the kimchee, and we also don't want any air bubbles in the mixture at the beginning. Bubbles of carbon dioxide will form as the fermentation progresses, but our objective is to initially press all the air out because we want the beneficial bacteria in the cabbage to quickly dominate the kimchee, while suppressing mold. Mold cannot grow under liquid; mold needs a surface to grow on.\nTo do this, I pour some liquid from the bottom of the basin of the sauced mixture into the jar before pushing the vegetables into the jar. As I stuff the vegetables in, I push it down with my fist to force any air that may be trapped between the leaves to bubble out; the liquid re-settles and fills most of the voids.\n(I recognize that not everyone optimizes this process as much as I'm trying to, but I don't want to do anything risky when fermenting. I imagine one bad batch could cause you to be turned off to fermenting your own foods, and that would be a very unfortunate thing.)\nAdd the fermentation weights\nThe level of the vegetables should not go higher than the shoulder of the jar. You should have at least an inch and a half of clearance under the shoulder for the fermentation weights. If you have too much kimchee to fit in the jar with enough clearance for the weights, feel free to eat whatever won't fit. (Or use a smaller fermentation weight that sits in the neck of the jar.)\nTake your fermentation weights (which should be sterilized and cooled down by this point) and insert them one half at a time into the jar.

Put the jar roughly over the middle (it doesn't matter if it the jar sits over part of the perimeter strap), and pull up on the handles while pushing down on the jar. Then, turn the jar 90\u02da and pull the perimeter strap up to make sure the sling is snugly fitted on the jar.\nThe perimeter strap must be on the outside to ensure a tight fit; if you have the sling inside out, the vertical straps won't push out on the perimeter strap, and the sling will sag.\nPrime the air lock\nOnce the jar sling is fitted, transport the kimchee to where you're going to leave it to ferment before priming the air lock; transporting the jar with water sloshing around in the moat of the airlock is annoying. (I like to observe my kimchee because I'm fascinated by these things, so I leave mine on the counter top.) Once in place, prime the moat around the air lock with a little bit of water; you only need enough water to cover over the holes at the base of the air lock with enough to compensate for a bit of evaporation. Having too much water in the air lock just makes it a messy hassle to open the jar later on.\nThe air lock lets the gases produced during fermentation bubble out while preventing flies and mold spores from getting into the jar.

The primary change in the character of the kimchee imparted by fermentation is acidity; the kimchee develops a slightly sour flavor (roughly akin to sauerkraut) and more complex fragrances than were there before fermentation. Also, the somewhat tough crunchy parts of the cabbage become much more tender.\nAt that point, you have several options:\nYou can remove the fermentation weights and start serving it as a side dish, while re-capping it after each time you access it, letting it continue to ferment. As it continues to ferment, the flavor profile changes. It gets a bit more sour, and the flavor changes in ways that are subtle and hard to describe.\nYou can remove the fermentation weights, and swap the air lock cap for the sealing cap, then refrigerate your kimchee, and serve from the jar as needed\nHow long does kimchee last?\nHonestly, I don't know from experinece how long home made kimchee lasts. No batch that I've made and kept around has had anything left beyond a week. However, based on the fact that some of the \u00fcber traditional methods leave the kimchee fermenting for over a month unrefrigerated, I suspect it will last at least that long; refrigerating it is likely to make it last even longer. Do keep in mind that really old kimchee is likely to be very sour. If anything, that acidity is probably why it doesn't spoil.\nWhat can you do with your kimchee besides eating it as a side dish?\nChop it up and use it as the vegetable portion of your Asian dumpling stuffings.\nMake savory kimchee pancakes. (I will make an instructable for this one of these days.)\nChop it up and serve it with sausages on a bun as a substitute for sauerkraut.\nMake kimchee stew, a traditional Korean dish.\nConclusion\nI hope you enjoyed this instructable and the primer on fermentation. Remember: may other things can be fermented. It is a healthy, delicious, and low-energy way of preserving your food without refrigeration.

With only minor alterations (and the addition of a spreadsheet), it's from Isa Chandra Moskowitz's wonderful cookbook, Vegan with a Vengeance.* That's also the secret: the best pancakes I know how to make happen to be vegan!

With a little help from the spreadsheet and a scale, you can then make these pancakes in one bowl in record time. Post your best times in the comments (measured from when you have a clean bowl to when the first pancake is finished)!\nNow, enjoy your banana pancakes and congratulate yourself on having not wasted any bananas. Be warned, however, if you cook these enough times, you will start buying bananas and neglecting them, just for an excuse to stock your freezer with more awesome homemade pancakes. If you make a batch of these yourself, please post in the comments and let everyone know how your pancakes turned out!\n* Although recipes are not eligible for copyright protection in the United States, I believe strongly in offering credit where credit is due and supporting the people who invent and publish great recipes.

It seems like totally the wrong way to make yeasted bread: not using bread flour, not using a mixer or breadmaker, not kneading the dough, not proofing the dough, not preheating the oven...

I like to add most of the water first, stir a little, then add the remaining. Form a sticky dough. I use a spoon to mix not my hands.\nDivide into 12 dough balls (or 8 if you prefer) by using a digital scale. Each portion should weigh about 30 grams. If you don't have a digital scale, just eyeball them. Spoon onto the tray that has been lined with non stick parchment (important - must be non-stick silicone coated. Alternatively, use foil generously greased with vegetable oil).\nUsing the spoon, coated with little bit of vegetable oil to prevent sticking, shape each portion into more 'ball-like' shapes. Cut a cross on top with the spoon if you like. This will flatten the dough ball a bit and create more ridges and crunch in the end result.\nFOR THE BUTTER TOP VERSION:\nPlace a little piece of butter on top of each dough ball.\nFOR THE GARLIC CHEESE VERSION:\nPlace a very little piece of butter on top of each dough ball.\nSqueeze on garlic puree and a sprinkle of dried parsley. If you prefer to use fresh garlic and herbs, go ahead.\nTop with a little piece of cheddar cheese. The cheese protects the garlic from burning, so it's important to put on last. Use real cheese, not processed.\nBAKING DIRECTIONS:\nPlace the dough balls on the middle shelf of a *not preheated* oven. On the bottom shelf, place a small ramekin or any other oven-safe vessel containing 2cm of water.\nTurn the oven on to 220 C (430 F) or 200 C (400 F) for a fan oven.\nBaking time varies depending on your oven. I suggestion however long for your oven to come up to temperature PLUS 8-12 minutes. For mine, they take 20 minutes (my oven reaches temperature in about 9 minutes, and I bake for 11 minutes more). But if your oven takes longer to reach 220/200, maybe you won't need as much as 8-12 after that, so just look for golden-brownness...\nAnd they're ready! They're best eaten hot and fresh out of the oven. They'll become a bit dry the next day.\nTake a look at the video, that may help clarify some of the steps.

No oven, no microwave, no cooker, (almost) no washing up! 3 ingredients (with 2 more optional ones), super easy. They're nutty and rich, but not overly sweet. The texture is very interesting, creamy and a little fudgy and crunchy at the the same time.\nAll details are in the video above. Please take a look. Or follow the simple written instructions below:\nIngredients:\n120 g (4 & 1/4 oz) Digestive biscuits (or graham crackers or some other cookies)\n100 g (3 & 1/2 oz) White chocolate\n100 g (3 & 1/2 oz) Crunchy peanut butter\n40 g (1 & 1/2 oz) Raisins or sultanas - Optional\n1 piece of digestive biscuit & sprinkle of powdered sugar - Optional\nStep 1: Put the cookies / biscuits in a bag and break into a mixture of small pieces and crumbs. I just break by hand, like popping bubble wraps, very therapeutic :o). Or you can use a rolling pin.\nStep 2: Line a metal baking tray with aluminium foil. I use a loaf pan that has a 20 x 10 cm base. If you wan to make a bigger batch, use a wider tray. In the video, I demonstrated an easy way of lining the pan. Put the white chocolate (break into pieces if it's a bar) and peanut butter in the lined tray.\nStep 3: I melt the choco & PB using a hair dryer! It take 3-4 minutes on a medium setting for me. If you don't want to use a hair dryer, you can use the oven instead.\nStep 4: A quick stir of the choco & PB. Add the crushed cookies / biscuits. And the raisins / sultanas, if using. Or you can add peanuts or mini chocolate chips. Stir well to combine, take care not to break the foil. Press into an even-ish layer. Totally optional - I crumble over a piece of biscuit and a sprinkle of powdered sugar on top, just to make it look a little prettier :o).\nStep 5: Cover and leave in the fridge to set for an hour. Take out of the tray, cut into pieces, and enjoy! Store any leftovers in the fridge (if you don't eat them all in one go, that is).\nIf you have enjoyed this recipe, please 'follow' me and check out my other instructables.

So it is time to try something new and exciting -- watermelon bread!\nThe fruit content allows the otherwise plain wheat loaf to retain extra moisture, thus preventing the bread from becoming dry and uninteresting as quickly as it normally would. So even though this melon braid is best the same day it is baked, it can also be eaten the next day, while the third day finds it still moist but somewhat crumbly.\nThe watermelon adds a delicate pinkish-orange color and subtle sweetness to the bread, making it well suited for special occasions as well as a family table surprise. The braided shape makes it look extra spectacular, but the dough can also be made into a plain loaf, which will in no way diminish the flavor of the bread. If a bread pan is not available, the dough can be placed on a floured baking sheet, in which case the loaf will just become a little flatter. The watermelon adds natural sweetness to the bread, but since the yeast eats sugar as food, it is necessary to add some extra sweetener, together with a little oil for extra soft moistness -- soft, watermelony moistness.\nNow, the thing is that you might also get tired of watermelon bread, so what do you do?

It brings back such good memories for me. It's also super cheap, uber healthy, and keeps for the better part of a year if you are good to it! It's my hope that this instructable brings people to try sauerkraut for themselves and start new family meal traditions. Or at the very least put it on a hotdog.\nFor those of you who have never had sauerkraut before, the name means \"sour cabbage\". It's made by a process called lacto-fermentation, the same good stuff happens to give us yoghurt. When combined with salt, it pulls the moisture from the cabbage creating a brine. In the brine, nothing but the strongest survive. The bacteria known as lactobacillus eat all the sugars in the cabbage and burp it into lactic acid-- which preserves the cabbage for a long time and gives it a unique, sour taste! Its high in fibre, vitamin B6, vitamin C, Iron and is generally good for your gut.\nHardware:\n- large cutting board\n- chef knife\n- large mixing bowl, or very clean bucket\n- 1 x 4 qt. mason jar, or 4 x 1 qt mason jars\n- parchment paper, or keep one large, clean outer leaf of the green cabbage\n- small patch of cheesecloth and a rubber band or string\nSoftware:\n- 1 large head green cabbage (about 3 pounds)\n- 1 medium head of purple cabbage\n- 3 tbsp kosher or sea salt\n- 1 cup water\n- 1 tbsp caraway seeds (optional, for flavor)\nInstructions:\nClean and sanitize your cutting board, knife, mixing bowls/bucket, mason jars, with very hot soapy water.\nQuarter each head of cabbage. Slice along the bias to make very thin strands of cabbage about 2mm thick.\nDump cabbage into your mixing bowl or bucket. Sprinkle salt over top, and begin mixing it into the cabbage with your very clean hands. You may want to wear gloves, because the purple cabbage can stain your fingers!\nGently massage the salt in for about 10 minutes, pressing and squeezing the cabbage until it starts to become limp, and water begins to leach out of it. Add caraway seeds if you're into it.\nPack it into your jar, pressing down firmly to really press it down. Add any liquid left in the bucket, and an additional cup of water.\nPress a piece of parchment paper over top of the cabbage, submerging it down under the liquid in the jar. Alternatively you can use a large outer leaf left over from the cabbage if you want to be all old school about it.\nCover the jar. You want to allow some air flow, but still keep stuff from getting into it so you can use a piece of cheesecloth and a rubber band if you'd like. I just put the lid on mine, it doesnt seal very tightly anymore so it worked fine.\nKeep the jar in a dark, room temperature place, between 55-75F.\nOver the next day, whenever you remember try to press down on the cabbage every so often. It will become limper and more liquid will be squeezed out of the plant fibers, keeping it submerged.\nIf after 24 hours, the liquid has not risen above the cabbage, dissolve 1 teaspoon of salt ina cup of water and add it to submerge the cabbage.\nThe cabbage will take atleast 3 days to start fermenting. Check your batch atleast once a day, making sure everything is submerged.\nOnce you decide it's tasty enough, move your jar to the back of your fridge and put a proper lid on it.

It is called \"watermelon steak\" due to its appearance and texture. If the steak are baked, a raw fish like texture can result. When well cooked, most of the fruit's water evaporates. This concentrates flavor and texture, yet still leaves the steak tender and juicy, \"kind of like a fillet steak\" . Cook books sometimes suggest watermelon steak as a meat substitute for vegetarians.Some recipes involve serving the steaks uncooked; once the raw watermelon is cut into steak like slices, it can be garnished with various condiments or simply served together with salad.

Wild salmon also supports 137 other species from killer whales to osprey to seals to caddisflies, so they are critical connectors of ecosystems, from salt water, to rivers, and the land.\nSalmon are born in freshwater, and after a year or so in the river, migrate downstream to salt water. King salmon is most common on the California Coast. They live 5-7 years in total, before migrating back to their streams where they spawn, die, and their decomposing bodies fertilize plankton to feed their offspring the next spring.\nWhat salmon share with us through their deaths goes beyond feeding their own offspring. Salmon are an integral part of many food webs, as they are, along with steelhead trout, the only fish that bring nutrients from the sea to the land. Bear and eagles take these creatures from the water to the through forests. Gulls and crows scavenge the parts that the eagles and osprey don\u2019t eat. And all the birds scatter the minerals and nutrients the salmon bring from the ocean to the land, helping to fertilize the surrounding trees and plants forests, which in turn help clean run-off to the rivers and provides shade for returning salmon.\nThese are amazing animals, and a really sustainable seafood choice. But to show them respect, and do ourselves a favor, it\u2019s best to eat the whole fish-not just slice off a few prime fillets and waste the rest. By eating the whole fish, we come to know it intimately. You get more of the potent oils when you eat the eggs. If you treat the skin like fish bacon, you\u2019ll soak up healthy fats stored in it. The head, normally thrown away will make a tasty soup that is literally brain food\u2014it will make you smarter and help keep dementia at bay. The belly is prime fare; since it\u2019s so fatty it\u2019s a motherlode of Omega-3\u2019s and the bones add calcium to your diet.

It is fed by the cooler air that flows in along the lower half of the cavity. The hot air and smoke rises to the top of the dome, and is then drawn out along the top half of the cavity through the chimney. The hot air in the dome causes heat to be radiated back to the ground and any pizza that may find itself in its way....\n\nThat takes care of the top of the pizza. The bottom layer in the oven is a material of high thermal mass (thick terracotta tiles in our case) that is heated up by the radiation from the dome and also by the conduction of heat from the fire. A porous clay-based material like terracotta is ideal as it temporarily absorbs moisture from the pizza base, which helps to give you a crispy pizza base. We intend to make proper pizzas here, not the thick, soggy things that those multinationals dish up, after all.\n\nThe fire is started in front part of the oven, and when it is ablaze, it is pushed into the back. The fire may appear to momentarily die because of the lack of oxygen, but the convection process starts to work within seconds and it grows again. The secret of keeping the fire going it to regularly feed it small amounts of wood, preferably using long tongs so that you can place the wood on top of the burning embers. You can test the convection process by dropping a few drops of water on the bottom layer of the oven: the resulting vapour should move into the oven towards the fire, not the other way around as you would normally expect.\n\nThere is no hard and fast rule of determining when the oven is hot enough. I just know it is ready for use when it feels much hotter than my domestic oven set to maximum temperature. I also measure the exhaust temperature on the chimney and when it exceeds 300 DegC (because that is how my temperature measuring device will go), then I know that the internal heat is well above that we are ready to go.\n\nWhen the oven is ready, the cooking surface needs to be prepared by sweeping the any ashes either into the fire or out of the entrance using a natural bristle broom dipped in water. Then use a wet floor mop to pick up the remaining ashes off the cooking surface. You can also wrap a wet rag around the broom for the same effect.\n\nYou are now ready to bake your pizza.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FH1/IKG9/GT2P3C36/FH1IKG9GT2P3C36.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: How Does It Work?"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Some design thoughts\nA bread-baking oven typically has a thick internal layer made from a solid, heat-retaining material (i.e. a high thermal mass ) that will hold the heat for 3 hours or so. The idea is that you make a fire in it, let it heat up, and then scrape the embers out and put your dough in and close the door and let the bread bake. A pizza oven, on the other hand, has a fire burning in it - or has at least glowing embers in it - while the pizza bakes. It does not need a thermal capacitor like a bread-baking oven, but it needs to run much hotter. Both types of approaches require a good, heat-resistant insulator. This design serves the needs of both the pizza baker and the bread baker, by having an inner layer of material with a high thermal mass, and a surrounding heat-resistant insulation layer. The better the insulation, the less heat can escape, so you will get optimal energy from your fuel.\n\nThe Design\nThe outside of the oven is made of three layers and each layer serves a distinct function:\n1. Inner layer: Clay mixed with sand. This is a refractory material, i.e. it can withstand high heat. It is also brittle and needs to be protect by the outter layers. This layer has a high heat capacity and therefore helps to even spread heat and to radiate heat back into the centre of the oven. It is about 3cm thick.\n2. Middle, insulation layer. This layer must be heat proof and also act as an insulator. The choice of materials was a vermiculite (a.k.a. \"Perlite\") bonded with clay. It is about 10cm thick. This layer also provides the first bit of structural strength to the design.\n3. Outter shell. Since every bit of insulation helps, this layer is also made from vermiculite, however, it is bonded with cement, which makes the shell rock hard. Since it does not get too hot on this layer, it is acceptable to use cement, which would flake and loose strength under high heat.\n4. Weather-proofing layer: A layer of external cement will keep the worst moisture out when it rains, but allow the clay to continue to dry out as it ages. One could also tile the outside for decorative effect.\n\nThe inner height of the entrance must be 63.9% of the inner height of the dome at its highest point. Who and how this was calculated remains a mystery to me.\n\nA chimney that can provide a good draft is required to help draw the hot air and smoke from the oven, so as a rule of thumb, the chimney should be at least the height of the inner dome height.\n\nNote to Academics, Engineers and other wonderful mathematically-inspired types:\nI made no formal calculations, even though I did once do courses in thermodynamics and structural engineering at university. Regrettably, beer was more interesting at that time. After one year and regular use, the structural design held up pretty well.\nIt is also unlikely that this oven will ever be hot enough to fire low-temperature clay pottery - I have tried.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F35/9989/GSLF2YKH/F359989GSLF2YKH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPD/LWY3/GSLF1HNY/FPDLWY3GSLF1HNY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: The Oven Design"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Make a wooden frame the size of the base of the oven.

In the end the former is also use to shape the doors for the wood storage bin and oven, using a router.

It is only a pizza oven and mistakes are not in any way affect the eventual function, but you might as well make it look professional...\n\nBecause my pizza oven is built into a slight mound, I created a crude damp-proofing barrier from some left-over packaging plastic and then backfilled with dirt and then trimmed the excess plastic off.\n\nLastly, top out the last course with mortar to create a level plane for laying the lintels on.

There was a lot of fitting and even more mortar to make it look respectable.

Add a spadeful of sharp sand to it to help with the chopping up to prevent it from annoyingly sticking to the spade. Leave the clay for a while to absorb more water.

It should be the consistency of double-thick cream.\n\nGently fold in 50 liters of vermiculite (half of a 100-liter bag) into the slurry in such a way that the vermiculite is fully coated by the slurry but does not get compressed - this is a bit like folding beaten egg-white into a souffl\u00e9 mixture, actually. You will need to repeat this 5 or 6 times to make enough insulation mixture, or if you have a large enough mixing container and are feeling brave, do it all in one go.\n\nPlace 5 cm high mounds on the outside of the dome to act as a thickness guide. Now use your hands and pack the clay and vermiculite mixture over the dome. The mixture is surprisingly mouldable and elastic. If it is too stiff, wet it with some water. It will all eventually evaporate in any case. However, be careful not to press it down too hard, or you will squeeze all the air out of the vermiculite which will cause to to loose its insulation property. Come compression is unavoidable.\n\nFinish off the dome by smoothing it with your hands or a plasterer's float. Using your hands is more fun! When using a float, remember to only ever move in an upwards direction, just like when you plaster a real wall. All in all, you should now have a total wall thickness - including the clay layer underneath - of about 8cm.\n\nAgain, let it dry in the sun for a few days. Cover with a plastic sheet if there is a chance of rain - it will still dry out nicely under there.

The yummy crumb on the outside, vanilla ice cream with a strawberry (though perhaps I should call it \"strawberry like?\") center inside, a great combination of flavors.\nMichael Symon came up with a way to re-create these bars sans the use of artificial flavors and colors, as that's how I prefer to eat these days, I gave it a go. I even went so far as to make my own strawberry sherbet (you can use store-bought if you prefer) because I had frozen local strawberries and knew they'd make these bars fantastic.

The \"hard\" part is waiting at least 4 hours for the flavors to meld and the bars to set before eating, but I assure you, this recipe is worth waiting for!\nStrawberry shortcake ice cream bars are truly a perfect summer treat that bring you right back to childhood, hearing the jingle of the ice cream truck, grabbing some change, and running to catch it.

I found some amazing bread at my local farmer's market, but you can use bread from wal-mart if you want to. It just decides the quality of your sandwich at the end, and since these are pretty simple, the key is to use higher quality ingredients for a better product. I used oat bread because it is slightly sweet and tastes similar to white bread, but has a chewiness to it that works well in this sandwich.\nYou'll also need chocolate- any variety will work (milk or dark, you could even try flavored chocolate!) chopped up or in chip form. Mix it with cream cheese: softened to room temperature for spread- and melt-ablity, just enough to bond the chocolate pieces together and create a spread. Spread the spread onto the bread (Dr. Suess, anyone?) and top with another slice to make a sandwich. Easy, right?\nNow mix together an egg, a few teaspoons of sugar, and some cream (~1.5 tbsp) in a bowl wide enough for the bread. Dip both sides of the sandwich in the mixture, making sure it soaks some of it up and wiping off extra. There will probably be enough egg mixture to make two sandwiches, depending on their size.\nMelt butter in a pan over medium or medium-high heat and fry the sandwich as you would french toast on both sides, until the egg is cooked and slightly browned.\nLastly, I like to serve the sandwich with powdered sugar and cocoa powder or shaved chocolate on top.

Trust me, if you like it cold, you'll love the warm version where the cheese is melty, the bread crispy and it's all cooked into perfection. This may be my favorite sandwich yet.\nThe other type of bread that I have is called \"veggie bread\", which means it is a whole wheat dough with onions, garlic, carrots and all sorts of savory vegetables in it that give it a great, mild flavor. This kind of bread is best toasted or, as the bread salesman at the farmer's market told us he preferred, as grilled cheese. That's actually how I thought of making this instructable in the first place ;) Any type of artisan bread or baguette will work, such as tomato basil.\nSo, you slice fresh mozzarella* and tomatoes- home grown or locally grown would taste great. I used store bought pesto that is very flavorful when purchased through a good brand, but you can use homemade if you like. Layer the mozzarella first on the bread, then tomatoes and pesto (I would be generous with the pesto- that's where most of the flavor comes from), then more mozzarella.\nYou can cook this sandwich in a panini press or on a grill, but I chose to use a skillet and olive oil. I pressed it down once in a while to meld everything together.

It just never did it for me.\nMaybe that was because I had never tried the quality kind, eaten the right way. Now I love using bacon for that smokey flavor and crunch, like I do in this sandwich. Plus, the grease can be used to fry the sandwich in! What could be better? That's right. Not much.\nSo fry the bacon and gather your ingredients. Don't forget to use a good-quality pan to make grilled cheese like this in- a cheap nonstick pan can give the bread a metallic, no-good flavor. Other ingredients are roasted red peppers, which you can chop up and add to the sandwich, and an egg. These are optional but very tasty and therefore recommended.\nShave the Parmesan and crumble the bacon. You can saute the spinach in a pan or microwave it for about 30 seconds until it wilts. Squeeze excess liquid from the spinach if there is any and chop it roughly. Layer the items the same way as the pesto sandwich was- cheese on the outside to hold it together and melt easily.\nNow cook the sandwich in the bacon drippings or however you want, making sure to press the sandwich in some way as Parmesan is a hard cheese and doesn't melt easily. I made it work with a heavy skillet on top over medium heat. Another option is to put a lid over the pan, on a lower heat, to let the heat circulate and melt the cheese.\nI didn't forget about that egg! Just fry it up over-easy and serve it on top. The soft yolk will add another yum factor to this sandwich, but it's good on it's own, too.

And once I get an idea, I can't get it out of my head until I try it. So here's a couple extra experiments that turned out pretty well.\nFirst, I tried lox. The classic open faced pumpernickel sandwiches were too tempting to ignore. I made grilled cheese versions with cocktail bread, chopped capers, dill, and chive-and-onion flavored cream cheese (from laughing cow, but regular cream cheese is fine too). You could also use red onion or tomato slices, according to your preference.\nSaute it in a generous amount of grapeseed or other light-tasting oil; the dry pumpernickel bread soaked up more than I thought it would. My salmon was grilled- using real smoked salmon would definitely amp up the flavor, but the result was still wonderful. Creamy cheese, salmon and the tangy flavors from the capers and dill. Even my pet parakeet couldn't stay away from it!\nSecond, a harvest grilled cheese sandwich. You can use pretty much any fresh vegetables that sound good or that you have on hand, and some pepper jack or sharp cheddar cheese. Try mushrooms, squash, tomatoes, onion, peppers, or corn. Just saute the vegetables and use them as fillings to the sandwich. If you use too much they will fall out the sides or may end up with a regular sandwich rather than a grilled cheese, but if you're OK with that then go for it! I encourage you to experiment with other fillings and flavorings, including spices as well.

Holdfasts anchor them to rocks and their blades flow with the currents. In addition to being beautiful, seaweed is naturally high in many vitamins and anti-oxidants. Seaweed is rich in magnesium, calcium and iron. It's high in iodine, omega 3's and rich in vitamins. In fact, it\u2019s one of the most nutritious things you can eat. These wonder algae have fertilized crops, saved populations from disease and hunger and are a very utilized wonder-food.\nResearch is also showing that the sex life of seaweed is rich and varied. Seaweed can be hermaphrodites, asexual, intergenerational, polyamorous, self-perpetuating, male-female traditional, and in winter-spring couples. Read more about this in the article \"Lolita of the Seaweed.\" It stands to reason that with such raucous sex lives, seaweed is a potent aphrodisiac. This is in part due to the high vitamin B which gives you energy and helps with hormone production. It's rich in iodine, which is libido boosting, good source of manganese, a mineral known to help maintain a healthy sex drive.\nIt's even more libido boosting if you go forage it yourself. Imagine early morning at the beach, the excitement of the hunt, and escaping the impact zones just as waves crash. In Northern California, where I'm located, summer is prime foraging time, as seaweed has large blades during this time to absorb sunlight, and in the winter, they stay small to survive the storms.\nYou only want to harvest on low tide when the seaweed has been freshly exposed. If it\u2019s on the beach, insects are already decomposing it. You can grab handful while out swimming or kayaking. While foraging, it\u2019s a good rule of thumb to not take more than you need, but you can easily air dry seaweed and store it for later use. Virtually all seaweed is edible, though some is more delicious than others. The only toxic salt water seaweed I\u2019m aware of is lyngbya majuscula found in Moreton Bay, Australia.", "title": "How to Wildcraft Nori, Wakame and Other Seaweed", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Harvest-Seaweed/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "1. Stay away from areas that are heavily populated or have industrial or intensive agriculture runoff nearby.\n2. Collect seaweed when the tide is low. Once it\u2019s dry on the beach, insects may be breaking it down, so collect in the water, just below the tide line. Avoid any that look like something has been chewing on them.\n3. Don\u2019t yank seaweed from the rock it\u2019s anchored to. Take scissors and snip, or tear a few leaves from a plant. Never take more than 1/3 from each plant so it can grow back.\n4. Be careful when walking around rocks. Waves can splash through and knock you over, you can slip, and you can step on fragile tide pool creatures and kill them. So step lightly and be careful!\n5. You may need a fishing license or permit to harvest seaweed. Check your state laws.\n6. You can use your seaweed right away. To do this, rinse it under fresh water to remove critters, sand, and excess salt. To keep a saltier flavor, rinse it in ocean water. Seaweed can also be dried-hang it from a clothing line outside, or drape it on a pasta rack in your house. After it\u2019s dried all the way through-usually takes a day or so, store in a brown paper bag in a cool, dry place.

It's quite fun!\nFor real stem ginger you need absolutely fresh ginger roots. As far as I know, these are very hard to get. So you can solve this by buying regular ginger and cutting it in thin slices instead of the usual balls. Cut perpendicular to the grain to make them easier to eat.\nThere are several recipes on the web, here's what I did:\nTake roughly equal parts of ginger root and (palm) sugar.\nPeel the ginger root. (With a spoon. Yes, really! It works and you have hardly any waste.)\nCut into thin slices. (As thin as you can/want.)\nJust cover them in boiling water and keep boiling them until soft, about 45 minutes. You may have to add (hot) water several times.\nAdd the sugar.\nStir regularly to prevent the ginger/sugar from catching and burning.\nOnce the ginger is nice and dark and the liquid has reduced by at least half, remove the ginger slices.\nPut the pot back on a low fire to reduce the liquid to a sirup. Keep stirring and pay close attention.\nAdd the sirup to your slices.\nSome points:\nYou remove the slices in the end so you have better control over the liquid. And if you ruin it, you still have your awesome ginger. ;)\nAny sugar is fine to use, I chose palm sugar this time because I hope it adds another subtle flavour to the balance.\nMaking stem ginger isn't something quickly done.

Really it depends on what size cookies you use.)\nMarshmallows + Powdered Sugar = Marshmallow Fondant (I made a batch with a whole bag of mini marshmallows and that was too much for the amount I did. I only needed half.) Also, I used white because I wanted these to be wedding cakes, but go crazy and try different colors and flavors. Why not make Jello Marshmallow Fondant or Chocolate Marshmallow Fondant!\nIf you don't want to use fondant, you can always use Royal Icing or really whatever icing you want. I tried this originally and if you want to use this you will probably need to frost the cookies and let them sit until they have hardened completely. I tried to stick them together after frosting them and the cookies just slid off each other and made a mess. That is why I switched to fondant.\nDecorating Ingredients:\nSprinkles of Choice: I used white Sugar Pearls (because they looked fancy) and clear/white sugar crystals\nCorn Syrup or something to stick the fondant to the cookies and the sprinkles to the fondant\nSupplies:\nBaking Sheets\nNonstick or Silpat Mats (good for baking cookies and for kneading and cutting out the marshmallow fondant on, it really is a lifesaver with the fondant)\nMixing Bowls\nRolling Pin\nDecorating Paintbrush\nCookie Cutters (I used the three smallest from this set)\nCooling Rack\nOptional: Clear Plastic Containers for people to take these as favors\nSo, I made the cookie dough ahead of time so it could sit in the fridge (as Scoochmaroo suggests) and it is also good to make the marshmallow fondant ahead of time so it can sit. Depending on how many you need to make, it is good to make the cookie dough and marshmallow fondant the day before. Then you can make the cookies the morning you need them and decorate them after they have cooled.\nIt really helps to have help.

Whatever you are going to use, spread a bit of it on the cookies and then you will be ready to cover them in fondant. I find it best to just cover all the cookies in the fondant and then we'll assemble the cookies.\nYou can cut out a bunch of circles and just lay them there, or you can try to cut them out with the cookie cutter and then get them to stick in the cookie cutter. This makes it much easier transferring them to the cookies while also getting them to keep their nice shape and thickness. If you cut it out and then pick it up to put on the cookie, it is going to get at least a little smushed.\nIf your cookies got significantly bigger when baked, just go up a size in cutter for each cookie to cut out the fondant. Mine only got the slightest big wider, so I carefully placed them directly on the center of the cookies and then use my fingers to urge it to spread out to the edges of the cookie.\nAssemble Cakes:\nOkay, time to put them together. First, take two of the large cookies and see which one is bigger (they probably won't be the same size, one will be slightly bigger than the other). Put the bigger one down on the plate and take the other one and take whatever you are using as your \"glue\" and put it on the bottom of that cookie. I found putting it on the bottom of the cookie rather than the top of the fondant was just easier and you are less likely to put your \"glue\" where you don't want it.\nYou can do whatever you want for your cake shape, but I did two of each large, medium and small cookies. I didn't end up with even amounts (because it was easier to use up the rest of the sugar cookie dough by cutting out the medium and small cookies) so some cookie cakes are only 4 layers with just small and medium cookies.

Then, put your cookie on a plate and just sprinkle on the cookies.

In that case, be careful to only put your \"glue\" where you need it. For the pearls I lucked out and they fit perfectly on the lower layers, so I just coated those bottom two exposed fondant layers with the corn syrup and then for the top I just put it along the edge of the fondant.

After a little tweaking, here's the combination I used.  It worked like a charm:\n\nCaramel Magic Shell  \n\n3/4 cup Caramel Baking Chips (135 grams) \n4 scant Tablespoons Coconut Oil (50 grams)\n1/4- 1/2 teaspoon Sea Salt (to taste)\n\nIn a small saucepan, begin melting the coconut oil over very low heat.  Add the caramel chips and stir constantly until the chips are melted and the sauce is smooth. Add 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt, stir well and give the caramel a taste. Add more salt as desired.\n\nRemove the caramel sauce from the heat and use a spoon to drizzle the popsicles over a sheet of parchment paper. \n\nAfter making a mess, I found it was easier to pour the caramel sauce into a squeeze bottle so I could drizzle the popsicles with more control and less waste. The sauce hardens as it cools to room temperature, so I kept a glass hot water handy, too.\n\nMore garnish: Immediately after generously drizzling on the caramel magic shell, generously scatter the oat nuggets on before the sauce hardens.\n\nAs each Pop is finished, return it to the freezer until dessert time. \n\nTo store and serve upright as pictured: Squeeze an ample circle of Caramel Sauce onto a frozen dessert plate and immediately place the popsicle upside down on top of it. Hold the popsicle in place for about 10-15 seconds then move the plate quickly and carefully back into the freezer.\n\nThese pops tend to get soft fairly quick, so only remove then from the freezer a few minutes before serving.\n\nIf you're making these a day or more in advance, gently wrap each popsicle in plastic wrap and keep frozen. They'll keep well 2-3 weeks and possibly longer. \n\nBTW... If you enjoyed this popsicle creation, you'll be happy to hear I have a few more new recipes under development.

Our neighbours, two doors from us, placed a fridge/freezer combination on the curb for rubbish collection a few months ago, and yes, the stingy bastard I am, thought I could fix this and resell it or use it myself. I had a fifty fifty chance of fixing the fridge, either the thermostat was busted (easy and cheap to fix), or the compressor was busted (too expensive to fix). Well as it turned out, it was the compressor.\nSo now I was stuck with a piece of rubbish a few weeks before we move. My wife was fuming because we had no means of disposing of it and I was too proud to put it back on the curb for rubbish collection. (I wanted my neighbours to think I fixed it! LOL) After a few days of deeeeeep thought, I came up with the idea of a food dehydrator. Yes, I saw a few of these conversions on the internet before and thought, well, I do have a food dehydrator, but it was small, now I have the chance of building a nice big one with loads of space for a lot of food to process!!!\nNow, as a South African, we love Biltong (almost like Jerky but differently prepared) and Dro\u00ebwors (dried sausage).

Also, living in Australia, it is difficult to get hold of Biltong and Dro\u00ebwors and, IT IS BLOODY EXPENSIVE going at $60 a kilo!!!!

I had heard about this this East- -meets-tinned-meat staple known as masubi. It seemed like the safest choice of the light bulb- cooked buffet. It had a sweet teriyaki sauce that balanced out the salt, and despite my biases, I enjoyed it. SPAM utilizes pork trim that normally goes to waste, so it was an early adaptor in our growing awareness about food waste. I set out to make my own SPAM, with less salt, but still using parts of the animal that are normally wasted. So I made one out of pig trotters, and a salmon SPAM from collars, bellies and tails.", "title": "Homemade SPAM With Kombu Misubi", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-SPAM/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "This is not as easy as one might think.

Hice una b\u00fasqueda en wikipedia y descubr\u00ed que es una comida alemana bastante t\u00edpica. El spaghettieis fue inventada in 1969 por el hijo de un migrante italiano que ten\u00eda una helader\u00eda en el sur de Alemania. El inventor se llamaba Dario Fontanella y a \u00e9l se le ocurri\u00f3 pasar el helado a trav\u00e9s de un 'Sp\u00e4tzlepresse' para convertirlo en tubos largos. (El 'Sp\u00e4tzlepresse' es un aparato de cocina que se suele usar por preparar 'Sp\u00e4tzle'--se parece a una prensa de patatas.)\nDario Fontanella no patent\u00f3 su creaci\u00f3n y fue difundi\u00e9ndose por toda Alemania. En Alemania, el Spaghettieis es una comida com\u00fan f\u00e1cil de encontrar en el supermercado y disponible en casi cualquier helader\u00eda. Y por supuesto, es especialmente popular con los ni\u00f1os.\nMe encanta la historia detr\u00e1s de esta comida.

Really easy to prepare, also by children. In an earlier Instructable an apple corer was used to prepare Watermelon Sticks (CC BY Openproducts, 28 August 2013).\nBest results are obtained when applying two apple corers of slightly different diameters: when using only a single apple corer the inner cylinders fit too loosely into the outer rings. The widest apple corer should be used for the filling (the resulting cylinder diameter will correspond to the inside measure of the apple corer), the narrowest should be used for the outer rounds (the hole diameter will correspond to the outside measure of the apple corer). Doing so the tight tolerance will result in a firm snack.\nIn this example a cucumber was filled with goat cheese, but alternative combinations will work out fine as well. In Step 1 cucumber is filled with watermelon.\nIn any case, make sure to use all cut-off food in a different dish, for example in a salad. Apropos food waste: in the city of Rotterdam an excellent initiative has been launched to ban food spoiling: Kromkommer (website in Dutch only, freely translated as 'curvedcumber').

When I was young my dad took me on a 4-hour trip to Cinci to eat there, and now there's one in Columbus which is still 90 miles away, but always worth the drive.\nWhen we can't get there I strive to recreate that deliciousness at home, fall-off-the-bone tender ribs, with a touch of smoky flavor, perfect amount of char on the outside, but still juicy inside, and their sauces are excellent too.\nI've barbecued ribs, oven baked them, even boiled them (please do NOT boil ribs, you put all their flavor in the water), my pressure cooker is the only method that's given us a near perfect rib at home in the fastest amount of time. The ribs cook in their own sauce, keeping as much flavor in the rib as possible, then we finish them on the grill to let the sugars in the sauce caramelize and create a wonderful char and crispy skin.\nAll that flavor in less than 90 minutes? I'm in! I based this recipe off America's Test Kitchen's book Pressure Cooker Perfection: 100 Foolproof Recipes that will Change the Way You Cook. I love their method of cooking their pulled pork (https://www.instructables.com/id/Pressure-Cooker-Pulled-Pork/), and these ribs in their own sauce, not only does the meat retain excellent flavor, but you reduce the sauce for serving, and that creates a thick, meaty, full-bodied, sweet, tangy sauce. I've made a few changes that suit my family's tastes and what works best in my pressure cooker.\nPer the usual with my other pressure cooker recipes posted, I simply can't say enough about them. My Cuisinart 6-quart continues to turn out the most succulent food, and you can make delicious meals on any weeknight, no need to save those yummy ribs for Sunday dinner. If you are having a weekend barbecue you can pressure cook a couple batches of racks ahead of time, then finish on the grill to serve, your guests will think you've been tending to a smoker all night long!\nAll these ribs need are some baked beans, cole slaw, and sliced watermelon for the perfect summer meal.

The silverskin is slightly shiny/glossy, almost translucent, we find the ribs turn out much more tender when it's removed. The easiest way we've found is if you can get a butter knife, or dull side of paring knife, under it to pull up enough that you can grab with your fingers, then ease it off the full length of the ribs, sometimes it breaks and you need to restart, sometimes the stars align and it peels right off, discard.\nOnce you've removed the silverskin cut the ribs into three sections and dry each as well as you can with paper towels.\nMix the spice rub ingredients you're using together in a small bowl.\nRub half the spice rub on one side of the ribs, half the spice rub on the other side, massaging into the meat as you apply it. (I like to do this on paper towels so if excess falls off I can add it to a Ziploc bag with the ribs so as much gets used as possible.)\nAt this point you can move forward with the recipe, leaving the ribs at room temperature while you prepare the sauce, or transfer the ribs to a Ziploc bag, seal, and let them sit in the refrigerator overnight (I always let them sit overnight, we like well-seasoned ribs.)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHP/2YU3/HXGUOH0Q/FHP2YU3HXGUOH0Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7I/9SWQ/HXGUOH0V/F7I9SWQHXGUOH0V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG6/LEQH/HXGUOH0W/FG6LEQHHXGUOH0W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F04/SCA0/HXGUOH0Z/F04SCA0HXGUOH0Z.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Prepare the Ribs"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "In a 2-cup measuring cup, or bowl, stir in ketchup, water, molasses, vinegar, mustard, and liquid smoke, if using, to combine.\nHeat oil in pressure cooker pot over medium heat until shimmering.

Arrange ribs upright in pot with meaty sides facing outward, then pour reserved sauce over ribs.\nI consulted quite a few pressure cooked ribs recipes for their cooking times, and they all vary wildly. ATK recommends a 30-minute cook time, some call for as little as 10 minutes. We definitely like fall apart tender ribs, but I opted to cook for 18 minutes, leaving myself room before dinner to allow for extra cooking time if need be. You can always re-pressurize and cook longer, but you can't fix overcooked. This, of course, all depends on the amount and size of your ribs, had I been doing 2 meaty racks of ribs, I probably would cook them 22-25 minutes on high pressure.\nLock pressure cooker lid in place and bring to high pressure over medium-high heat. As soon as pot reaches high pressure, reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 18 minutes, adjusting heat as needed to maintain high pressure. If using electric pressure cooker, cook on high pressure for 18 minutes. Allow the pressure to release naturally for 15 minutes. (Don't let electric pressure cooker switch to keep warm, turn cooker off for the natural release.)\nMake sure your ribs are tender, they'll have shrunk from the bone, and may even be falling off the bone.

Some potatoes may cook faster than others, remove cooked ones from microwave and continue cooking until all the sweet potatoes are cooked.\nLet rest 10 minutes.\nTo crisp the skins you have another grill/oven option, I often make these a day ahead, so prep them inside using the oven, and finish them on the grill. If you are cooking same day, and want to use the grill, preheat the grill to 400-425 degrees, set up for INDIRECT grilling (keep primary burner on, and turn off those that you'll cook the sweet potatoes over). Otherwise, preheat your oven to 425 degrees.\nHalve each potato lengthwise, use a spoon (I prefer a melon baller) to scoop the flesh into a ricer, or a food mill (if you intend to hand mash, scoop the potato flesh into a large bowl), leaving 1/4-inch thickness of flesh on the potatoes. Rice the sweet potatoes into a large bowl, you may need to do this in batches, I usually rice 3-4 potato halves at once.\nPlace the shells, cut side up, on a wire rack set inside a baking sheet (I line the baking sheet with foil for easy clean-up.) Bake until shells are dry and slightly crispy, 10-15 minutes. If you intend to eat the shells, and have extra bacon grease around (like any good Midwestern family should!), rubbing the outside of the shells with some bacon grease prior to baking/grilling will only improve them!\nWhile the shells bake, mash the sweet potatoes with the melted butter, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, egg, and 1/2 tsp. salt until smooth.\nRemove the shells from oven.

Top each filled shell with the bread mixture, I try to push some into the sweet potato filling so it stays in place. At this point you can let cool, then cover, and refrigerate up to 24 hours.

Rich, comforting flavors that are uniquely contrasted by the tart and refreshing layer of raspberry compote. Garnished with chantilly cream, mint leaves and strawberries, this dessert pairs well with a robust, black cup of coffee.\nAbout the Rhapsody Tart\nThe Rhapsody Tart is an old and esoteric recipe. As far as I know, this dessert is one of a kind and I don't believe this dessert exists anywhere else. There may have been a time when the Rhapsody Tart was known but I haven't seen or heard of it anywhere, on the internet or other places.\nThe reason why I have this recipe is from a chance encounter which makes for a somewhat interesting story.\nThe story behind the Rhapsody Tart\nDark red brick walls, a white balcony and three stories high, a \"restaurant\" was a modest name to call it. That restaurant behemoth however, was older than my great grandparents; with walls that held so many stories that Poe would be jealous. A naive teenager at the time, I eagerly earned my first job there as the low life dishwasher.\nTwo years flew by; and I couldn't stop peeking behind the shadows of those great chefs. Every Tuesday afternoon, the Sous Chef would be making the final additions to the demi-glace, the Garde Manger prepared his fresh charcuterie and chicken pate, and the Pastry Chef would be hand dipping his ganache truffles. As an impressionable adolescent that had an infinite appetite, this restaurant could make heaven seem bitter.\nI was finally allowed to help prep the pastries, and when the Pastry Chef quit: I gradually took his place.\nAfter I finally established myself as competent; a server approached me during the tea time.\n\"There's a group of elderly women here, they're asking me about the Rhapsody Tart dessert we have.\"\nI never heard of such a dessert. \"I don't even know what that is, when did they have it?\"\n\"They were mentioning that the last time they came here was 30 years ago.\"\n\"Sorry,\" I replied. \"They're mistaken.\"\nAnd 1 minute later, the name: Rhapsody Tart left my mind and I didn't think about that dessert for 3 months.\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\"Could you go check the attic?\" The head chef asked me. It was a slow Thursday morning, and the chefs were preparing food for the weekend rush. \"We need more plates and there's extra in the attic.\"\nI quickly went up two floors to the attic above and grabbed a crate of plates, and began my trek to the kitchen.\nNow, let me take this moment to describe the inside of this restaurant. The restaurant decor is very old fashioned Victorian with an insane amount of objects hanging on the walls: picture frames, book shelves, ornate stained wood working, and mounted taxidermy.\nI was walking down the stairs when I stopped suddenly. Setting the plates on the floor I took a few steps back. On the wall there, hung a rustic wooden frame containing a light brown piece of paper. Approaching it, I saw that it was an old magazine article, however there was a title in this page that caught my eye.\nI picked the frame up from the wall. Ah, there's that title: \"The Rhapsody Tart\"; the title of this article was \"The Rhapsody Tart\". I started reading:\n\"8 eggs; 5 cups of brown sugar....\" It's a recipe! But there was more to the article: a woman sent a letter to the magazine, explaining that the restaurant I worked at made a fantastic dessert called: \"The Rhapsody Tart\", but the stubborn pastry chef at the time would not reveal the recipe to the dessert for the woman. The woman went on hoping that the magazine could make a request to the pastry chef, and essentially glorify him for his dessert to publish the recipe. Apparently this was tempting enough and the recipe was shared, and here it is: the Rhapsody Tart!\nWhen was this written? I checked the bottom of the page: \"April 1972\".\nI took that frame and the crate of plates and rushed down to the kitchen. My eyes darted across the page.\n\"1st stage: 3 tbs sugar and 11 tbs butter....\"\nI got to work right away: I grabbed a large bag of raw walnuts, roasted them and processed them in the Cuisinart. The walnut crust was made, baked into a shallow quiche pan.\nNow for the filling: eggs, brown sugar, coconut, walnuts, flour and salt. While that was baking I made the compote from raspberries we got from the market yesterday. The compote was spread onto the baked pastry and allowed to cool.\nTemptation was mercilessly murdering my self control: okay, okay, fine! One bite.\nAt that moment, my dessert tray was impacted for the rest of my pastry chef career. I never had a staple dessert on my tray, but every week: the Rhapsody Tart was served. I loved that dessert, and it is still my favorite dessert to this day.\nWhy is this dessert being shared\nI haven't worked at that restaurant for a few years, but I recorded the Rhapsody Tart recipe for myself and made it again and again just for family and friends. That recipe has still remained something of a secret, but I decided to finally share it with the Instructable's community. Until now, I was keeping the recipe to myself out of respect for the restaurant I worked at as they continued to make it. Later I realized that the restaurant had acquired the services of a local pastry shop and are no longer serving the Rhapsody Tart.\nThis dessert is far too good to be wiped off the face of the Earth so I feel it needs to be shared.", "title": "The Rhapsody Tart", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Rhapsody-Tart/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Ingredients\nSee the ingredient list below.

For this recipe, I recommend purchasing the raw walnuts.\nTake all your raw walnuts that you'll be using and lay them out flat on a sheet tray. Preset your oven to 375F and start roasting the walnuts when the oven is heated. The walnuts will be ready when they begin to brown and you can smell their toastiness. This takes roughly 5 to 8 minutes.\nTake 3.75 ounces (1.5 cups) of the walnuts and grind them in a food processor.

This forms something like a thin ring around the pan that slightly goes over.\nBake the crust for approximately 10 minutes at 375F. You may err on the side of less time.\nPost-Baking\nNow that the crust is finished, allow it to cool for half an hour. You could spend this time making the filling.

If the compote is cooled but does not seem thick enough, you can heat it again to remove more of the water. The compote should be thin enough to easily spread, but thick enough to hold its place: like soft butter.\nSeasoning the compote\nThe compote is very important because it takes the powerful sweetness of the tart itself and adds a whole new dimension to the dessert. The compote should be somewhat sweet, but also tart. There should also be a touch of saltiness to the compote.\nYou will need to add lemon juice, lemon zest and salt to your taste. Without these three ingredients, the compote will just have a one dimensional sweetness to it and will be boring. Be somewhat liberal with the lemon juice and salt when seasoning. You should add enough lemon juice to the point to cut the sweetness a bit and introduce a tartness to the compote.

The are perfect for children as they are a fun small version of a normal meal, and some less mature adults might also find them entertaining! The only real draw back of this recipe is that unless you can find a supermarket that sells miniature burger buns (unlikely!) you have to make them yourself, which can be a bit time consuming.\nRemember the 4 Canape attributes:\nSalty\nSmall\nCircular\nFour parts\nStill interested ?\nThe next stage of the recipe deals with making the miniature burger buns. If you have by some miracle managed to find some the just go straight on to step 2.", "title": "Cheese Burger Canapes", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Cheese-Burger-Canapes/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Ingredients:\n20ml of milk\n75ml warm water\n20g butter (unsalted)\n210g flour\n7g yeast\n20g sugar\npinch of salt\n1 egg\n1 egg beaten with water for egg wash\nsesame seeds\nI have decided to break this recipe down in to 4 easy steps.\n1. Mix the ingredients\n2. Knead the Dough\n3. Allow to rise\n4. Bake\nStep 1 Mix the ingredients\nMix all of the Dried Ingredients in a large bowl. Once roughly mixed add the wet ingredients. The water acts as a binding agent, so with that in mind add as much water as you feel you need. You only need your dough to come together in to a ball, and you don't want your dough to be too wet (there are few things that I find more difficult to work with then wet dough)!\nStep 2 Knead the Dough\nSo this is the stage where you will end up building some muscle in you arms! You really need to work this dough until it feels soft,smooth and elastic to the touch. By the time you have finished kneading, all the extra flour on your work surface and in the bowl should be incorporated in to the dough. I like to use extra flour when i'm kneading; not only does this stop it from sticking to surfaces but the dough also tends to feel wetter when you knead it, so you need extra flour to get it to the right texture.\nStep 3 Allow to rise\nBy this point you should have a nice firm and soft dough. As this recipe makes 24 miniature burger buns you should start to split your dough up in to 24 little balls. Once you have separated them all off you need to place them on baking paper and press sesame seeds on to the top. After this leave them to rise for an hour in a warm location.\nStep 4 Bake\nSo this is the final step of the process, pre-heat the oven to 200\u00b0C 400\u00b0F Gas Mark 6. You need to drizzle on top your egg wash mixture (1 egg Beaten mixed with a couple tablespoons of water), this will give your buns a lovely shine when they come out of the oven.

Toast the burger Buns\n2. Prepare Burger patties\n3. Cook Burgers\n4. Arrange Burgers\nStep 1 Toast the Burger Buns\nI have Chosen to do this by shallow frying them for about a minute in some oil, but if you think that you can fit them in your toaster then by all means do use that. I would however not recommend the use of the oven or the grill as this will leave them very dry and crunchy.\nStep 2 Prepare the Burger Patties\nThe mince beef that you have should be enough to make around 20 miniature burger patties. The mince only needs a sprinkle of salt and pepper before its ready to go in the burger mix. The easiest way to make the patties is to divide the meat into 20 sections, get a lump, roll it in to a small ball and then flatten it. Then it's a simple matter of tidying up the sides a little bit and putting it in the hot frying pan\nStep 3 Cook the Burger Patties\nIn a hot oiled pan add your burger patties. They need about 4 minutes on each side on a medium heat, but to be on the safe side always cut one in half first to check it's cooked through before you eat it. Burgers should only be turned over once otherwise you risk breaking them. Once you have cooked the first side and turned it over, its time to add the cheese. you should cut the cheese slices in to 4 pieces and place them on top of the burger patties whilst still in the pan - this lets them melt all over the burger covering it. Once cooked, turn off the heat and set aside\nStep 4. Arranging the Burgers\nLay out all of your ingredients around a board for easy access whilst you are working. Start off by Laying your cut burger buns out and next to each other. Next you will need to add a small amount of ketchup and Mustard to the Top Half. Then add your minced onions and your gherkin slices. Finally add your cheese burger, cheese side down on top off all of the condiments, season for the final time with salt and pepper and then flip the entire thing on to the bottom slice. Serve immediately, as the burger buns will not last very long once they have been cut in half.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCI/GGU8/HXA9J0VM/FCIGGU8HXA9J0VM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Cheese Burger Canapes"}], "channel": "BBQ & Grilling"}, {"category": "Food", "description": "About 15 years ago I learned about grilled peaches from my friend, Linda, who does amazing catering in the high desert of the eastern Sierras.

Try to keep your material thin so it won't get stuck in the vacuum formed mold but thick enough that your chocolate won't break when you take it out of the mold.\nOnce your parts are cut out and collected from the laser cutter glue the molecules onto the bases. Try to keep them as centered as possible. I used a plastic glue, some options include plastic weld and epoxy.\nAfter the parts have cured completely add draft angles onto the bases by sanding down the edges to about a 45 degree angle. This will help in releasing your part from the vacuum form mold.\nThe final step to preparing your originals for molding is adding air vents to the interior details. The vacuum form machine works by pulling heated plastic onto the part through vacuum suction in the bed.

Everyone makes his own, which is good! I've just followed some advices from friends and family and add other ingredients to make my version.\nCappuccino is one the classic Italian coffees, and one of the most appreciated. Its popularity is due to its sweet flavor and full-bodied taste, less strong than a regular Espresso. An easy-to-drink one!\nBut, the thruth is that Cappuccino always has a full serving of Espresso inside, which is only lightened but some milk and sugar.\nCappuccino is also my favorite kind of coffee. While Latte Macchiato (milk \"spotted\" with some drops of coffee) is too light for me, in Cappuccino you can still feel the aroma of a good, strong Italian coffee.\nThis dessert version also involves ice-cream, cream (sometime used in regular coffee, but not so often) and sweet yogurt.\nIt's a great dessert for these hot, summer evenings.\nBut promise me that you won't overdo with this tastiness!

Just look at the honeycomb structure, we have to scratch our heads even if we want to copy it!\nIn this step, the yummy fruits are transformed into the mysterious honeycomb gels, and your guests are going to say ' How did you make that?'\nThe selection of fruit you use is totally up to you. Choose what\u2019s in season and tasting great! We used cherry, blueberry, nectarine, honeydew, and strawberry. You may see some variation in the gelling depending on the fruit. This may take some trial and error but in general the process is the same. Be that artist you always wanted to be! The variety of colors and flavors is the beauty in this dish. Here is what you will need for each variety of fruit:\n\u00bd Cup Fresh Fruit in cut in small pieces\n1 Packet of Gelatin (1/4 oz packet) (for high water fruit like melon use 1 \u00bd packets)\n1 Tbsp Honey\n1 Tbsp Lemon Juice\nYou will also need to have the following ready to go:\n1 Baking tray lined with bubble wrap that has been washed and dried\n*Size depends on variety of fruit. We found that 1 9\u201dx13\u201d sheet was good for 4 fruits\nPlace the fruit in the blender with the lemon juice and blend to a smooth puree. Pour into small stainless steel bowl and sprinkle in gelatin while stirring to prevent lumps. Let the fruit puree sit for 5 minutes so the gelatin can bloom or hydrate. During this time you can begin to prepare the next fruit. If you start with the light colored fruit and work to the darker colors, you don\u2019t have to be so careful about washing the blender.\nPlace the bowl of puree over a double boiler and stir until the fruit feels warm to the touch. The purpose is to melt the gelatin. The puree will have thickened up a bit from the gelatin. Once the gelatin is melted, the puree should resemble its original consistency. There should be no lumps or grains of gelatin. Add the honey and pour the puree onto a section of the bubble wrap. Start in one corner of the pan and let the puree flow naturally. For very wet fruit you may see some leaching of juice. This happened to our honeydew puree! No problem, just use a smaller separate pan for this fruit so you contain the liquid.\nRepeat this with the remaining fruits.

Many would call him the pioneer of what is most commonly referred to as molecular gastronomy. Spherificaton is a whimsical technique that is used to create an element of surprise in the dining experience that is also delicious. Simply explained, when a mixture containing calcium comes in contact with a mixture containing alginate or vice versa, a reaction takes place that forms a gel. When the calcium containing liquid is the one being gelled, the process is referred to as reverse spherification. There is a lot of information and videos on spherication on the internet. Here is one that explains the process we will use, http://www.molecularrecipes.com/spherification/re...\nThis recipe for yogurt spheres was adapted from a recipe found in the book Made in Spain by Chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s.\nAlginate Solution\nFor the yogurt spheres you will need to prepare the following at least 2 hours in advance to let the air bubbles dissipate. Bubbles can inhibit gelling. Alginate is an extract of seaweed with cold and hot gelling properties. It is readily available from many internet stores\n4 Cups of Filtered Water (calcium in unfiltered water can cause the alginate to gel)\n2 Tsp Sodium Alginate\nPlace water and alginate in a blender and blend on medium speed for one minute so the alginate is completely dissolved. Pour mixture into a dish that is about 4 inches deep and ideally just big enough so the liquid is about 1 inch from the top edge. Place in the refrigerator to rest.\nHoney Yogurt\n1 Cup Plain Full Fat Yogurt\n2 Tbsp Honey\n\u00bc Cup Whole Milk or Filtered Water\nUsing a spoon or whisk mix all of the ingredients until well blended. It is easier to fully blend in the honey if it is slightly warm and liquefied. This can easily be done by warming it in the microwave for just a few seconds or over a double boiler. This mixture can be made ahead and stored in the refrigerator until ready to use or used immediately. The spheres can be made in advance but we found it best to make them at the time of service because they can be fragile.\nMaking the Spheres\nRemove the alginate solution from the refrigerator. Prepare a second container of equal size with filtered water. You will need a slotted spoon or fine mesh skimmer, a teaspoon measure, and a plate to hold the completed spheres. If the slots in the spoon are too large the sphere will hang through and potentially tear so smaller holes are better.\nScoop the yogurt mixture into the teaspoon and drain off any excess by pulling the bottom along the edge of the dish. In a single, fluid motion drop the yogurt into the alginate mixture. The spoon should just break the surface of the liquid. Doing this too slowly with result in the spheres having tails instead of being round. This takes some practice so don\u2019t be discourage if they aren\u2019t perfect! In the beginning it is easier to do one sphere at a time but it is possible to create multiple spheres in the same container. Just be careful to avoid having the spheres touch each other or they will stick and then break when you try to separate them.\nAfter dropping the sphere or spheres into the alginate, gently swirl the liquid with a spoon to be sure the spheres are not touching and the skin forms over the entire surface. The skin will continue to get stronger as the calcium and alginate are in contact. We found 3-4 minutes worked well for us. This allowed a skin to form that was strong enough but not too thick. The viscosity of the brand of yogurt you use may favor a thicker skin for a looser consistency or thinner for thicker. After the spheres are set, carefully remove them using the slotted spoon or mesh and transfer them to the plain water to rinse off the alginate. This will halt the skin from continuing to get thicker. The goal is a thin membrane that encompasses the liquid yogurt but is not too gelled. After about a 30 second rinse, carefully transfer the yogurt spheres to a plate to hold them until the remaining yogurt has been spherified. Be careful, if they sit too long and touch they may stick to each other.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXN/80A6/HX1W9YAI/FXN80A6HX1W9YAI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTY/H79Y/HX1W9LFF/FTYH79YHX1W9LFF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF4/ZDBB/HX1W9LFE/FF4ZDBBHX1W9LFE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQR/OA6L/HX1W9LHL/FQROA6LHX1W9LHL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9V/VEPT/HX1W9LHM/F9VVEPTHX1W9LHM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKG/P633/HX1W9LJU/FKGP633HX1W9LJU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Spherified Honey Yogurt"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Now it\u2019s time to just be creative and play!

This is crucial otherwise you could contaminate the mead and grow nasties.\nAdd the honey(see next page), the lemon juice or citric acid (see page after next), 1/4 teaspoon pectic enzyme, 1 teaspoon of yeast nutrient, the tea or tannin into the demijohn. Add water up to where the demijohn starts to narrow/get rounded, don't fill up higher than this or when fermentation starts the froth may overflow. See the 2nd and 3rd pictures, in the 3rd picture the one on the left is a little above where I'd fill up to. Sprinkle the yeast on top, I used a sachet of Wilko general wine yeast. Add the airlock and wait a couple of days till the bubbling settles, then top up/top off with water to the to bottom of the neck/narrow bit of the demijohn (just below the handles-as the one on the right in picture 3, or picture 4).\nThe fermentation should settle in a couple of weeks, this can be seen by air bubbles stopping coming out of the airlock. Leave the mead a couple of weeks, till the sediment starts to sink to the bottom and it looks clear.\nIdeally you should siphon (or rack) the mead to another demijohn (or into something temporarily, then back into the same demijohn after washing out), leaving as much of the sediment behind as possible.\nAfter this you can leave the mead a few weeks more to clear entirely, if sediment forms at the bottom, you can siphon to another container again, till no more sediment forms. You can use finings to speed up the process, but you want to age the mead anyway, so waiting to clear naturally isn't so bad.\nAfter you happy its cleared, add 1 crushed campden tablet and the fermentation stopper as per its directions, which usually says leave for 3 days. If your happy to leave the mead dry or add more honey to sweeten, then bottle. You can use bottles with corks, caps or screw tops, even plastic screw top bottles, just make sure to sterilise them first.\nLeave the mead for a few months ideally a year or two, it will improve over this time.\nHere are a couple more recipes also, credit to creators:\nJoe's Grape Mead\nJoe's ancient orange mead\nJack Keller Mead (Mr Keller really knows his stuff)\nNow onto the science!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FB5/5RPZ/HX0DKEOP/FB55RPZHX0DKEOP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE8/Q0I6/HX0DKEPY/FE8Q0I6HX0DKEPY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYE/RLQS/HX6YDKZV/FYERLQSHX6YDKZV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1S/D5PB/HX0DKEQ2/F1SD5PBHX0DKEQ2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO4/P0W8/HX0DKEVF/FO4P0W8HX0DKEVF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F58/9SN9/HX0DKEQY/F589SN9HX0DKEQY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Getting Started"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "People often talk about making sweeter mead by adding more honey, but the yeast would convert all the sugar into alcohol, unless you added so much honey that the yeast died of alcohol poisoning (ie at 16-19% abv) and couldn't convert the remaining sugar to alcohol. I feel its better to pick an abv (alcohol by volume) add enough sugar to achieve this, let if ferment, stabilise, then add sugar or honey at the end to sweeten to taste.\nHow much honey? well this depends of the abv (%alcohol) you want to achieve, you can use a hydrometer to help work this out. But the above chart tells you how much honey approximately per gallon (4.5l, UK gallon) will achieve the abv. This assuming the honey is around 76g of sugar per 100g honey. But remember there will be additional sugar if you add fruit or juice.\nIn context, beer and cider are generally 4-5% abv, wine 11-13% abv.\nSo typically most recipes will go for 2 or 3lbs, for simplicity (most honey is sold in 1lb or 454g jars). You could make weaker mead, but it probably would keep as well, the higher alcohol percentage helps prevent bacterial growth.\nSo on to acidity...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWB/MN6R/HX0DLIGE/FWBMN6RHX0DLIGE.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Honey and How Much?"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Acid is key in wine as it gives the wine body, it also affects the tannins, which give red wine their distinctive character. In Mead acidity is less of an issue in terms of taste (although some people will disagree), some recipes omit additional acid entirely. Although in melomels (mead with fruit) extra acid is supplied by the fruit.\nThe acidity dose still have an important role, if the must (the honey and water mixture) is too acidotic (low pH) then the yeasts, enzymes will denature (break down or change their shape, is your GCSE/high school biology and chemistry coming back to you?), so they won't work and won't produce any alcohol. If there isn't enough acid (high pH), then there is a risk of bacterial contaminates growing and spoiling the mead (they don't tent to grow well at lower pH). At very low levels of acid (high pH) the enzymes may also denature, but unless you add alkalising agents it is unlikely to occur.\nIn wine it is generally though the ideal pH (in terms of flavour, preservation) is around 3.5. I try to achieve this with mead. Most recipes will (hopefully) be balanced in their acidity and aim for around this.\nIn the prior recipe I used 2 lemons, which is approximately the equivalent of 2 teaspoons of citric acid. Although the acidity and size of the lemons can vary.\nIf your making your own recipe its could be useful to check the acidity, the most accurate way to do this would be by titration (seeing how much alkali solution it takes to neutralise the pH of the must) and there are kits available for this. I haven't done this as its yet more equipment and following a reliable recipe is usually close enough.\nYou can buy narrow range pH paper, to roughly check:\nhttp://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_odkw=ph+paper+3-5&_osacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313&_nkw=ph+paper+0.5-5&_sacat=0\nIs it getting hot in here or are we just going to look at temperature...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNA/QZXO/HX0DMFMH/FNAQZXOHX0DMFMH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Acidity"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Temperature affects the rate of activity of the enzymes of the yeast, too low and fermentation will be very slow.

This shows the greater rate of fermentation at higher temperatures, but unless it's very cold, the yeast will ferment all the sugar to alcohol eventually.

Some people feel using bread yeast isn't a good idea as it can make the mead taste bready. Not being selected for making alcohol, its hard to know how much alcohol the yeast could produce/tolerate before denaturing, so the fermentation could stop prematurely or produce funny tastes.\nI tend to use white wine or champagne yeast for mead.\nWhy do yeast produce alcohol? I hear you ask (ok I know you didn't, but humour me, I'm nearly done).\nLike many organisms yeast utilise sugar to create energy, via aerobic respiration (uses oxygen to break down to release energy). But in the closed fermentation vessel, the oxygen is used up so the yeast utilise fermentation, which doesn't require oxygen (its anaerobic).\nThe picture illustrates the basics of the reaction; the enzymes in the yeast breaking down the sugar to pyruvate then to ethanol (the alcohol we want) and carbon dioxide, which is why gas bubbles out of the demijohn.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMP/H1ZZ/HX1WBT7O/FMPH1ZZHX1WBT7O.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Yeast"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Hope that didn't bring back too many bad (high)school memories.\nThanks for reading, any thoughts let me know, please be kind this is my first Instructable.\nOh yes, and I'm entering the Made By Bees Contest, so I'd be very grateful if you'd vote for me.\nFor further reading on wine making have a look at Jack Keller's wine blog, there's lots of reading\nJack Keller Wine Blog\nOr this book is quite good if your starting making wine\nFirst Steps in Wine Making: C J Berry\nBye for now,\nMark.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIJ/R4QA/HX0DK9QM/FIJR4QAHX0DK9QM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: That's All for Now"}], "channel": "Homebrew"}, {"category": "Food", "description": "Food artistry was once solely the work of chefs stationed behind the burners and ovens of Michelin-rated restaurants in major metropolitan areas.

As consumers, we would bear the brunt of the cost burden.\nThe product of a newly minted upper middle class, foodie culture spawned a new breed of overpriced food. Cafes and restaurants, with their refined menus, had a ripe market of suckers willing to pay through the nose simply to flaunt their newfound knowledge and wealth. Bread, a staple of diets of both the rich and the poor, became toast that would sell for $4 a slice. Salads, essentially greens that one could grow in a backyard, $15. Ice cream, $5 a scoop... after a 20 minute wait in line. What's next? How much are people willing to overpay for the privilege of doing so?\nFor those unfamiliar with pruno, a little history lesson: since time immemorial, alcohol has served as the cause of and solution to all of our problems. A small percentage of people, for one reason or another, have made enough poor decisions that they now spend their days in prison. Does being behind bars keep them from getting drunk? Of course not!

Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F.\n\n2.  In a small bowl, mix all of the ingredients for the crust.  Mix until everything is well combined.\n\n3.  Put the crust into a rectangular glass pyrex baking dish (mine is about 8x11 inches).  Use a spatula to flatter then crust out as much as possible.   Bake for 10 minutes. \n\n4.  While the crust is baking, heat the heavy cream in a small sauce pan over medium heat until it is very warm but no where near boiling.  Stir very frequently to avoid burning.    Add in the butter and salt.  When the butter is melted, remove the pan from heat and pour in the chocolate chips.  Use a whisk to stir vigorously (about 1 minute) until the chocolate is completely melted.  Set aside until the crust is done. \n\n5.  Remove the crust from the oven and, using a clean spatula, flatten it out as much as possible.  The crust puffs up when you bake it, and the goal is to compress it back down so its firm.\n\n6.   Pour the filling mixture over the crust.  Cool uncovered in the fridge for at least 4 hours, or over night.     Sprinkle with sea salt before cutting/serving.

IF YOU LIKE IT, VOTE FOR IT! THANKS :)\nHi everybody, dear friends!\nI\u2019m Filippo from Bologna, Italy.\nAs all of the world know, Italy has the most fantastic, popular and diversified cooking tradition of the planet. The great thing about Italy is that you find a particular cooking style in the center-north part of the country, like pasta, cheese, cold cuts\u2026 then you have to travel only 100km to reach the sea and find completely different meals, based on fish&meat. I think that this is the real \u201cpower\u201d of the beloved Italian cuisine.\nBut, after this patriotic interlude, I have to admit that we are a little poor in BBQ.\nDon\u2019t misunderstand me, we have great raw materials to work with, but, mostly, we lit a fire, put the meat on the grill with some rosemary and that\u2019s all.\nWhen I was a kid, I\u2019ve travelled from Nevada to New York, and I\u2019ve found that, differently from what most of Italians think, American cuisine is incredibly various and interesting, especially about meat and BBQs.\nAmerican BBQ use a lot of sauces, rub and spices that we ignore.\nFor example, paprika: I think that paprika is the PERFECT base for meats\u2019 spicy mixes, but in Italy it\u2019s uncommon. We can find it easily at the supermarket, but it\u2019s not often found in Italian kitchens.\nSo, my aim is to create a Magic Dust Rub for our BBQ, taking inspirations from American style but with the touch of Italy\u2019s tradition! :D\nShopping list!\nMaking the Magic Rub Dust is very simple. We only have to find the best ingredients and mix everything together.\nHere\u2019s the list of what you need:\n- 140gr (5.00oz) of paprika\n- 50gr (1.76oz) of fine salt. I prefer not to add a lot of salt, because salt is not ideal BEFORE cooking. Also, people have a different taste about salt, so I let everyone add it at will after cooking.\n- 20gr (0.71oz) of grinded black pepper. The best choice is to have fresh black pepper to grind at the moment.\n- 3 spoon of whole brown sugar\n- 10-20gr (0.35-0.70oz) of hot pepper. I love spicy foods. Adjust the amount of hot pepper depending on your taste.\n- 40gr (1.40oz) of freeze-dried garlic. The fresh garlic is too \u201cwet\u201d. For better result you can fine-chop fresh garlic and let it dry at direct sunlight.\n- FRESH Rosemary, as much as you want\nYou will also need some basic kitchen tool:\n- a digital scale\n- a bowl\n- a sharp knife and a spoon\nThis are the quantities for a small amount of Magic Rub Dust, that will serve you for 8-9 family BBQs.\nIf you want more, just double the numbers!", "title": "BBQ Magic Rub Dust \u2013 Italian Style", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/BBQ-Magic-Rub-Dust-Italian-Style/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "As I said, I think that paprika is perfect for making meat spicy-mixes!\nSo, it will be the base of our mix.

Italians prefer the raw flavor of the meat, which becomes covered if we use sauces rich in sugar.\nSo, since we are making the dust more Ital-esque, I\u2019m putting only 3 spoon of whole brown sugar.\nIt\u2019s a particular quality that I\u2019ve found in markets.

I\u2019m not joking And another good point is that Rosemary is almost immortal.\nIt survives cold and dryness, and pass winter with ease. I have several plants in my balcony. I remember that one time I forgot about one little plant of rosemary that I had left in the garage during winter (below 0\u00b0c temperatures). For two months it remained without water or sunlight.

When attached to the inside of a tap, you just open the tap and out comes your filtered wort. It works well for filtering out both the spent grains and spent hops too.

I mean this:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubilee_Clip\n5) a flexible plumbing hose (wide diameter type) - these are found in DIY stores and are sold for connecting Bath taps to the water pipes, and the big fat ones are best for this job.

The key is to take your time, make sure you have a comfortable grip, and don't move to quickly you want the metal to heat up enough to bind to the weld.

I managed to get all the welding done in about an hour and a half including a lot of cigarette breaks.\nUsing welding magnets to hold the pieces together I put in a spot weld just to securely hold it, my magnets were cheap and didn't seem very well.

I kept them in the water until I had cut all the other stuff. I'm uncertain what the saltwater does to the eggplant, but many recipes demand treating eggplants with salt or salty water, so I just follow the common herd with this...\nThe mushrooms, onions, artichokes and sweet pepper I cut into manageable bite size (no need to cut cherry tomatoes). When cutting fragile ingredients like mushrooms be careful to cut the pieces big enough. They should be skewer-able without breaking. If you do this for the first time I recommend to assemble a test skewer before you cut up all the vegetables, this way you'll get a feeling for the right size.\nAnd a hint I actually haven't tried myself: If you use wooden skewers and prepare them on a \"real\" grill the wooden skewers tend to burn - soaking them in water beforehand makes them less likely to do so...", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMH/N0A9/HW0FVVYL/FMHN0A9HW0FVVYL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1P/F074/HW0FVWUR/F1PF074HW0FVWUR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Y/P4WU/HW0FVXEL/F8YP4WUHW0FVXEL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F64/DBZJ/HW0FVYWY/F64DBZJHW0FVYWY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJP/ILVR/HW0FW664/FJPILVRHW0FW664.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSW/547X/HW0FVURP/FSW547XHW0FVURP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSA/8MQA/HW0FVZ84/FSA8MQAHW0FVZ84.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6X/A451/HW0FVZMX/F6XA451HW0FVZMX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Preparation"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "There are different ways to skewer the vegetables:\nMy favorite one you can see on the upper left corner of pic 1.\nThese skewers are crammed with bite size vegetables while bands of sliced veggies wind around them.\nThe pictures explain the process better than I could with words, so take a look at them.\nHere are some Tips & Tricks:\nIt's nice use two strips of vegetables at the same time.\nBefore you arrive at the end of one strip just place another strip on on top of it for seamless winding (pic 9)\nThan more vegetables are on the stick than harder it gets to push the skewer further. The best method is to grab the vegetables with one hand and to use the other hand to push the skewer with an rotary motion a little further (pic 12).\nI highly recommend to use two skewers per veggie-stick. You can either start with two or you construct your stick just with one and add the second one afterwards.\nI was short on skewers so I made some with just one, but was super annoyed when I had them on the griddle: As soon the the vegetables cook they get soft and when you try to turn them on the other side you most likely just turn the skewer... Use two skewers!\n.\nOn the upper right you can see lanced strips of veggies, I use about two or three layers of strips to make these. They are a nice snack, but not as interesting for your taste buds as the other ones ;) You can eat them right from the skewer and children usually like them. They are quickly made and cook fast but it's hard to get sated by them so don't choose this method when you have to feed a hungry crowd... (these sticks are lightweight, so one skewer is enough)\n.\nOn the bottom of picture 1 you see thicker slices of eggplant and zucchini with some veggi pieces added.

(This step alleviates the need of having to cut through the already baked rusks, which can be challenging and crumbly at best, it helps you break the fingers apart at the end of the baking process).\nBake the rusks (in the oven, duh!) for about 45 minutes at the pre-set 160 degrees Celsius (or for our Imperial Friends - 320 degrees Fahrenheit).\nWhen the rusks are nice and golden, remove them from the oven and ensure the first cut is still there by sliding a knife through the bake. (Switch off the oven!)\nGently pull them apart, without burning yourself!, and then arrange it on the oven's grids. I usually place a baking sheet with grids on the lowest setting (see photo) to catch all the crumbs.

The usual flatbreads are wheat-flour tortillas, lavash, orpita; the filling usually consists of cold sliced meat, poultry, or fish accompanied by shredded lettuce, diced tomato or pico de gallo,guacamole, sauteed mushrooms, bacon, grilled onions, cheese, and a sauce, such as ranch or honey mustard.\nMexicans, Armenians, Greeks, Turks and Kurds have been eating wraps since before the 1900s. Mexicans refer to them as tacos, and they come in different ingredient varieties, such as corn, flour and wheat.\nThe wrap in its Western form probably comes from California, as a generalization of the Tex-Mex burrito, and became popular in the 1990s. It may have been invented and named at a southern California chain called \"I Love Juicy\" in the early 1980s. The Bobby Valentine Sports Gallery Cafe in Stamford, Connecticut is sometimes claimed to have invented the wrap at about the same time, but Valentine is diffident about it: \"Well, that's legend and folklore, but until somebody disputes me or comes up with a better story, I'll say I invented the wrap.\" Beth Dolan of Stamford, Connecticut is the waitress credited for serving the first wrap after the restaurant had ran out of bread. Moreover, Valentine's own story dates his use of the name 'wrap' to the mid-1990s, after it is documented in California. A wrap is different from a sandwich: a sandwich has two distinct layers which are the top and bottom pieces of bread.

I know I should probably make my cupcakes from scratch because that it the way all mom's do it, right? Well, not this one. I have no shame in my game when I say that \"I ain't got time for that\". I work 40+ hours a week, I am training for a half marathon, I am on numerous committees and I am a wife and a mother of two young boys who have their own committments that I have to be there for, so I just don't have time to bake from scratch. I also don't use a recipe which can be good and bad. If i make something super awesome it is pretty hard for me to recreate it since I am just winging it and throwing stuff together. So the fact that I am writing receipe for something I made up is truly ironic.\nNot all the ingredients are shown in the picture so don't try to go off the picture and then get mad at me when it doesn't turn out.

Add in the lemonade mix. The batter will get frothy because of the citric acid. FYI the molecule formula of citric acid is C6H8O7. Holla! Science nerd in the house! Also at room tempature citric acid looks like granulated sugar. I found this out the hard way. In 7th grade our science teacher was discussing something (I wasn't paying attention. I was staring at the cute new guy) and the teacher came up to me and offered me something I assumed was sugar. He said it was \"edible science\"...rubish, is what I say! Pure rubish! As soon as I put it isn my mouth my eyes started to water, my face contorted and I started cry. Long story short, I never lived the \"citric acid incident\" ever again, and I never did date the cute new guy. Junior high sucks.\nBack to the cupcakes...I like to use an old school whisk to combine my ingredients. The clumps break down and you don't over beat your batter. No one likes a overbeaten batter, particularly the batter.\nRight before you are ready to start filling the liners, add in the FROZEN BLUEBERRIES. Why frozen, you ask? Good question! The reason is that when you use frozen berries they won't sink to the bottom. They evenly disperse in your cupcake and as an added bonus, the batter doesn't turn purple like it would if you used non-frozen berries.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXF/T9G7/HW1MB2CL/FXFT9G7HW1MB2CL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Stir It Up, Stir It Up"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Have you ever read the directions on the back of a cake box?

I have had this one for years and it works like a charm. Every time I use it I get perfect portion of batter for cupcakes and I don't have to guess if the liner is 2/3's full.\nWhen you have the liners full, place in the oven for 25-30 minutes until a cake test or tootpick comes out clean.

I can make a mean buttercream, but I typically make it with Crisco (I know, complete misnomer). I never found a buttercream recipe that was made of butter that I actually liked and that could hold its form like frosting made with vegetable shortening does (until now). So when I was pulling this recipe together, I knew I wanted to use honey because of its summery sweetness, but vegetable shortening buttercream tastes heavy, so I needed a light frosting that could hold its form. With that in mind, I gathered the following ingredients:\n1 1/2 sticks of butter (softened)\n1/3 cup of honey\n4 cups of powdered sugar\n1 Tbsp meringue powder\n1 tsp vanilla extract (not the imitation, get the real stuff)\ndash of milk\nBlueberry perserves\nZest of 1 lemon", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNH/OFTU/HW1MB2CI/FNHOFTUHW1MB2CI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Let's Make Some Frosting"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Add the butter, honey and vanilla extract and mix it until it is smooth. Next I put in the meringue powder. Meringue powder gives buttercream form. You know how bakery frosting has a crispy feeling to it...that is the meringue powder. Some people like it, some don't. It doesn't have any flavor, so if you don't use it the flavor of your frosting won't be impacted. I like using it with buttercream because it makes the frosting look good and it gives the frosting a nice sheen (insert your own Charlie Sheen joke here).\nI use a Kitchenaid mixer (Best. Gift. Ever.) and I found that when I add powder sugar and turn on the mixer, my kitchen looks like Mt. St. Helen's erupted. Powder sugar finds its way in every crack and creavice in my kitchen. So now I put a dish towel over the mixer when I add the sugar to keep the sugar explosion to a minimum.\nContinue adding the sugar slowly as each cup should be mixed smooth. If the frosting gets too thick, add a splash of milk. I used vanilla almond milk because I like the taste and thought the vanilla flavor would add to the frosting taste, but any kind of milk will do.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FC0/V11E/HW1MB2CA/FC0V11EHW1MB2CA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9H/AJQT/HW2N538L/F9HAJQTHW2N538L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTJ/IBTW/HW2N533B/FTJIBTWHW2N533B.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Mmmmm Frosting Goodness"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "By now you have pulled your cupcakes out of the oven and let them completely cool.\nTo frost the cupcakes I used a disposable frosting bag and a star tip to frost these cupcakes, but I was just being fancy.

Don't forget to tip your waiters and waitresses!\nAfter frosting them (fancy or not fancy), drizzle blueberry perserves on top of each cupcake. A little goes a long way.I will own up to the fact that drizzling is not one of my strong points. It looks like I mastered the art of plopping perserves but I need to work on my form. As a final touch, I put a little lemon zest on each cupcake. This balances out the sweetness of the honey and the perserves with just a hint of zest that enhances the lemon cake and compliments the perserves and honey buttercream. The perserves and lemon zest tie the whole cupcake together. Like a good rug.

So when I would ever get tired of coffee, I can send back my 3D-printed parts to Filabot (they have a recycling service) and I can remelt and reuse the aluminum for new projects. I tried using as much locally produced parts as possible and using as many components as possible which are not related to a specific model or product.\nI made everything by learning from online tutorials, by using as much scrap material as possible and by utilizing the local fablab: Fablab Genk.\nYou will need a 3D-printer (I used the Makerbot Replicator 2X from Fablab Genk for the 3D-printed parts), a setup for casting aluminum and the right tools for assembling the internal components to each other and to the casing.\nNOTE: This is a prototype, so some components or parts might have to be optimized. If there are any suggestions for improvement or any mistakes in my instructable, please let me know so I (or you) can adjust it.\nPlease keep all safety aspects in consideration. Electricity can be dangerous so double check everything before testing. I'm not responsible if anything goes wrong. Never leave the coffee maker running alone.

But that's what they also mention on their website and is because of the use of recycled sources that this might occur.\nSo I ordered two more colours: red & black.

Basically you fill up the drag with sand, then place the 3D-printed model on top and fill in the gaps on the side. I then cut down the sand, so that the model can be taken out afterwards. After applying talk powder you fill up the cope.\nWhen the cope is filled with sand I open op the mold and get the model out. I also make a hole where the aluminum will be casted through. I know it's not according to the best aluminum casting technique, but it works. If there are any advices on how I can adjust the sand mold for a better casting with this shape, let me know. Or ideas for making a better cast-able shape are also welcome.\nYou need to cast part 1 two times as a left and right side. It's better if you sand the 3D printed model before making the mold, so the model loosens better from the sand. One of the 2 sides needs a 'bump' where we will fix the heating element later.\nI made the bottom of the coffee maker out of aluminum so it has a heavy and stable base. It's also stronger for fixing the heating element. But there are ways to attach the heating element in a plastic 3D-printed model without having to use aluminum. The reason I chose to use aluminum was because this project was about searching for techniques for local producing and recycling. Casting aluminum & 3D printing with plastic from recycled sources came out as useful techniques, also because of the possibilities to share digital models.\nI used oil based sand because I'm still learning how to cast and thought this was the safest method, instead of mixing my own sand with water like you can find on other tutorials.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2P/YR6Z/HVQNXAFL/F2PYR6ZHVQNXAFL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGC/VVG1/HVQNXAGH/FGCVVG1HVQNXAGH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNS/E1BR/HVYQ7X16/FNSE1BRHVYQ7X16.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F70/9VE4/HVYQ7XEU/F709VE4HVYQ7XEU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMO/RGQP/HVYQ7XE4/FMORGQPHVYQ7XE4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRX/48JW/HVYQ7XDP/FRX48JWHVYQ7XDP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR1/83DF/HVYQ7XCV/FR183DFHVYQ7XCV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXH/C314/HVYQ7XP5/FXHC314HVYQ7XP5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9R/MWER/HVYQ7XP7/F9RMWERHVYQ7XP7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6C/8HPY/HVYQ7XPC/F6C8HPYHVYQ7XPC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4U/NKBH/HVYQ7XRT/F4UNKBHHVYQ7XRT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGQ/E69K/HVYQ7YHC/FGQE69KHVYQ7YHC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFX/MXG5/HVYQ7YIR/FFXMXG5HVYQ7YIR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5L/BYEI/HVYQ7YK6/F5LBYEIHVYQ7YK6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHL/P9Q0/HVYQ7YLK/FHLP9Q0HVYQ7YLK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN3/ZSY9/HVYQ7Z0V/FN3ZSY9HVYQ7Z0V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAV/X09U/HVYQ7Z3H/FAVX09UHVYQ7Z3H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDV/U9AN/HVYQ7Z50/FDVU9ANHVYQ7Z50.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSN/N0SJ/HVYQ7Z5F/FSNN0SJHVYQ7Z5F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F15/8A4S/HVYQ7Z6Z/F158A4SHVYQ7Z6Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8W/OZV4/HVYQ7ZUS/F8WOZV4HVYQ7ZUS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWR/K4OH/HVYQ7ZW8/FWRK4OHHVYQ7ZW8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKX/WZGV/HVYQ7ZXO/FKXWZGVHVYQ7ZXO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYI/5JUS/HVYQ7ZZ2/FYI5JUSHVYQ7ZZ2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F44/DRNK/HVYQ801R/F44DRNKHVYQ801R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBG/YEQA/HVYQ80IC/FBGYEQAHVYQ80IC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT0/4VI4/HVYQ80JP/FT04VI4HVYQ80JP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVN/08IB/HVYQ80ML/FVN08IBHVYQ80ML.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8P/P8KU/HVYQ80NY/F8PP8KUHVYQ80NY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWB/RZ1W/HVYQ80PA/FWBRZ1WHVYQ80PA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1O/IGSI/HVYQ8151/F1OIGSIHVYQ8151.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ7/YH81/HVYQ816H/FJ7YH81HVYQ816H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBI/SM77/HVTLV3KN/FBISM77HVTLV3KN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9B/R8W8/HVTLV3KP/F9BR8W8HVTLV3KP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FII/SXB5/HVTLV3N8/FIISXB5HVTLV3N8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL6/I0AR/HVTLV3OC/FL6I0ARHVTLV3OC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEH/7UMX/HVTLV3QS/FEH7UMXHVTLV3QS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Make Mold for Sandcasting Piece of Case in Aluminum"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "I made a furnace for melting aluminum out of an old fire extinguisher by checking out other instructables:\nhttps://www.instructables.com/id/Oven/\nI used scrap aluminum from the Fablab, old aluminum cans and trash aluminum foil to melt and cast into the mold.\nRemember safety: read and learn enough about this before trying it out and use enough safety gear to protect you from any mistakes.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRS/4UJG/HVS19IDT/FRS4UJGHVS19IDT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAI/H8ST/HVS19IF5/FAIH8STHVS19IF5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD4/G33A/HVQFDWMQ/FD4G33AHVQFDWMQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F61/IS92/HVQFDWMT/F61IS92HVQFDWMT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5S/IEKG/HVQFDY00/F5SIEKGHVQFDY00.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9L/354A/HVQFDY07/F9L354AHVQFDY07.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS5/WPAC/HVQFDY0Y/FS5WPACHVQFDY0Y.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Melt Aluminum & Cast Piece"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Saw off the not wanted aluminum from the part and smooth down the model.

In the side of the water reservoir there is a valve which makes sure the water doesn't go up on that side, therefore pushing it through the other side upwards.\nHere is a more visual explanation video on youtube by Crazy Builders:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COKlObhGt50\nSo, to make sure the element heats up to the right temperature you have to use a thermostat. This will interrupt the electric circuit when it reaches the stop temperature of the thermostat. I used a thermostat of 105\u00b0C, just above boiling point but I'm thinking a lower one (90\u00b0C for instance) might work as well, if not better.\nThe heating element I ordered has a small piece welded to it where you can fix the thermostat.

When cold and thirsty drink has almost become synonymous with store bought carbonated drinks, this summer let\u2019s quench our thirst with healthy homemade Falooda. Falooda, also called Paloodeh is a Persian origin dessert-drink. Traditionally, Falooda is rose flavored milk served with a combination of jelly, basil seeds and, a special type of arrowroot vermicelli. I prefer Falooda sans vermicelli. There are a lot of varieties and flavors in Falooda, but I am going to present my favorite version; it is a quick-fix drink that needs no cooking at all, except some preparation at least 2 hours in advance.\nFalooda is the lifeline of people in south asian countries like India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Middle East. It is an indispensable drink in southeast asian Islamic culture in summer, specially during their religious fast days. The milk and basil seed combo is best known to replenish the lost nutrients after a day-long fast. Basil seeds are intentionally included to combat heat related sicknesses such as hyperthermia and lethargy. Apart from the health benefits, addition of jelly and ice cream makes falooda a favorite summer drink to kids as well. Falooda will be an interesting intro into the western food-culture especially when summer is approaching.\nUnlike asians, westerners celebrate summer. We welcome summer, enjoy the heat, and fondly tan our skins under hot sun. Although our frozen nerves crave to soothe itself in the heat of summer, still a cold and refreshing drink like Falooda in scorching summer is divine.", "title": "Making of Falooda - a Cold Drink for Summer", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Making-of-Falooda-A-Cold-Drink-for-Summer/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Ingredients:\n2 cups of Whole Milk\n3 tablespoons of Dabur Rose Syrup\n2 teaspoons of Tukmaria/Basil Seeds\n1/2 pack of Strawberry Jelly crystals (store bought ready-made jelly can also be used)\n2 scoops of Vanilla Ice cream\n3 teaspoons of Sugar\n6-7 Almonds\n6-7 Pistachios(optional)\nNote: The items listed here are easily available in any Asian/Indian stores.\nTime Needed:\nTotal Time: 2 hours and 25 minutes\nPreparatory Time: 2 hours 10 mins\nMaking Time: 15 minutes", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXJ/E4KW/HV9I274P/FXJE4KWHV9I274P.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Ingredients and Time Needed:"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "1.
