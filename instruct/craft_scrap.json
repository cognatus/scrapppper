There are a lot of substitutions you can make for tools, but each tool makes the job easier!\n+ Ruler/straightedge - there's no substitute for a good ruler and straightedge. I like mine to be clear, so I can get the most precise cuts I can.\n+ Knife - I use an X-Acto knife, and sometimes just a single sided razor blade. The X-Acto does a great all-around job.\n+ Pricking irons - this tool makes the holes that the stitching will join. An awl and ruler can substitute, but the even spacing in the pricking irons makes it much easier to get consistent spacing.\n+ Groover - this makes grooves to tell me where to put the stitch holes. Can be substituted with a pencil and ruler, but the groover makes it so much easier!\n+ Contact cement - this acts as glue to hold to leather together during stitching, but also prevents the edges from separating during normal use. Not necessary, but helps things look nice.\n+ Needles and thread - I use between 2 and 4 needles, and waxed polyester thread. Definitely necessary!\n+ Beeswax and burnishing tool - Edge burnishing essentially polishes the edges of the wallet, and makes it look refined. Beeswax keeps it together and looks even more shiny!\n+ Mallet - I use the mallet to hammer the pricking irons through the leather.\n+ Leather - This is Chestnut Buttero leather from Conceria Walpier in Italy.

The needles are threaded through the hole, and then that needle pierces the thread about an inch from the end. This holds the thread on the needle during stitching without a knot.\nTo begin, I pull one needle through my first hole, and make sure the thread length on either side is equal (pics 2, 3).

I hope you are excited to get started with weaving!\nToday, you're gonna learn a technique called coiling technique. One of the four main basketry waving techniques. Also known as African weaving style.\nI am Ana and I'm the person behind this instruction. I am very excited to introduce you to this technique!\nCoiling technique is an easy technique to follow, especially if it is done in one color. By following it, we are going to make a continuous spiral that is going to be the basic form of our brooch.\nTo get started with weaving this brooch you're going to need very few materials and approximately 2.5 hours. You don't need a loop!\nMATERIAL:\nsynthetic rope,\nraffia,\na needle,\na lighter\nbrooch needle,\nand beads of any kind you like.\nA ROPE: The brooch is not supposed to be very big, that's why the rope shouldn't be very thick. The thickness I suggest is 6-7 mm so we can form 3.5 rounds of a circle, ending with the with of a spiral of 5 cm. Sometimes the end of a rope can be very messy. Before starting, cut the end of the rope and heat it with a lighter around the edge. The heat is going to melt the long threads and make the end a bit harder and less messy.\nA NEEDLE: The needle you are going to need is any needle with a big eye but if you are not so careful generally, please, avoid needles with a sharp ending and instead use a needle without it.", "title": "Brooch Weaving", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Brooch-Weaving/", "section": "craft", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "To start a spiral take the rope and place it on the table. It is good to sit at the table while you're weaving in order for your hands to have more space and can move freely backward and forward.\nTake a piece of raffia and put its end 2-3cm inside the rope, opposite of the end of the rope. Now, start wrapping the rope with raffia going from you and to the front until you wrap 5-6 cm and can form a small spiral. The spiral should be big enough so you can easily hold it. Pay attention as the shorter spiral has a tendency to unroll and is very difficult to hold. In the beginning, you are going to feel tension and spasm in your fingers but be patient, after you secure your spiral it is going to be much easier to maneuver it.

For securing a spiral you need a little bit of patience in the start.\nHold the spiral with your left hand ( if left handed), the raffia should be hanging down from the outside edge of the spiral.\nPut raffia string, from underneath, in between the first, outer circle, and the middle one. Now raffia is in between two circles of the spiral. Go over the middle circle to the middle hole of the spiral. Then, from underneath, go with the needle up, again in between these two circles. After you go up and over the outer circle you are going to appear in the same position as when you started securing the spiral. Now, from underneath go with your needle up, in between the circles. You have formed number 8 around the ropes. This is going to be our security stitch. If you feel that the secured point is not enough strong repeat the 8 stitch. If you are satisfied, just go over the rope out from your body and you will appear in the same position as when you started securing the spiral.\nNow, we will continue the 8 stitch as many times as possible, not in the same spot but going from the outside in the center and from the center towards you and back. Repeat this many times and you are slowly going to see the difference in how strong the spiral became.\nOnce when you are satisfied with the result, go to our starting position from this step, and continue wrapping the coil. You will probably need to wrap 6-7 times. Then it will be the time for another 8 stitch to secure your spiral.\nAfter every 6-7 wraps, you will do the 8 stitch.\nTIPS:\n-when you start making your spiral maybe the rope is going to be seen in the middle.

Depending of the thickness of the yarn, I use between 2 and 6 threads. The ideal amount in my opinion is 3 strands of DK (like DROPS Karisma). I needed to feel in my hands what quantity worked well, and I tried to get that feeling for warp and weft of each square. Then, my only concern was about colors.\nI dived into my stash of old school, ugly, lablelless balls of yarn, and made boxes by color. I had only one rule when weaving for this project : use only one color for the group of thread composing the warp/weft, or not too contrasting colors.\nWeaving those squares is a great memory for me. First, I chose the colors for warp and weft, with a little universe in my mind. I then warped the loom with the first color, and finally I looked the colors mixing together while weaving. It is comtemplative and very concrete at the same time, the perfect combo for me. One square is done in half an hour after a bit of training. Finished squares carry all the vibrations I felt when thinking of my universe of colors. It is very difficult for me to stop touching them, watching them, comparing the choices I made for this or that square... I find it irresistibly fascinating.\nIn the beginning, I was weaving only for colors.

Here they are :\nThis method will allow you to join and bind off at the same time.\nWith 6.5mm needles and DROPS Eskimo, pick up and knit 21 stitches along one side of a square. Knit 5 rows. You have now 6 rows (or 3 ridges) of garter stitch, with right side facing you. Take the square to join and place it ahead of your work, wrong side facing you. In other word, the two squares are right sides together. Insert your right needle into the first bound off stitch from the square to join, then into the first stitch on your left needle. Knit one stitch through the two stitches, the one from your knitting then the one from the square to join. You got one stitch on your right needle.\nRepeat : *Insert your right needle into the next bound off stitch from the square to join, then into the first stitch on your left needle. Knitone stitch through the two stitches. There are 2 stitches on your right needle. Pass the first stitch over the stitch you just worked. There is one stitch on right needle*.\nRepeat from * to * until there is only one stitch remaining on the right needle. Cut the yarn, pass the end into the loop and pull to secure.\nJoin the twelve square of one stripe into a long stripe, do it for the twelve stripes. Then, do the same to join the stripes together. Pick up 21 stitches per square and 3 per garter stitch border (one stitch per ridge), which makes 285 stitches to pick up along one stripe.\nI also added a border of 6 ridges of garter stitch (12 rows) around the whole blanket.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMR/YDB5/JTCSOUH0/FMRYDB5JTCSOUH0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA6/JI1E/JTCSOU5A/FA6JI1EJTCSOU5A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUX/79E1/JTCSOXV7/FUX79E1JTCSOXV7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Joining the Blanket Together"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Because this project wasn't enormous enough, I decided to line it with some white polar fleece.

It lead to me getting a few amazing pieces of wood, and following the project to make a pendant. I knew I wanted to use the other pieces to turn into my own version.\nNow, that is where it got a bit tricky. I wanted to use wirework, but everything I thought of felt like a mismatch to the material. Again and again I came back to the original project, rereading the introduction. Most important for me was to be able to come up with a design that fit the original thought behind it, yet also putting my own style into it.\nSeeing the remix contest pass by sparked the concept again in my head. Out of nowhere, I knew what to make of it - two circles, of which the inner one could spin around. Yeah. So, I sawed out a rough shape, took a piece of sanding paper, and went outside to enjoy the weather while sanding the outer ring. While walking, I realised how interesting the slight curve of the material was, and a new concept was born - using it in a bracelet rather than a pendant, fitting against my arm, some macrame for the bracelet.

As an artist, inventor and engineer, I wanted to do something new and innovative, something that I could show her when she's older and tell her how much she meant to us! We also had friends and family in 5 continents, so it had to:\nStand the test of time. ( So she could see it when she grows up! )\nNeeded to be small and flat enough to fit in standard postal envelopes.\nIt needed to be post-able without making security alarms going off on every conveyor belt!\nIt needed to be sturdy enough to withstand the stress of an intercontinental postal journey.\nI wanted it to be unique, not a greeting card you can buy from any grocery store.\nI wanted it to be interactive ( have some sort of user input )\nI wanted it to narrate some sort of story\nIt needed to be cheap to build as I was kind of struggling ( financially ) at the time!\nAt the time, I was in Paris, waiting for my papers to flight to St. Louis and join my pregnant wife! while there, I participated in a Hackathon and won an incubation prize-pack that included a two-month membership in a cool Maker-Space called Usine IO ( IO Factory ) which was truly like a candy-factory for me! with all sort of manufacturing machines available to members! I would be staying in Paris though, for only a couple more weeks max! so I had to start right away! I decided to go with my first idea and make a mechanical card, with user input, that would fit in an envelope and last forever!\nThis ended up being a very cool and lovely project, just what I needed in the difficult times of being stranded in Paris, away from my family and dealing with stupid bureaucracy!\nIt was such a great project that I thought, once I settled and more stable, I will share it with others! so I documented all the steps and took photos and videos, and, when, finally, was leaving the country, put the hard drive with all the documents, carefully, in my back-pack and jumped on the plane,... later-on, when I attempted to start writing the story and the making-of, the hard-drive did not work! it was saying that it's not formatted and was making a funny noise! all very sad signs of a corrupted hard-drive!\nLong story short, I lost a ton of photos and videos and documents and memories ( not only this project but also captured moments of good, and bad times during the last couple of years! ), What was left was the stuff that I've shared on social media or those that were backed up on the cloud, which was, only the last part of the project!\nAnd this is it!

I had, however, a ton of experience with design tools and technics, both in 3D and 2D, I know how a laser cutter cuts, technically, and was a master at using drawing tools to produce Vector files, I knew Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, and Corel-Draw, inside-out! Not only, how to use them, but how to make them work! I used to develop plugins for some of these tools!\nSo converting my sketches to precise Vector graphics, without losing precision when converting from one tool and format to others, was a breeze. There were times when some of these tools were not playing nice with others, and I simply opened the SVG file and edited some attributes manually to fix the conversion (especially from Illustrator to Inkscape, I remember, there was an issue ).\nThe process was pretty simple, import the sketch and use it as a background image with reduced transparency, draw the Vector are in the preferred tool ( AI in my case ), then export / convert to the Inkscape format ( which was the format accepted with the Laser Cutter Machine at Usine-IO ), double check the measurements and the color-codes and adjust/fix the values accordingly.\nThe laser cutter machine at Usine-IO was a really good one, you could send a file in multiple colors and ask it to treat each color differently, so for instance, Red could mean cut with a higher power (cut-through), blue could mean cut with a lower color ( more like a vector etch for text or marking ) and Green could mean Raster etching! so the idea was to put everything in one file and have the machine to pass through the design 2 times, once ( and first ) for etching graphics and once ( and second ) for cutting, which was very important decision as it would make the manufacturing process much much easier by eliminating the need to re-align the laser head in different passes and resulted in much more precision over-all.\nGears:\nAt first, I was intimidated by the physics and maths of designing gears! so my first approach was to use 3rd party design tools and plugins to design gears with correct ratio, tooth and what not! but it was a nightmare! the free ones weren't as sophisticated as one would hope for and the commercial ones were either expensive or were completely limited in trial mode. so I did a bit of research, found out what makes good gears ( the angle of attack, the number, and thickness of teeth, the ratio and what not ) and tbh, not only it wasn't that complicated, I also enjoyed it very much!\nSo I ended up designing the gears from scratch in Adobe Illustrator, I would draw a circle with desired size, divide it to desired segments, extruding/beveling each other segment and smoothing out the edges, I would leave a tiny space in my design, so the teeth wouldn't fit perfectly in each-other ( Thought that may cause the system to lock ), and everything worked out beautifully! I was thinking I can introduce a bit lubricant to make things smoother, but even that wasn't necessary! It also gave me the option to make prettier and lighter gears, reducing the overall weight and letting me to cut some of the other elements inside the unused space of the larger gears.\nSo don't be intimidated by the amount of literature going around designing gears and moving elements and mechanical physics! most of that stuff is to perfect things and some of it may not have any effect on anything at all, except for satisfying a university that paid a Joe to produce a paper about that thing! As an insider, I can tell you that a considerable amount of these paper, may actually, be completely wrong! and for the most part, that's a normal and expected thing!\nTLDR!\nBack then, there weren't a lot of free and good tools to generate gear designs, nowadays, however, a little googling will yield more promising results! for instance I found this website very interesting and easy to use ( https://geargenerator.com ), give it a try! .. there are also other ones just Google, or DuckDuckGo, or whatever!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPN/1T7G/JTWSDV5H/FPN1T7GJTWSDV5H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMP/RUHH/JTWSDR39/FMPRUHHJTWSDR39.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN0/LH8Q/JTWSDQV8/FN0LH8QJTWSDQV8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6B/GWIM/JTWSDS0R/F6BGWIMJTWSDS0R.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Converting Raster Sketches to Vector Designs."}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "At the time, Usine had four laser cutter machines, two big ones, and two smaller ones.\nTurned out these machines are very popular and are booked very often! this turned out to be a problem, each of these machines has a different level of precision, power, and calibration and having to switch between them make pieces that are not compatible with each other. Also, depending on the time of the day, the settings needed to be different! What would have made a clean cut on the first batch, 8 in the morning, would over-burn the edges by 4 pm!\nThe other big issue and the one that took the most time to overcome was, design-adjustments to accommodate laser features and characteristics. As I said, this was my first experience with Laser and soon I learned that lasers are extremely good at following certain cuts and designs but they struggle with some others, For instance, it would be much easier and take much less time and create much less vibration, for the laser head to follow a curved angle comparing to a sharp corner, even though that curvature adds computational complexity to the design.\nAlso, I learned that over-all, the calibration errors are more pronounced as the head gets farther from the zero origins, so, no matter how small the error margins of a machine is, it's always worth when the head is the farthest from Zero base.\nAlso, if you are getting weird shapes, like a slightly elliptical circle or if the start and end of a closed path do meet, before anything else, check if your medium is secured well enough to the base ( usually a honey-comb or a metallic grid ), I used small magnets and metal weights to prevent the medium to move around when the powerful laser head makes rapid moves around the machine ( shaking everything! )\nAnother pro-tip would be to think about the movement of the head when designing your path, for me, this saved a lot of time and made the cuts way more precise. The thing is that, depending on the material, the heat produced by the laser may make the material expand, shrink, deform or bend a little bit, and if you have many passes at the same region this may make the effect more dramatic. keeping this in mind when drawing your lines make a much cleaner and more precise cut. It also helps the machine to manage the smoke and fumes better ( by distributing the amount of smoke at a given time ), again, resulting in cleaner and more consistent cuts and reduces the burns and mirror damages. An easy workaround for this problem is to use multiple stroke colors in the design, each for one pass of the head and assign all of them to the same power, speed, and cut settings ( only to force the head to cut a color first, then the next and so on, to distribute and dissipate the heat ). believe me, this helps a ton!\nThere are some other common sense design decisions that you may have to make knowing how the laser cutter works, for instance, if you have multiple nested complete cuts (closed paths shapes inside each-other) of material ( which is great to save both time and material ), you can't send them all to the machine and expect it to go through them in the right order. If the machine cuts the outer shape first, the piece may fall into the tray and not be there when the head decides to start cutting the inner shapes! again, as a simple workaround make different stroke colors and make the head to start from the inner-most shapes to the outer ones.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNB/PYV5/JTWSF9YR/FNBPYV5JTWSF9YR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCH/V9YZ/JTWSFA31/FCHV9YZJTWSFA31.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCE/GW8Y/JTWSFA30/FCEGW8YJTWSFA30.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUB/TRK8/JTWSDW63/FUBTRK8JTWSDW63.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F75/D0VY/JTWSDW66/F75D0VYJTWSDW66.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F12/U3SB/JTWSFA5Y/F12U3SBJTWSFA5Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F57/GQSM/JTWSDVO7/F57GQSMJTWSDVO7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFN/FA1B/JTWSDVL0/FFNFA1BJTWSDVL0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2X/17NM/JTWSFA4G/F2X17NMJTWSFA4G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXA/1VDC/JTWSDWA5/FXA1VDCJTWSDWA5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3F/A2BR/JTWSDVU6/F3FA2BRJTWSDVU6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTY/68BS/JTWSDWA3/FTY68BSJTWSDWA3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Trial & Error With the Laser-cutting Machine!"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Making the design simpler / more minimalist:\nAs an architect, I learned to love simplicity!\nI tried different designs with different mechanical movement principles, including a planetary gear system ( which I produced as a different project to create a limited edition business card! ), I also tried different mechanisms to transfer circular motion of the gears to linear motion for the heads.\nThe final design consisted of 7 gears, used to transform the movement in different directions and two slotted and routed shafts used to convert circular motion to reciprocating motion. The gear ratio was designed to make the movement smooth and user-friendly. I also exposed part of one of the bigger gears and used it as the user-input to engage and power the system.\nReducing the thickness:\nFirst I used a 4-millimeter thick acrylic sheet for the outer layers and a 2-mm thickness for the inner layer.\nI also had the outer layers etched and carved, each 1.5 mm, to create a housing for the inner layer ( the gears ) so the overall thickness would be 8 mm, but after a few experiments, I decided to use 2-mm sheets for everything and eliminate the internal carving entirely, committing to an overall thickness of 6 mm. this turned out to be a very critical decision in the success of the project as it reduced the design and manufacturing complexity and made the design more error tolerant, saving the project, as, after the final batch-cut, I realized that there was some inconsistency in the thickness of the sheets which would have caused serious problems during assembly with the previous layout.\nReducing the Layers:\nAll the rotary elements ( the gears ) were put in one layer, there was only one small shaft extending from one layer to another ( to convert the circular motion to reciprocating one ). if the thickness was not a concern, the ideal design would need to have 6 layers. I eliminated half of the layers by embedding their functionality in other layers with two tradeoffs, first one was that one of the outer layers would need to have a moving element ( not attached to anything ) that would fall out! I fixed this issue with a simple solution, I put transparent scotch tape on top of the moving element, putting another layer of the tape on the side and only masking the exposed parts that were facing the moving part ( so it wouldn't stick to it! ).\nThe other issue was that the heads ( that were moving back and forth, giving little kisses to each-other! ) ended up with no layer at all! which looked actually pretty cool, making the visuals more interesting and letting me reduce the overall size of the card ( as the heads, now, could extend outside of the card boundaries when farthest from each other ), with the tradeoff of making those elements more exposed and in-risk of breaking during the shipment. My workaround for this issue was to make the attachment of the head to the slotted square the weakest link ( connected with very little glue ) so if there were any parallel stress ( which is not very likely to happen in an envelope ) the head would detach from the shaft, rather than breaking, and this, indeed worked, and between all the delivered copies, there was only a one case (to my knowledge) were the head was not connected, and even in that case, the receiver figured they just need to glue that back!\nIn the original design, there were also two additional, paper thick, layers, cut from slippery plastic sheets to reduce the friction between the layers ( and also for visual aesthetics ) which were eliminated in the final production ( for the most part! ) as it wasn't really needed!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FY8/5A8H/JTWSDZQJ/FY85A8HJTWSDZQJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8R/GGXB/JTWSE049/F8RGGXBJTWSE049.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBU/88F3/JTWSDZYL/FBU88F3JTWSDZYL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAC/RL5H/JTWSDZUZ/FACRL5HJTWSDZUZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIK/NFH5/JTWSDZXP/FIKNFH5JTWSDZXP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDX/OI2K/JTWSDZQP/FDXOI2KJTWSDZQP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSL/JOEB/JTWSDZRM/FSLJOEBJTWSDZRM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7G/D4T5/JTWSDZVV/F7GD4T5JTWSDZVV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTA/X3E3/JTWSDZRL/FTAX3E3JTWSDZRL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Perfecting the Concept!"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "I spend 80% of this projects time on pre-production, and that was the best thing I could have done! because of that, the manufacturing and production of the final batch was a joy!

I instead, booked my time at 10:30, and hoped nobody would decide to get out of bed earlier to come and laser cut stuff! and that turned out to be right, but even that wasn't enough time to cut and etch everything!\nI ended up, going 2-3 days trying to use any single minute the machines were available to finish my job, the most difficult thing saw to calibrate the machines ( as I had to use different ones ), but by the second day, I figured ways to do that very quickly and efficiently as well! I decided to keep pieces cut by different machines separately though, as I thought ( correctly ), the laser beam itself may not have the same exact size in two machine ( due to calibration differences or different brands/build and capabilities of tubes with different powers ) which added a bit of time and complexity to the next step, which was the assembly!\nIn this final batch, I used only 2 mm sheets with two different colors, dark (for the inner layer) and light green ( for outer layers ), I also cut a couple more sheets just in case some of them had issues ( which they did! as an architect/engineer you should know that everything that can go wrong, will go wrong! ), I also had the gears tagged/numbered in my designs so I could use the exact gear that was cut in its exact place, which helped a lot to make things work together ( remember in one of the steps I said the error margin increases as the laser head moves away from the origin? If you use the components that were cut close to each other with each other, you can work around those errors, since the two components close to each, both will have, almost, the same amount of error, which reduces the margin of error between the two by factors of magnitude. in the other hand, if you use 2 components from two opposite sides of the cut medium, there you'll have the largest amount of difference/error )", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSU/EJ77/JTWSE5CN/FSUEJ77JTWSE5CN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCZ/EPD7/JTWSE53D/FCZEPD7JTWSE53D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI8/1FEV/JTWSE59M/FI81FEVJTWSE59M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQM/O17U/JTWSE54P/FQMO17UJTWSE54P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F83/N9PT/JTWSE55N/F83N9PTJTWSE55N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBD/L5NU/JTWSE564/FBDL5NUJTWSE564.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3S/OIVM/JTWSE57W/F3SOIVMJTWSE57W.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Cutting the Final Batch"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "IMHO this may be the part that often gets the least amount of attention and causes the most amount of effort, cost and time in the manufacturing and prototyping.\nI knew that it's not going to be an easy task to assemble everything and because of that, I had this step in mind from the very first steps, especially during the design process I thought about assembly and designed the components in a way that I could make jigs for them to be able to place and assemble them fast and efficient but also very accurately!\nAnd that's what I did!

Being a research facility my office had electrical cable trays located throughout the ceiling. They looked like monkey bars set into the ceiling. It appeared to be the perfect habitat for a Sloth since they like hanging around and make very little commotion -- perfect for an office setting.\nSo Saul the Sloth was born. As most sloths do he moves very slowly. In fact so slow that no one sees him move from place to place but you know he moves since during the week he makes his way to different parts of the office. Some think he may be a bit nocturnal as he seems to move more at night. It has been fun to have Saul the Sloth around the office and to see where he gets moved to. Its a nice addition to liven up the atmosphere of the office.\nSaul the Sloth is made by printing a full-size image onto multiple sheets of paper that are mounted on foam core board with two wire hooks added to let him 'hang around'.", "title": "Saul the Sloth - 'Hanging Humor'", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Saul-the-Sloth-Hanging-Humor/", "section": "craft", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Materials:\nPaper\nFoam core board\nSpray Adhesive\nWire Coat Hanger\nMasking/Painters' Tape\nPaint Stir Stick or Ruler or Section of Yardstick (You are willing to sacrifice)\nScrap Cardboard\nPens - Broad Black and Fine-point Gray\nTools:\nRazor Knife\nPaper Cutter (You can use scissors if you have a steady hand.)\nWire Cutters\nHot Glue Gun & Glue Sticks\nGloves\nComputer with internet connection and Printer", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F04/RMWX/JF34ID6T/F04RMWXJF34ID6T.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Materials and Tools"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "We need a large sloth!

Despite all of the wonders, I'm going to focus today on the most basic of weaves: tabby, or plain weave. Most woven fabrics consist of two yarn components, a warp and a weft. The warp is generally the longer of the two, and is often held under tension on the loom. The weft runs perpendicular to the warp, and can incorporate materials with less tensile strength or that may be less conventional. In a tabby weave, the weft crosses the warp in a pattern of over one yarn, under the next yarn, over, under, over, and under throughout the width of the piece. This creates a balanced fabric with similar stretch along both the warp and weft directions. Changes made to the over-under pattern of the warp and weft creates the vast anthologies of weaving patterns that exist today.\nThis tutorial will focus on the use of a pin loom or other four-sided looms. Pieces made on these looms can be used as they are, often loved as coasters or hot pads, or combined together to create larger pieces, such as blankets, garments, or stuffed toys! My primary use of these squares has been as a sampling tool for my floor loom projects, which allows me to test different yarn, different densities of warp and weft, as well as color arrangements and palettes.\nA modern pin loom has pins along four sides of a frame, though every fourth pin location is skipped, creating a gap. Other looms will not have this gap, but the weaving is working just the same by skipping a pin on any other loom. Personally, for my sampling projects, I like having the non-pin loom because it allows me to easily adjust the number of times the yarn goes across in both directions. Your experience with any style of loom is of course personal to you, and I encourage the use of whichever style best suits your needs!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FB9/1U9U/JTWS3ZZ0/FB91U9UJTWS3ZZ0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: An (Very Brief) Intro to Weaving"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "A woven tabby square is done in four layers, the first three of which are strung layers placed one on top of the other, and a fourth woven layer which is actively woven among the previous three layers. The warp and the weft are each done in two halves, with each layer being constructed of alternating yarn and space between pins. By using this alternating pattern, this technique basically does 75% of the work for you.\nWhen thinking about the layers in the context of the tabby weave, this first strung warp layer will become all of the warp threads that will go over the fourth woven layer.\nAs you are stringing the warp and weft yarns across the loom, try to ensure that there is light tension on each of the strands and that the tension is consistent across the loom. In this style of tabby square, the goal is to have the tension of the warp and the weft be as similar as possible. The tension can be checked by gently pressing on several strands at a time to check that none have more of less give than their neighbors.\nSteps:\nSecure the warp yarn to one corner of the loom, generally this is the left corner closer to the weaver. Depending on the loom, this can be done in a variety of ways. Some looms offer a notch to slip the yarn into, a slip knot could be used around a pin, a loose knot around the frame, or a long loop that makes the first two warp threads. For my loom, I zig zag between extra pins that extend beyond the first corner.\nString the warp yarn from the furthest left space on the closer side to the furthest left space on the further side.\nLoop the yarn around the pins to the right and place the yarn between the second and third pin, leaving a gap space between the two spaces with the warp yarn.\nString the yarn to the space two pins to the right of the first yarn on the opposite side. Again, leaving a gap space.\nRepeat steps 3 and 4 across the full width of the loom. For the sake of this tutorial, the ideal is to end with the tail yarn at the opposite corner of the loom than where it started. Looking at the side of the loom from the outside, there should be alternating loops of yarn and gaps.\nPull the yarn around the outside of the pins at the far right corner. On a pin loom, this would be around the two corner pins and into the furthest top space on the right side of the loom. On my loom, this loop goes from the first gap above the corner into the first gap below the corner along the right side. This creates a loop around the corner that turns the warp yarn into the perpendicular weft yarn.\nOptional: Color changes between the warp and the weft yarns can easily be done at the corner. Tie a square knot to join the two yarns at the outside apex of the corner before proceeding onto the next step. Color changes can also be done in the middle of a step by knotting yarns to the outside of any side of the loom. For short color changes, I have carried yarn across multiple pins, but this does change the typical edge of the pin loom style square that may make it more difficult to join together with other squares.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOW/4FSD/JTWS3Z13/FOW4FSDJTWS3Z13.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWH/W4UM/JTWS3YZE/FWHW4UMJTWS3YZE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAE/6U61/JTWS3YXB/FAE6U61JTWS3YXB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHS/1KLE/JTWS3YWQ/FHS1KLEJTWS3YWQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Layer One: Warp One"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Layer two is worked almost identically to layer one, except that it runs perpendicular to the first layer. Before or after rounding the corner, many tutorials will suggest rotating the loom one direction or the other. In my experience, I may rotate the loom one direction initially, but will always rotate it into a \"home\" position where I am stringing the yarn away from and toward me, moving from left to right. I encourage you to experiment with your loom placement to find a position or positions that work best for you.\nI will use my home orientation to continue with these instructions, but remember that right will always be indicating moving away from the starting corner.

We will also be cutting our yarn, which can seem a bit intimidating because of needing to make sure you have enough to complete the project. However, it is easy to estimate! To ensure that I have more than enough yarn, I loosely drape the yarn across the loom the same number of times that I went back and forth on the first weft layer before cutting the long tail. Depending on the size of the loom, this can get to be quite long, so if it is necessary to join a second piece of yarn to shorten the working yarn, that can be done using the same method as described for color changes in layer one.\nSteps:\nCut a long tail of yarn and thread through a sturdy needle. Craft stores carry a variety of options that can be used for a needle, included weaving needles, doll jointing needles, or simply long darning needles. Any sturdy needle that is easy to handle will work just as well for this purpose.\nAlign the needle with the second furthest left space on the closer side of the loom. Using the needle, guide the weft yarn so that it goes under the layer one warp and over the layer three warp. This weft yarn should be going over and under the warps in an opposite pattern to the first weft layer. Finish the row by guiding the needle through the second furthest left space on the further side.\nLoop the yarn around the pins to the right and place the needle between the second and third pin from your first weft yarn of this layer, leaving a gap space over the space where the layer two weft yarn was placed. This is identical to the pattern used in the layer three warp layer.\nWeave the weft yarn across the loom, following the same under layer one warp and over layer three warp pattern described in Step 2. Continue until the needle can be guided to the space two pins to the right of the first yarn on the opposite side.

If the weft went over the last warp yarn, go under the first two warp yarns, then return to the over-under pattern used for the final weft yarn. This will secure the tail yarn. This step can be repeated with the tail yarn from the beginning of the square. Any other tails throughout the project can be woven in in a similar manner. Alternatively, ends can be left free and used to sew pieces together later.\nThere will be some shrinkage as the tension on the yarn is released, allowing the yarns to relax over and under one another. This loss is called take-up in the warp, and draw in in the weft. When using squares for sampling, this is a very important factor to take note of. Additionally, if the squares are intended to be part of a larger project, it can be beneficial to wash the pieces.

When wrapping the thread, pull it taut enough that it will not easily slip out of position (a bit of slide when pushed is ok) but also not so tight that it distorts the hoop. Don't worry if the spokes are perfectly evenly spaced. There should be just enough give to be able to push them back in place and a bit of unevenness won't be noticeable once you begin the weaving.\n1. Cow hitch knot the thread onto the hoop. Leave at least 4in/10cm for the short end of the thread to make a loop for hanging the hoop at the end. You can always trim it away at the end if you change your mind. Push the knot to the back side of the hoop. Rotate your hoop so that the cow hitch knot is at top. Make sure the cow hitch knot is secure and won't come undone. Feel free to knot it with an overhand knot (like doing a shoelace), but the cotton thread should have enough friction with itself to not unravel.\n2. Now bring the thread down so that it is now on the opposite side of the hoop. Also bring it so it is in the front of the hoop. Wrap it under the hoop, then bring it up to about 1 inch/2.5cm away from the right side of the cow hitch knot, bringing the thread back to the front.\n3. Now, with the thread in front, wrap it around to the back again, passing under the threads, and coming up and over the hoop about 1in/2.5cm to the left of the previous thread (position 2).\nAlways follow this pattern of passing the warp thread from the back of the hoop, under the crossed threads, then bringing the thread to the front of the hoop to wrap it around to the back when crossing.

The roving is what makes the puffs in the hoop.\nRoving is probably too thick in it's default form for the 8in/20cm hoop. We can thin it out by gently pulling from one end and stretching the fibres apart. Be careful not to pull it too thin or pull it apart completely.\nSwitch in the roving as you would any material and weave as normal. For roving and chunky yarns (or just a lot of yarn) you might find it easier to just ball it up and use your hands rather than the needle. On the \"over\" parts of the weaving, leave a loop or puff of roving. Don't pull it tight like the yarn. Leave a bit larger of a puff than you want, as when you weave more layers of roving or yarn, it will compress a little.

Don't cut with scissors as roving won't behave as nicely for weaving in the ends in the back if you do.\nI did a single circle of yellow roving, end with one extra puff to prevent a gap, then I wove more green to secure the roving into place.

It is time to complete the spaces you left between the half-hitches rows.\nTake a piece of the yarn of your choice, the length you want (it's not a problem to attach another piece of yarn if these one is too short to weave the whole space so don't worry about that).\nThere are many ways to weave your yarn, each way create a different pattern so you can play with it to make different parts in your wall hanging.\nI started with the basic weaving technics but first, let me teach you or remember you, some basic vocabulary of weaving.\nWoven cloth is formed when parallel yarns (or cords in our case) that are held taut are interlaced by a second yarn. As a unit, the taut yarn is called the warp; individual yarns (also called threads) are called warp ends. The yarn that travels over and under (or weaves) between the warp ends is called the weft; individual weft threads are called picks. Woven cloth is made by interlacing the warp ends with weft picks.\nAs I said earlier, there are many weaving patterns you can use on your work, but the most common is the basic weave pattern is a simple over and under pattern (the weft yarn passes alternately over and under the warp ends to weave cloth).\nYou can make up your own variations of the basic weave by changing the number of warps you weave under and over, for example:\nover 2, under 2\nover 1, under 2\nover 2, under 1\nYou will be surprised by the designs you can create with these simple patterns and combinations. There are a number of textural and decorative stitches you can add to your weavings. Here are a few of the most common.\nSOUMAK STITCH (illustrated in picture)\nSoumak stitch uses a continuous weft thread that loops around a group of warp threads, traveling from one stitch to the next, to create a raised texture or ridge. It reminds me of hand embroidery. A single row of soumak weaving creates raised slanted stitches. However, when you weave two lines together, slanting them in opposite directions, then something exciting happens\u2014it creates a braided effect.\nI mostly used this stich because I love the braided effect it gives.\nHow to do:\n1-Fold over the end of the weft yarn by 2 in. (5 cm). Tie this loop to the first warp thread on the left-hand side using a Lark\u2019s Head Knot. Begin working in the direction of the tails (moving from left to right). Tuck the short tail to the reverse side of the weaving.\n2-With your fingers, lift up the next two warp threads to the right. Pass the yarn underneath these two warp threads and then pull up to the left side of the weaving once more.\n3-Draw the stitch down toward the completed weaving.\n4-Lift up the next two warp threads to the right and tuck the yarn under again. Tuck so that the weft travels over four warp threads and back under two.\n5-Continue in this way until you reach the last warp thread. Adjust the size of the stitches as you go, if necessary. You will see that this creates a stitch that slants upward to the left. (Soumak stitch always slants in the opposite direction to the one in which you are working.)\n6-When you reach the end of the row, wrap the weft once around the last warp thread.\n7-To complete the braid with the slant going in the opposite direction, you will need to weave another row of soumak stitch. Lift up the next two warp threads to the left. Pass the weft over these two threads, then tuck the weft back under the raised warp threads toward the right again.\n8-Continue across the row, as you did before, so that the weft travels over four warp threads and back under two. The new direction you are working in changes the direction of the slant. To finish, wrap the weft once around the last warp thread on the right and tuck it to the back.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5R/78SJ/JTONBJ20/F5R78SJJTONBJ20.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPD/3GV4/JTONBJ6Z/FPD3GV4JTONBJ6Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIT/0IFU/JTONCFCG/FIT0IFUJTONCFCG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 14: Filling the Hole : the Weaving Part"}, {"step": 15, "steps_text": "Once you have the full line of double half-hitches, we have an extra string hanging over each side.
