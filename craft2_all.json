Either way you go, both are nice to have!\n\nSpread out your fabric, neatly folded so the right side is facing inward. Once that's done, you can draw out a pattern - there are two ways you can do this. Firstly, you can draw a single shape on the back of the fabric by freehand and see what you can do with it after you're finished sewing, while leaving yourself a quarter of an inch for the seam allowance.\n\nAlternatively, you can sketch a design on the piece of paper you have and make notes. Go for one abstract form, details can be added later. Cut out your pattern and trace it onto the back of the fabric; after that, draw the seam allowance. I went with the first option, since it was all pretty much in my head.\n\nPin the areas inside your pattern, making sure the space in between the fabric has no air pockets to ensure an even lineup while you cut and sew.

Lasts are used to manufacture almost every kind of footwear from sandals to riding boots. The last determines the size, style, toe-shape and heel height of the shoe. Even if you were to draw a shoe, you already denoting the last shape as soon as you sketch the toe shape. As a designer, the process of making a pattern cannot start in earnest before the shape of the last has been produced.\nHistorically, the process of last making has been a slow and painful one- a blank of wood is carved, rasped and sanded to create an exact shape, then this process repeated for the opposite foot. More recently 'repeating machines' have been used to trace the last shape and carve a new one.\nMaterials have changed through the years from wood such as hornbeam and beech to high density plastics, even to cast metals for heavy-duty factory operations.\nAs a shoemaker I make one off bespoke footwear, I tailor each last for the client and am then obliged to keep this last archived for them. This work is done by hand, requires a vast amount of labour, repeated processes and will often result in inconsistencies. I have been thinking for some time about how this process could use new manufacturing techniques to improve the accuracy and speed of last manufacture.\nIn this Instructable I will go through some of the methods that I have been experimenting with during my research.", "title": "Last Comes First", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Last-Comes-First/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "As you can see from the first image, there are many different toe shapes you can choose from even within the 'round-toe' category of lasts. There are many infinite variations on a round, almond, triangular, square or pointed toe- that goes for all aspects of the last too.\nToe shape affects style but also the way the shoe will perform- for example boot lasts tend to have a larger volume toe box plus a taller profile around the ankle, whereas a dress shoe will often have a sleeker and more pointed profile.\nA great place to start your journey as a last maker is probably to get hold of a second hand pair of lasts in your size and to start making adjustments to the toe shape using a rasp or grinding wheel. This is a part of the last which has most licence for alteration without affecting the fit too greatly. If you start adjusting the instep or arch support you may find you start affecting the comfort of the last.\nThis is how I began my first last- I turned a regular shoe last into a sandal last by making the toe shape very asymmetrical and also decreasing its depth.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIQ/D7T0/IUOI03ZV/FIQD7T0IUOI03ZV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKQ/CAQB/IUOI03CF/FKQCAQBIUOI03CF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Last Design and Basic Alteration"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "For this project, I will be using Autodesk Crispin Lastmaker software to help me produce my last.

This is quite a novel approach to printing as it is basic in so many ways yet also quite complex. The advantage is that it utilises readily available resources- paper and glue and produces a print that is completely solid at a fraction of the cost of FDM techniques.\nThe disadvantages are that like any paper printer, it is prone to jamming. The paper has a tendency to start peeling up at the corners and then causing the machine to jam. Of 6 prints (and counting) I did not get it to produce one 100% finished print before having an error! Luckily I did get one about 95% complete which was enough to extract a usable last from.\nDue to the size of the build plate (210mm x 297mm) I was unable to make my last in one piece (size12) so split the model and nested the pieces. I then joined them together with masking tape.\nThe result was great- the paper is densely glued together and tough- like a soft wood.

As you can see in this video time-lapse I managed to make a full pair of shoes on the lasts without too much difficulty (time-lapse video courtesy of Instructables legend Scott McIndoe aka makendo)\nThe problem with the lasts is when I came to attach the soles on to the uppers. The process involves a great deal of hammering, over several stages of the process. The impact to the last can be seen very clearly in the photos.

Don't make them too long, because it will be hard to work with. When you make some progress, you'll find the perfect length working for you.\nNext step is to make the start knot on the end of 3 pieces of yarn. I use different colors to make it more visible for you. Remember: don't tie the knot hard - make it quite loose, because in future steps you have to loose it.\nTECHNIQUE:\nI don't show you how to make braids. You should be familiar with this technique - when you do it right and when you do mistakes - because we will make it a little bit harder. But don't worry this is explained in this instruction.\nThe rug will be made of ONE SPIRAL BRAID.\nThe main idea of this rug is to use braid weave, which it connected to itself with no additional threads or other things. I don't know if you understand my idea, but don't worry and let's start making.\nFirst step:\nYou need to make a braid around 10-12 cm long.\nThen you should make a circle with this braid connecting start and end of it. There should be a little hole in the center (don't worry now).\nAnd this will be the most important thing about knitting this rug.\nMove the one inside (the dark one) piece of yarn through the first loop (outside) from down to up (it's important). Now you have full circle and connect start with ending.\nThan make a two braid loops (move all three pieces two times)\nRepeat: move inside (next to circle one - now orange) piece of yarn through next loop in circle. And make two full braid loops.\nAnd repeat, repeat and repeat making the spiral and getting the rug bigger and bigger. Don't worry if you make the one and half or one loop of braid - it's not important - the main idea it now to catch all the loops of rug - to make it strong and with no gaps and in circular shape. Remember - all the loops have to be quite loose, because it will be hard for you to move the yarn through them.\nWith length of yarn around 1,5m you should make 8 to 10cm diameter rug.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVC/0GUC/IVO4K3AB/FVC0GUCIVO4K3AB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4M/AFDQ/IVO4K3AV/F4MAFDQIVO4K3AV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0L/PGC9/IVO4K3BQ/F0LPGC9IVO4K3BQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUJ/3Q3J/IVO4K46H/FUJ3Q3JIVO4K46H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAV/KGRN/IVO4K4BF/FAVKGRNIVO4K4BF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5S/JJ0W/IVO4K4LJ/F5SJJ0WIVO4K4LJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSY/KZMS/IVO4K4R7/FSYKZMSIVO4K4R7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAH/RRDB/IVO4K4WY/FAHRRDBIVO4K4WY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F44/USOQ/IVO4K582/F44USOQIVO4K582.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1S/OENK/IVO4K52G/F1SOENKIVO4K52G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSS/01Y8/IVO4K5DG/FSS01Y8IVO4K5DG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRG/3M70/IVO4K5J4/FRG3M70IVO4K5J4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQX/R997/IVO4K5PB/FQXR997IVO4K5PB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Let's Start"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Now you should remember:\nthe side of rug with no start knot is your MAIN, VISIBLE side\nthe side of rug with start knot is the side where you will hide all the visible yarn connections.\nSo let's remove the knot.\nFirst you should turn the rug into the NOT VISIBLE side and loose the knot.\nThan you should move all the three pieces through the braid loops, to make it look natural and nice on the VISIBLE SIDE.\nConnecting:\nFirst you should connect two yarns together with SQUARE KNOT (instructions on pictures).

Darn in your tails at this point.\nUsing saftey pins (I like coloured ones, but they all work) pin the front of the brim upwards. And take a deep breath.\nNow.... take a spray bottle of water. Wet the hat again. Wet the inside and the outside. You want the hat wet, but not dripping.\nAnd..... throw it in the dryer on full heat. If you are feeling anxious about this step, check the hat every 5 minutes. Remember how big the hat was when you put it in, and try to surrender to the process.\nWhen the hat is dry, it will be smaller, and more felted. Feel free to repeat this process as often as you like, or as often as you dare. Eventually you will have a hat that the yarn is felted together, and the hat is smaller than when you made it.

This will help you save the unnecessary extra thread.\n2. Sewing tips: for hand-sewing leather, you need to follow the ONE AND ONLY sewing RULE for the stitches to be even. For example: the rule is \"Right-Up-Left\" means your RIGHT-HAND needle go through the hole first,then pull the thread UP, then LEFT-HAND needle through the same hole and tighten.\nHowever, it would be faster and easier for you to sew if you have a leather sewing clip.

I picked up crocheting because my boyfriend (now husband) loves beanies. He wears a beanie almost everyday so I wanted to make him a beanie for a Christmas gift. Since it was my first crochet project, I had a lot to learn and there were a few tips and tricks that I learned while making several different beanies that I will share with you here.", "title": "Crocheting a Beanie", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Crocheting-a-Beanie/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "If you've ever been into the yarn section of your craft store, you will find that there is an overwhelming amount of yarn to choose from and every brand and style is a little bit different. There are several important things that the yarn label will tell you about the yarn and every label layout is a little bit different. To provide some more information, see the photo of the crochet label as well as the corresponding numbered description below.\nFiber content - wool, cotton, acrylic, a blend, etc.\nRecommended size of crochet (or knitting) needle - the crochet hook size listed is a recommendation, the dimensions listed in the icon just to the left of the arrow with the \"2\" shows about how many stitches are in a 4\u00d74\u2033 swatch. Since the needle/hook sizes are suggestions, your results will vary depending on your gauge. If you are looking to create a pattern that requires close dimensions, I recommend that you create a 4 x 4 swatch to verify your gage.\nYarn weight - The number inside the ball of yarn represents the weight of the yarn. A \"0\" represent the finest size yarn and a \"7\" represents super bulky yarn.\nTotal length of the yarn - Depending on your project and the stitches and hook that you will be using, you may require more length of yarn than what the one skein contains, it's best to buy it all together at once if you know the total length required.\nLaundry care - The text and icons show if the yarn is machine washable or if other laundry care instructions are required.\nColor and dye lot number - If you are planning to use more than one skein of yarn, be sure to match the lot numbers. The yarn skeins may look the same when holding them next to each other. If different lots are used, you may end up with slightly mismatching color which will be noticeable when crocheted together.\nSelecting your hook: As mentioned above, the yarn label will provide you a recommended hook size. You can use this size. If you choose to use a size hook other than what is on the back, you should note that a smaller hook will result in the stitches being tighter or closer together and larger size hook will result in looser stitches.\nFor the beanie I created, I used the yarn and hook shown in the photos- Super Bulky Sweet Grass Yarn with a P16/10mm hook. This hook and yarn combination will leave some larger gaps between the stitches. The next step will show you how to get the right size hat regardless of what yarn or hook you use.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ7/5L5N/IVO4PFLR/FJ75L5NIVO4PFLR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFI/S6U6/IVO4PLQH/FFIS6U6IVO4PLQH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Choosing Your Yarn and Hook"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The way I look at a beanie is in three steps, regardless of what stitch you choose to use:\nStarting your beanie either by chains stitches or a magic circle\nIncreasing your beanie\nLengthening your beanie\nFinishing your beanie\nBefore you get started on your beanie, you'll need to know who will be wearing the beanie. Since everybody's head size is a little bit different, you'll need to know when to stop increasing the size of the beanie. I determine when to stop increasing by figuring out the diameter of the crown of the persons head.\nIn this instance, I will be making the beanie for my husband, so I form a circle with my hands around the crown of his head, as shown in the photos. For a gauge, my husbands head is a L/XL size on most patterns. When the beanie reaches about this size, I will stop increasing the beanie. You will probably notice that you may not be able to get the diameter of the increased yarn to be exactly the same size as the crown of the head, however, I would recommend going a little larger than the crown of the head to make sure the beanie is not too tight.\nOnce you know about how big to make the beanie, you are ready to get started!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F10/YPX3/IVO44LP3/F10YPX3IVO44LP3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Before Getting Started - Hat Sizing"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I like to start my beanies using a magic circle as opposed to starting with a chain loop. The advantage of the magic circle is that you can close the loop so there is no small opened circle where the chains were connected. The easiest way I have found to make the magic circle is as follows:\nHold your yarn holding hand out with your palm facing you.\nTake the loose piece of yarn with the tail draped over your hand and the end of the yarn at about your pinky.\nWrap the yarn around your hand once in a clockwise direction and hold onto the yarn where the loop comes together\nInsert the crochet hook behind your fingers and hook the yarn.\nPull the yarn through your circle\nPull the yarn over your hook and pull through the loop that currently on your hook - This creates a slip stitch so you can now release your hands from holding the circle opened.\nYou now have a wide circle that you use as the foundation for your next few stitches. For this beanie, I used a double crochet to create my magic circle, but you can use any stitch in its place. To start the stitches, I chain 2 by yarning over and pulling through the current yarn on the hook.\nCreate your first double crochet stitch. To do this, yarn over once and the insert your hook through the circle then wrapping your yarn over your hook and pulling through the circle. You will now have three loops on the hook. Wrap the yarn over the hook and pull through two of the loops. Again, wrap the yarn over and pull through the remaining two loops. That completes your first double crochet.\nRepeat Step 8 seven more time to create eight double crochets. (you may choose to do several fewer or more double crochets - either way you are creating your base for your increases)\nSlip stitch to your first stitch.\nNow, grab the tail of the yarn and pull it tight - this will cinch the circle shut and creating a tight circle.\nYou magic circle is now complete\nYou can place a marker (I just used a bobby pin, but you can buy stitch markers at your craft store) in the last stitch of the round, or the first stitch of your next round or both if you want.

You can use a yarn needle if you prefer but I just use my crochet hook to pull the yarn through, alternating pulling into the back of the beanie to pulling the yarn out to the front of the beanie. After waving the yarn in the beanie through a few stitches, you can chose to go back through the same stitches you just wove through which will keep it form unraveling. I actually ended up tying a small knot once I reached the other side of the beanie from where I fastened off. The reason I did this was some feedback from my husband saying that if he wore the beanie all day, he noticed it would loosen a little. By tying this little knot, it will keep the beanie from loosening too much that its uncomfortable from him to continue wearing.\nYou can now weave in the small tail the is still hanging out from the start of the magic circle.\nYou now have a completed beanie that is ready to wear and keep your ears and head warm for the upcoming winter season!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FO4/4VAK/IVO4PCKG/FO44VAKIVO4PCKG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCW/AP9M/IVO4UGNC/FCWAP9MIVO4UGNC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Finishing You Beanie"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "This final step is to give you the full pattern the way it would read if you download a pattern.\nTo create an XL Double Crochet Beanie, you will need:\nHook: 10mm\nYarn: 1 skein of Loops and Thread Cozy Wool 90yard,/82m, 4.5 oz/127g yarn\nch= chain\nsl st= slip stitch\nsts = stitches\ndc=double crochet\n[_]*= repeat what is inside the brackets\nTo Start:\nCreate a magic ring with 8 double crochets and slip stitch to join.\nRound 1:\nCh 2 and DC2 into all stitches around. sl st in top of ch2 to end of the round (16 sts)\nRound 2:\nCh 2.

A standard window box fan at $20 moves about 2500 CFM where as a $20 exhaust fan moves 50 CFM and in previous builds I've seen where people have used exhaust fans they didn't have enough power to pull through a filter. So rather than getting a larger more expensive exhaust fan I opted to keep this on a budget and I used a window box fan.

After making the Golden Goddess Headdress, which uses a padded wire base, I conducted more research and decided to try a different method. I really like the base of this headpiece. It is simple, fast, cost effective and a custom fit. I think you could use this base for many kinds of headdress/headpieces.\nFor this base you will want to gather the following items:\n1 Roll of Duck Tape\nA pair of Scissors\n1 Roll of Foil\nA Plastic Headband\n1 Foam Head\nSince you will be able to see some of the color coming through the jewels, I picked white duck tape. You can make this jeweled headpiece in multicolor or monochromatic jewels. If that is the case, you can elect whatever color duck tape you like.\nI used heavy duty foil but regular foil will work just fine.\nAlthough you do not have to use a headband, I would suggest it for this headpiece. The headband will add a little extra hug to the head which you will want with the weight from the jewels.\nI used a foam head from Michael's. They did have a female head, however, the male one was closer to the size of my head. If the size or shape is different from your own head, there are some adjustments you can make. If the foam is too big, you can cut, shave or sand it down to your measurements. If the foam is too small, you can use plastic wrap and/or masking tape to build it up.\nYou can use your own head for an exact mold. You will still use the steps that are to follow, however, will need a pen to make some marks on the outside of the duck tape layer before removing and trimming away the excess material. It would be helpful to have a buddy give you a hand with the foil, tape and markings. You will want to mark the bridge of your nose, both brow bones, both temples, the top of both ears and the base of your skull, this way you know where to trim it.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: The Base"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Start by taking sheets of foil and smoothing them over the head one at a time.

You could cut a peak in the back, in which case, I would suggest duck taping a stiff wire molded from the headband to the tip of the peak.\nWhen satisfied with the shape, remove from the foam head.

You can sometimes find long strands connected in this manner in the jewelry section at craft stores. I believe I got this necklace, at Burlington Coat Factory.\nThe rhinestone appliqu\u00e9 is just personal preference. I typical purchase my appliqu\u00e9s at Fabric Depot, but there are many designs you can find on eBay and Amazon for a great price. If purchasing online, be sure to look at the appliqu\u00e9s measurements, as sometime the photos can be deceiving. If you elect to use an appliqu\u00e9, apply it to the base with hot glue.\nDecide where you want your first strand of jewels to drape. Once you decide what length works best, bend the metal loops and unhook it form the strand. You will want to make two strands of the same length, if you want it to drape on both sides. If your necklace has a pattern, be sure to pay attention and make sure that both strands are completely identical.\nWith the sharp point of your scissors, poke a hole through the duck tape. Loop the metal hook through the hole and bend close with your pliers. Place a second hole where you would like the other end of the jeweled strand to end. Again place the open hook through the hole and then close with your pliers. Complete this for the opposite side.\nMeasure out where you would like your next strand and continue the process till you are happy with your draping jewels. You can also attach the strands to each other. I did this with the ones connecting by the nose.\nIf you hook into your appliqu\u00e9 like I did, use hot glue on the back side of the attachment.

If your trim has a pattern, be sure to buy a little extra, so that you can adjust it a little one way or the other.\nThere are many styles of trims that you can use for your headpiece. Trims can be made with beads, pearls, rhinestones, sequins, tassels, fake coins and fabrics. For example, you could use multiple layers of lace trim to create soft ruffles down the back.

If you do not have a wide selection, you will always feel like you are putting the same jewels right next to each other.\nOther needed items:\nHot Glue Gun\nGlue Sticks\nE6000\nScissors\nNeedle Nose Pliers\nPaper Plate", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F73/EIO1/IVO3ML1R/F73EIO1IVO3ML1R.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 12: Covering the Base"}, {"step": 13, "steps_text": "Start by adding all your appliqu\u00e9s.

If they have a metal loop on the back for sewing or stringing, try to remove them with plies.\nTip: Put E6000 around the outside of the back and a dab of hot glue in the center.

Continue this process of smearing glue and setting embellishments until the parts of the base you want are covered.\nTip: If you have a hard time picking up and placing the small jewels, try this trick. Cut the end off of a Q-tip. Place chapstick on the cut end of the Q-tip. The chapstick should stick the jewel to the end of the Q-tip so you can place it on the base.

As such, you will want to leave the wire overhangs accessible so that you can access and replace the foam. If this small access point bothers you, you can try covering it with the flowers or feathers you are using or hot glue a large jewel over it.

Not a problem.\nRe-positioning-\nHave you come to realize that maybe you should have positioned the foam an inch further back or maybe a hair higher. That's okay, we can fix it.\nHere is how you do it-\nStart by removing the duck tape that is holding the wires down. Remove both wires. Holding onto the foam, give it a good twist. It should pop right off. There will likely be some green foam and glue left behind. You can remove it with your fingernails or a sharp object. If you are replacing it, shape a new foam piece to fit, and glue and wire back into place. If you do not plan on replacing it, put a nice new layer of duck tape down and you're good to go.

The practice dates to ancient Greek times where a Soldier would carry the commander's \"Coin\" that would prove his identity on the battlefield and for organizational purposes.

Just look at linoleum block prints online to see the quality of a linoleum image. This limitation actually works for you since most successful coin designs have a single bold element (per side) that has deep symbolic meaning....or just looks cool. Once you start cluttering up your design with lots of detail, lettering and decoration, the meaning gets muddled and hard to decipher.\nSize: Since you are using clay, you can make your coin any size. However, the low fired clay I used and the pit firing method does not make for extremely strong coins, so it is best to keep it below two inches (51mm) in diameter. The smaller the size, the less chance of breakage. For this design, 1.75 inches(45mm) seemed like a good diameter. Also the biscuit cutting tool comes in standardized sizes, so working within those sizes will make your life easier.\nThickness: We will never reproduce the mass of a metal coin with clay, but making your clay coin thicker than regular challenge coins will go a long way to make it feel more substantial.

I use the old fashion method of tracing over the image with carbon paper between the design and the linoleum block. Again, the lettering needs to be reversed if you want the lettering on the coin to be readable.\n3. Carve the linoleum. Important to remember that this is a little different than block printing. What you carve away will be raised in the final image (the opposite of printing). Pro tip: if you need to make small round holes, use an appropriate sized drill bit.

Feel free to use high fire clay if you like. It will make a stronger coin, but since I do not have a proper kiln, I chose the low firing clay so I could fire in a pit.\n1. Roll out your clay into a slab. You can put dowels on either side to control the thickness. You should aim for about 1/4 thick (6.33 mm).\n2. Take the cutter for the size coin you want and cut rounds from the slab.\n3. Prep your linoleum blocks with a release agent. I tried corn starch which worked, but had to reapply every time. I finally decided to switch to oil. I used 3 in 1 oil, but cooking oil will work as well. It will burn off later anyway. Brush on the oil and it will last 4 or 5 coins before you reapply.\n4. Take a round of clay and put it on the more complex design linoleum block. Take your rolling pin and roll the round into the linoleum stamp. The clay will spread out, but don't worry too much about this. Once you are satisfied that the design is impressed into the clay, place the less complex linoleum block on the top and press down. Tap the top block with a rubber mallet to impress the top design into the clay.\n5. Separate the linoleum blocks from the clay. It should come apart easily.

So I switched to a pit fire method where the coins were in both oxidizing and reducing environments, so some turned black (reducing), some white (oxidizing), and some in between. Actually quite pleased with the variety.\nFor pit firing:\n1. Dig a hole or use a fireproof metal bucket. Put your dry clay coins in the bottom on a layer of sawdust or wood shavings. Bury with sawdust, wood shavings, cow pies, newspaper or whatever will burn. Put charcoal and wood on the top. Use kindling and newspaper to ignite the mass and let burn down to coals. Cover with a metal cookie sheet or something metal to trap the heat.\n2. Let everything burn out and cool overnight.\n3. Fish out your coins without burning yourself.\n4.

They are cheap and easy to mass produce, so even if a greedy geocacher took more than their fair share, you could easily produce more.\nI was not that happy with the misalignment of the front and back of some of my earlier coins. Also was not happy that the coins ended up with different thicknesses and sometimes, different thicknesses in the same coin.\nTo solve both by devising a better registration system that could easily reproduced, I used a larger 5x7 inch mounted linoleum block and made two coins at a time. These are 2 inch coins, so 2 per block pairs seemed good. If you produced a smaller coin, you may be able to get 4 onto a block pair.\nMeasure your coin designs carefully and put the two blocks face to face (insuring the registration is perfect). Then use rubber bands or zip ties to hold the registered pair together. Drill holes in all four corners of the block sandwich. A drill press would be ideal since it will give you a perfectly 90 degree hole, but a hand drill will work fine as well if you take pains to keep the hole straight.\nOnce done, thread a bolt through the holes and secure with a nut on the linoleum side. This also provides a handy way to control the thickness of the coin. If a thicker coin is desired, you can add washers or another nut to add thickness. For thinner coins, you will have to find a thinner nut.\nOperations: Roll out your clay thicker than the final coin thickness. Cut out rounds with your biscuit cutter and lay on the base block (the one with the bolts). Place the top block onto the registration bolts and hand press together. Place the sandwich on the floor and tap the top block with a rubber mallet until the top block comes to rest on the stops of the base block (the nuts). Gently pry apart the blocks. You will find that the clay has spread out larger than the desired diameter. Gently peel these away from the mold and place flat on a work surface. Again with your biscuit cutter, cut the coins to the final size. Lay your coins out to dry as flat as possible without disturbing the design. If you own a dehydrator, the whole process can be sped up tremendously.\nThese \"Star Wars\" themed coins were produced in honor of Carrie Fisher to give to grieving fans (to include myself).

So, I just started leaving them where people could find them and take if they wanted. It pleased me to add a little mystery to people's lives even though I would never know. Since no thought in this world is original, this artist has been doing this sort of thing for decades!\n2. On the technical side, I finally pulled the trigger on a tabletop furnace that can easily reach the temperatures required to fully mature the low fire clay body into ceramic and opened my eyes to the wonderful world of (low fired) glazes. The addition of the furnace added more complexity as well. Instead of a simple pit firing, I had to figure out the world of temperature ramps and soaks. The controller on the furnace is not very intuitive, but you can actually figure it out with the help of online videos. I'm of two minds about this innovation:\nPros - Makes the coins fully matured ceramic increasing their strength and with glazing increases their intrinsic value. Given the exact temperature control, I've decreased my loss rate from 10~20% to zero decreasing time lost and frustration.\nCons - The loss of the differential coloration intrinsic to pit firing. I've tried pit firing after bisque firing, but the coins just look dirty. Adds time since the ramping and soaking schedule is slow and requires a bisque firing and a glaze firing (assuming you will glaze). The glaze has to be done in smaller batches since the pieces can't touch or they will be fused together. The furnace isn't cheap. This model with the temperature controller was $550.

The great thing about them is they don\u2019t need a frame, they hold their shape by themselves.\nIf you only use one colour you can make a lampshade like this for around 3 \u00a3 (4$). More colours are nicer though. It takes about an afternoon to make one, depending on the size of the lamp.\nThey are crocheted with easy to do stitches. I\u2019m showing here how to make 2 different shapes, the cylinder and the cone shape. Of course the possibilities for experimentation with shapes, stitches and colours are endless.\nConstructing the lamp is also quite easy. You can make the cable as long as you like, and with a few hooks on the ceiling, you can fix them to light up any space in the room. Also you can position them high or low, as you like. All the pieces needed, can be bought cheaply.\nI thought of it too late, but there are these beautiful old style filament light bulbs available, I think they would be the perfect bulbs for the lamp.\nCrocheting with wire\nCrocheting with wire is not so different from crocheting with yarn. Before you begin the project just play around with the wire to get a feeling for it. Crochet a few rows in different stitches, if you like.\nStretch it in different directions to see what happens when you do that. Also use different sizes of hooks, the stitches will change their look when you do this.\nWork slowly, although you can unravel the wire, it won\u2019t be as smooth anymore once it was shaped and you have to do it really carefully, the wire breaks easily. While you work on the project pull the rounds length ways and sideways. It will even out the stitches and you get a crisper look of the fabric created.", "title": "Wire Lampshade", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Wire-Lampshade/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "For thelamp shades\nArtistic wire (also called craft wire) 28 gauge, 0.3mm, try to get the spools with 70m (75yd) on it, you don\u2019t want to run out midway, choose the shiny rather than the mat finished wires (mine were called \u201cvivid\u201d violet for example)\nCrochet hook (metal, to avoid scratches on hooks), I used a 6mm for the cylinder and a 5mm for the cone shape\nWire cutters, but you can also use craft scissors\nBig eyed needle\nTo make the lamp\nSwitched metal lamp holder\nFabric covered 3-core cable (or 2-core for some countries), measure the length you will need\nCable stripper and small screwdriver\n3-pin plug (or 2-pin plug)\nBulb \u2013 make sure it\u2019s compatible with the lamp holder (screw or bayonet)\nScrew hooks for hanging the light from the ceiling", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUJ/P471/IVO3BX1T/FUJP471IVO3BX1T.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: What You Will Need"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The stitches I used are single crochet and half double crochet.\nHalf double crochet begins like a double crochet until there are three loops on the hook.

They get piled up for months or sometimes years and even small projects like making little thing (keyrings, bookmarks, bracelets, etc) don't help to clear the space out.\nWell, here is a fun project for you to utilize those pieces of leather. It will make your leather work almost waste free and help you with the ideas when you are looking for a great gift for your family or friends or even an item for sale!\nIf you are not a leatherworker and do not have a box of leather pieces staring at you from the corner of your room you still can make this rug. There is always plenty of old leather items from gloves to handbags to bags, jackets, boots and lots of other things which you can use to get your leather pieces from. Old leather furniture which is not usable any more is perfect, too. Ask your relatives, friends and neighbours if they have anything old made of leather that they can part with. And of course, there is such thing as internet where you can always get great deals on leather offcuts and remnants!\nI work with vegetable tanned leather and I dye and finish it myself. Vegetable tanned natural leather gives an option of stamping and tooling. Chrome tanned leather comes already colored and finished and unless it comes with a pattern on it you can not stamp it yourself.\nThis is fully hand stitched project and I would recommend you not to use the machine (even if you have one for leather work). First, it will be too big to stitch with a machine. Second, if you are planning to use it as a cover for an armchair or a sofa or as an actual rug on the floor you want the stitches to be as strong as possible. Sewing machine does a good job and it will do it with a lightning speed of course, no arguments about it. But if you want something special and long lasting nothing can beat saddle stitching. Even if one or two stitches get torn (for whatever reason) the seam will stay strong and will be holding the leather like nothing happened. If a machine made stitch is broken the whole seam line gets loose and the pieces fall apart (well, that is if they are not glued together). So yes I would recommend the saddle stitching by hand but I should mention that it is a tedious work and you will need a lot of patience. Believe me, it will be worth it.\nThis rug can be a great space saver if hanged on the wall. Add a few extra pieces of leather (large ones) on the top of a finished rug, stitch them to the rug on three sides and there you have pockets for shoes, keys, gloves, slippers, shopping bags, etc. Hung it on the wall near the door using strong hooks (make a few loops stitched to the rug). This leather is strong and will hold a lot of weight. Extremely handy for students or in small apartments as it will save a lot of space. You can make it in custom shape and size and the pockets can be also custom sized accordingly to the things you want to place in them. Near the door it can be shoes and gloves, placed on the wall in a bedroom it can be a holder for pyjamas or towels or hair brushes or head phones or just anything else that clutters a room, especially a student's room. Notebooks, pens and pencils, phone charger cables, DVDs, even a can of soda to keep nearby when needed. Everything can go on the wall into pockets of this rug and it looks cool and presentable. You can cut symmetrical pieces and stitch them in some geometrical order, you can color pieces in bright colors or even don't color at all and let the time create a patina which will be just like natural antique.\nMake really strong hooks and leather itself will take care of the weight of the items in the pockets..\nSo here it is, the Leather Rug aka Space Saver.", "title": "Leather Rug", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Leather-Rug/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "~ Leather offcuts (the larger the better because small pieces means more work)\n~ Leather knife (rotary knife is what I am using)\n~ Leather antique dye (if you are using vegetable tanned leather offcuts)\n~ Leather finish\n~ Stamping tools (if you are using vegetable tanned leather)\n~ Leathercraft cement\n~ Stitching needles x2, Waxed polyester thread 1mm\n~ Pricking irons or stitching punches\n~ Stitching pony/clamp\nIf you are using chrome leather you do not need any coloring stuff as chrome leather is already dyed and finished.

Left needle goes through the first hole and the right needle goes through the same hole to the opposite side. First stitch is done. Then again, left (used to be right) needle goes through the second hole to the right and the right needle (used to be left) goes to the opposite side through the same hole. Tighten the second stitch.

Then I carefully centered the bandanna over the crochet block and estimated where the pocket could be for the front of the block. When I achieved the look that I wanted, I pressed to creased the flap and pocket fabric and pinned it into place and stitched it on both edges as shown, being careful not to sew the back side while stitching it.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FYX/5U0D/IVHQITFI/FYX5U0DIVHQITFI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCY/IBTO/IVHQJMOY/FCYIBTOIVHQJMOY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3B/ASVG/IVHQJMCE/F3BASVGIVHQJMCE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F80/INV6/IVHQJS56/F80INV6IVHQJS56.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHP/K487/IVHQJMR9/FHPK487IVHQJMR9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1L/D2LK/IVHQJND8/F1LD2LKIVHQJND8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTW/0G0F/IVHQITHM/FTW0G0FIVHQITHM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRN/NQ8Y/IVHQITHO/FRNNQ8YIVHQITHO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMY/9LZB/IVHQITHT/FMY9LZBIVHQITHT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2T/66ZR/IVHQKM91/F2T66ZRIVHQKM91.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG5/1DGW/IVHQITJ4/FG51DGWIVHQITJ4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2V/98M3/IVHQITK0/F2V98M3IVHQITK0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Pocket and Flap Hem"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Lay the pocket and flap over the crochet block and hand sew along the long edges leaving both short ends un-sewn.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0I/NBXA/IVHQITNL/F0INBXAIVHQITNL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FES/9KAD/IVHQITPF/FES9KADIVHQITPF.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Sew the Pocket and Flap to the Crochet Block"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Fold the Crochet block in half with the fold on the left side of the block.

I\u2019d like to share with you this project: A Viking inspired embroidery of Odin\u2019s horse Sleipnir. The horse is known to be really tough, fast as the wind and able to run in the air as well as on the ground. He was born by Loke, but that is a different story. ;) The most important thing about Sleipnir is that he is a horse with eight legs, which makes him so strong and fast. Usually he is a dark or black horse, but I decided to portray him in the darker brown colours.\nThis is a project that takes some time, but the embroidery is made with just one stitch, so the technique is not very complicated, and it only requires very few materials. In the end I used the piece to make my sewing-purse look cooler.\nMaterials:\n- Fabric (I used a dark brown wool)\n- Yarn, 2 \u2013 3 colours (I used woolen yarn)\n- Needle for embroidery\n- A pen to trace the outline of your embroidery\n- Scissors\nLet\u2019s get started!", "title": "Viking Embroidery: Sleipnir", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Viking-Embroidery-Sleipnir/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "First I took my white pencil and drew an outline. I choose to free-hand it, but if you feel more like using a stencil or find inspiration in pictures, there\u2019s a lot of google images of Sleipnir. My pencil wasn\u2019t so great, because it was easily erased when the fabric was touched a couple of times, the same as chalk would be. I changed it a bit, mostly the tail of the horse, so the pencil gave me a bit of freedom. However I recommend you use special paper for embroidery; that will give a better result and fewer frustrations. I would have done it, just didn\u2019t have any.\nMaking space for the 8 legs were quite difficult, but in the end it worked out. It can be a bit much to keep track of all of the legs and how to stitch them the best way, so don't rush this too much.\nNow you\u2019re set to start: I used a chain-stitch to outline the silhouette of the horse with white string.\nA chain stitch is made like this:\n1. Treat the needle and tie a knot on the end. Stick it though the fabric, so that the knot is on the back.\n2. Stick the needle trough the fabric close to where it came up in the previous step.

To do this, use a large serrated knife to cut a hole at the top of the pumpkin. You can also make the hole at the bottom of the pumpkin, or even at the back, depending on how you're going to light it. I chose to make the hole at the top to keep things simple.\nNext, scoop out the guts. You can do this which ever way you feel is most efficient. I mostly used my hands, but you may find it easier to use a large spoon. Either way, this step is pretty messy, so it's probably best to cover your work-space with newspapers or something to keep the mess contained.\nOnce all the guts have been removed, use your large spoon to scrape the inner walls of the pumpkin. This is done for several reasons: first, scraping off all the stringy parts will prevent mold from growing inside the pumpkin, so it lasts longer.Also, when the pumpkin walls are thin, it's easier to carve the pumpkin and the final result looks better, especially when you get to multiple layer stencils.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FM4/4W8W/IUOI9P20/FM44W8WIUOI9P20.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJM/HDPM/IV0ALJEK/FJMHDPMIV0ALJEK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: In Which the Author Lobotomizes a Pumpkin"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Once you've gutted your pumpkin, it's time to find a stencil. The stencil will be transferred onto the pumpkin to serve as a guide while you're carving.\nYou can easily find free pumpkin stencils online on various sites. The one I've used most frequently in the past is Pumpkin Glow, where you can find all sorts of patterns, from cartoon characters to movie villains. These templates are mostly in the beginner level, however, so once you've gotten some experience carving pumpkins, another website worth checking out is Stoneykins. Here, you'll find a wider variety of templates, from celebrities to animals to logos to famous music composers. Unfortunately, most of the stencils here cost money, but there are also some free ones on the site.\nHere are some more websites where you can find pumpkin stencils:\nOrange and black pumpkins\nHalloween Pumpkins\nPumpkin Craze\nSpook Master\nYou can choose any template you like, of course, but I ended up using a pattern from the Charlie Brown Halloween special, which you can find down below.

You've officially reached the last step before carving. That being said, take your time! This step is actually more difficult than it might seem at first.\nSo now that you have you're pattern printed out, you'll need to transfer it onto the pumpkin. To start, cut around the pattern so that it is just big enough to fit onto the pumpkin. Next, tape the pattern onto the pumpkin where you want it to go. I don't think the type of tape you use really matters; in the past, I've used both scotch tape and duct tape, and both have worked equally well. If you wanted to, you could even use push pins to hold the pattern in place.\nThe idea here is to use your needle to poke holes all around the edges of the design, so that when you remove the stencil, you get an outline of the pattern. You can then \"connect-the-dots\" with a sharpie to get a carbon copy of the original stencil on the face of the pumpkin.\nUnfortunately, this is easier said than done. Chances are, once you remove the stencil, you'll find yourself staring at a bunch of seemingly randomly-placed dots. The pattern I used was relatively simple, so I didn't really have this problem. Still, on more complex designs, the sheer number of dots can get overwhelming. For this reason, it's helpful to keep the stencil on the side as a guide to help you when you're connecting the dots.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDM/1OFR/IVCVVFQC/FDM1OFRIVCVVFQC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDJ/66RG/IUIZ2P32/FDJ66RGIUIZ2P32.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR8/1D6N/IUKEOEVP/FR81D6NIUKEOEVP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FM8/VBHE/IV0AOGHD/FM8VBHEIV0AOGHD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLY/FS6I/IV0ABFC7/FLYFS6IIV0ABFC7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Transferring Your Pattern Onto the Pumpkin"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Now that you've gotten all the boring preparation out of the way, it's finally time to get carving!\nIdeally, you'd want to have a pumpkin carving kit, which you could easily find at Lowes or Walmart for just a few bucks. However, I was short on time, so I had to improvise. Instead of using a traditional pumpkin carving saw, I used a jigsaw blade attached to a wine cork. I also used a drill along with a utility knife for the smaller details.\nWhen carving, you want to start from the center of the design and then work your way out. If you can, you should also focus on the smaller details first. If you don't follow these two tips, there's a much higher chance of the pumpkin breaking as you're carving.\nOn my pumpkin, I first started by drilling out the eyes, then cutting out the details of the face, like the eyebrows and mouth.

If you're feeling bold, you could also try lighting it up with fire. There are several tutorials around the web which show you how to do this, most of which involve toilet paper soaked in kerosene.\nOnce it's lit, take a step back and gaze upon its beauty! What might not look like much at first will suddenly come to life when lit. If you made any mistakes while carving, you can probably spot them now and fix them.

I decided to try knitting some, even though I was intimidated.\nI soon realized that, although colorwork looks complex, it is made with only knit stitches.\nI made these snowman mittens as a special gift for my friend.\nThe steps will cover everything you need to know to make them, except the very basics of knitting, like how to cast on, how to knit, and how to purl.\nColorwork mittens are knitted in the round, and I will explain how to do that. (I use less needles for this than most people, because mittens are small and I don't like needle ends poking out everywhere).\nMaterials:\nDK weight yarn in two contrasting colors. (if you don't have this weight, you can also use fingering (sock) weight by holding two strands of yarn together for each color (DK is double the thickness of fingering). Wool yarn works best for colorwork, but any fiber will do. I used yarn that I found locally, but a very similar tonal yarn, in similar colors, is Valley Yarns Valley Superwash DK Hand-Dyed by the Kangaroo Dyer in colorways dutch tile and inky fingers. One ball of each color will be plenty.\nFor a lower priced, solid color option, Valley Yarns Valley Superwash DK would work well, in colorways boy blue and navy. You will need to buy 2 balls of the Navy, and may want to get two balls of boy blue as well, because these balls are only 137 yards. I used 140 yards of navy and 132 yards of blue for my pair of mittens.\nDouble pointed knitting needles in size US 2 (2.75mm) You may need a different size, depending on how tightly you knit. (I'll cover that in step 2). You can get these online here, or at your local Walmart or craft store.\nTapestry needle, for running in yarn ends. I got mine at Walmart.\nA few pieces of scrap yarn for holding stitches. You can use stitch holders if you have them, but I just use yarn.\nMeasuring tape.\nA wire coat hanger (optional).\nIf you'd like a more traditional pattern for these, rather than a step by step, you can download my pattern pdf here.", "title": "Snowman Mittens With Braids", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Snowman-Mittens-With-Braids/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "You will need to know the size of your hand, so that you know how big to make the mittens. Most patterns will list the size according to hand circumference. A medium sized adult hand is about 7.5\" around.\nI find it's comfortable to have my mitten be the same size as or, for looser mittens, half an inch bigger around than my hand.\nTo figure out how big your mittens will be, you need to know how many stitches there are per inch of your knitting. This is called gauge, and it will be different for everyone. If you are following a pattern, it will list the gauge that you should try to get for the pattern.\nIn order to figure out your gauge, knit a small amount of the colorwork in the pattern (read steps 3-5 first, so that you know how to knit colorwork) and then measure how many stitches per inch you are getting. This is called a swatch. If you are getting too many stitches per inch, then change to larger needles and measure again, if too few stitches per inch, then change to smaller needles. Knitting at the same gauge as the pattern will make sure that your mittens come out to same size as those in the pattern.\nI'm lazy and don't like to swatch, so I usually just begin with the needle size recommended in the pattern and hope for the best. Once I have a bit of the colorwork done, then I measure my gauge. If it is close enough, then I've already got some of my mitten done and can continue. If it's too far off, then I consider what I've knitted so far to be a swatch and try again on different sized needles.\nThe gauge for these snowman mittens is 8 stitches and 8 rows per inch.\nI made the snowman mittens 60 stitches around, so that the mitten will be 7.5\" around. (60 / 8 = 7.5)\nIf you wanted the mitten to be 8\" around, then you should knit it at a gauge of 7.5 stitches per inch, because 60 stitches divided by 7.5 in an inch equals 8 inches. (If you need smaller mittens, then you could try a smaller needle, but that might make it difficult to work with the thick yarn. In that case, it would be a good idea to see how many stitches per inch you could get with sock yarn.)", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBL/XSWZ/IVCVUC4A/FBLXSWZIVCVUC4A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FER/6ZGY/IVCVUC0C/FER6ZGYIVCVUC0C.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Sizing the Mittens"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Cast on a total of 56 stitches in the lighter color.

Now there should be 28 on each needle.\nThe two needles will be connected to each other by the cast on stitches. Bring together the two ends that are not connected.\nMake sure that the ridge that the stitches make on one side of the needle is straight along both needles, because you are about to join the stitches into a circle, and if they are twisted, then there will be trouble later.\nUse a third double pointed needle to knit, beginning where you started your cast-on. The work will now be joined on both sides.\nWhen you get to the end of the first needle, use the now empty needle in your hand to knit the stitches on the second needle.

You will notice that when you do not use a color for several stitches in a row, when you use it again, there will be a strand of yarn on the inside of the mitten, where you carried the yarn across the stitches of the other color this is called a float. This is normal. Try not to pull your stitches too tight, because this can cause the fabric to pucker.\nIf there are more than 5 consecutive stitches of a single color, then it's a good idea to twist the two yarn strands around each other so that there's not a really long float on the inside of the mitten that can get caught on your fingers. Try not to twist the yarns in the same place on adjacent rounds, because this can cause little dots of one color to show up in sections that should be solidly in the opposite color. You can tell where you twisted it on a previous round by looking between the stitches. If you twisted the yarn between those stitches on the previous round, you will be able to see both yarn colors between the stitches.

Then insert the needle that the stitches were on before you slipped them, into the two slipped stitches, purlwise, and knit them.\nThe second decrease is easier.

This will help your ends stay together.\nPlace marker to mark beginning of row.\n\n2. Knit as follows for first 10 rows: Odd Rows 1\u20149 knit\nEven Rows 2\u201410 Purl\nWhen knitting in the round, this forms garter stitch. You should have 5 \u201cridges\u201d of garter stitch. This will be the base, or \u201cfloor\u201d of your bag. Garter stitch felts denser than stockinette.\n\n3. Continue knitting in the knit stitch until bag measures 14\u201d from the beginning cast on edge.\n\n4. Dividing for flap: From marker, knit 44 stitches. Place Marker. You should have set of 44 stitches and a set of 48 stitches. The 44 stitches will be for the front of the bag, and the 48 stitches will be for the flap. Knit around over the next 48 stitches to your first marker. You should have 44 stitches by your left hand, and 48 by your right.\n\n5. I-Cord Bindoff: Cast on 4 stitches on your left needle using the knitted cast on or cable cast on. I like using a crochet hook to put my stitches on the left needle. Use whatever size crochet hook that will grasp your yarn easily. Take the yarn from your right hand over to your left, insert crochet hook between first two stitches on left hand needle. Pull yarn loop through from back to front, and place loop on left needle for new stitch.\n\n6. Knit 3 stitches from left needle to right. Knit the 4th stitch that you added TOGETHER with the first stitch from the bag itself. TRANSFER 4 stitches from the right hand needle back to the left needle.

Illustrations will show with Knot. If the gap is tight, loosen it enough to push the strap through.\n\n2. Tie a LOOSE over hand knot about 2 1/2\u201d in diameter. Leave a tail of I cord sticking out so that it can be tacked over the edge, then tucked under and sew to the bag.\n\n3. Thread yarn tails of I cord through darning needle and use to sew knot to bag. Sew around knot, through the knot to the inside of the handbag, around the outside, so that it lays even to the bag, and does not tilt. Add extra yarn if necessary. HOWEVER, do not make knot TOO rigid. Tack down all around knot so it will sit evenly, and that center of knot will not become undone. The knot should still feel \" Smooshy\".

Ever accidentally shrink your favorite sweater by washing it? That's felting. Technically, taking a knitted item and shrinking it into felt is called fulling. But for the sake of simplicity, we will continue to use the term felting. Soap and hot water open up the scales of the wool fibers while the agitation of your washer forces those fibers to stick to allow them to shrink. Different brands of yarn combinations of yarn will cause your project to felt to a different size. So, DO NOT CHANGE YARN BRANDS in the middle of your project. Lighter colors do not felt as well as darker. Some white yarns do not felt at all because the scales have been removed in the bleaching process. Also, knitted objects do not felt in the same ratio from top to bottom as they do side to side. Generally, an object will shrink 30% - 40% in height and 20 - 30% in width depending on fiber content and gauge knitted. Of course, water temperatures, agitation, amount of time allowed to felt are all added variables too. But then, this is art!\n\nSo let's go!\n\n1. Grab a pair of jeans you don't care aboutto use for washing in hot water. Place your bag in a large zippered mesh bag or zippered pillowcase. The mesh bag should have enough room for the knitted bag to move around in it. If the mesh bag or pillowcase compresses the item you are felting, it could cause the sides if the bag to felt to itself. Using a mesh bag is important as it will help prevent loose fibers from escaping into your washer. The bag also prevents the strap from wrapping itself around the agitator of your washer.\n\n2. Put your jeans and bag in the washer. Add a tablespoon of detergent, or my personal choice is Dr Bronner's Natural Hemp Soap. Set your washer on its medium high load setting, highest temperature and heaviest agitation setting then start! You will want to check the progress after 10 minutes to see how your bag is felting. If it is a tight fit in the mesh bag/pillowcase, take it out and check to make sure it is not felting to itself. Reposition the bag back in the mesh bag and resume washing.\n\n3. Check again after another 10 minutes. It usually takes about 30 - 40 minutes to felt a handbag of this size, depending on the agitation and temperature of your hot water.\n\n4. The felting is finished when the fabric is a consistent texture and there are no gaps or holes in the knit. You should not be able to see the lines of knitting all that well or see through the knit. The fabric should be firm and dense. Do not let your bag go through the spin cycle. Spinning the bag can potentially crease the felted fabric.\n\n5.Take your bag to the sink and rinse first with cool then cold water. Work your way around the bag, inside and outside to throughly rinse the soap out of the bag. Cold water also shocks the fibers and helps to lock the fibers and firm up the felt.\n\n6.Gently squeeze out the excess water. roll in towels to soak up moisture.\n\n7.Stuff with plastic bags or a box if you have one the right size to block into shape.\n\n8.When dry, steam press flap. Go over bag with a razor to trim any stray fibers or fuzzies.\n\nAdd a magnetic clasp to the flap and front, decorate with antique buttons, silk or ribbon flowers, needle felt details...Your bag is a canvas for more creativity!\n\nEnjoy your new handbag!\n\nIt's easy to make a custom lining for a box bottomed bag.

(Refer to the images which show this step for 9 stitches.) This gives you 2 rows of stitches on 2 needles.... that are crucially joined in the middle. This is the very bottom of the pocket and stops things falling out.\nKnit 30 rotations (rows over both needles) in the main colour. You should now have something that resembles a pocket. Congratulate yourself on being awesome, as I usually do at this point. Keep the knitting on the double pointed needles at this point, just as things are about to get a little tricky to create the space to put the pocket zip in.\nChange to yellow, and knit 2 rotations.\nChange back to red, and knit 2 rotations.\nChange back to yellow and knit 1 full rotation. Then follow the next instructions carefully. You are going to create an opening to sew a zip into at the end.\nZIP ROW: Knit 4. Cast off the next 22 stitches. Cast on 23 stitches. Slip the 4 stitch from the start of the row from the right hand to the left hand needle. Pass the 23rd cast on stitch over the slipped stitch, this anchors the opening into the scarf. Knit to the end of the row. Knit the second needle normally.\nChange to red. Knit 4 rotations\nPOCKET CLOSURE ROW: Now, holding both needles in your left hand, use the 3rd needle for a 3 needle bind off technique, but without actually binding off... just knit the 2 together, one from each needle. Knit one stitch from each needle together onto the 3rd needle. This will close the pocket you created at the top.\nAt the end of the row, pick up your circular needle.

I've started carving pumpkins about 14 years ago. Each year since then I normally decide on a theme for my pumpkins and carve at least two pumpkins, sometimes three. Over the years, I've learned some tips & tricks to both speed up the carvings and to get a better finished product. I also try to come up with ways to think outside the pumpkin to add a more 3D aspect to the carving, or to add embellishments such as jewelled eyes or even electronic innards based on Arduino or Raspberry Pi projects to give the finished display more of a wow factor.\nI just wanted to pass along some of my tips and techniques developed over the years to others that may be wondering how to create these types of pumpkin carvings. With video instructions and tips, I'll even take you through a beginner level project, based on the lovable Instructable character, showing techniques I use in all my carvings. This video instructed project will take between 1 to 2 hours to complete.\nI specifically used the term \"backlit\" pumpkin carvings, because there is a big and fundamental difference between traditional relief carvings and carving for a backlit medium such as a pumpkin.\nThe first non lit pumpkin picture above is one of the first pumpkins I carved (a project from the book Extreme Pumpkin Carving) as an example of a traditional relief carving done on a pumpkin. You can add a more 3D look to any carving by creating darker looking regions which appear to be set back and lighter regions coming forward. In the first example above you can see that I carved the inside of the mouth deeper to give it depth with the dark shadowed area. This pumpkin looks better when not lit from behind. Now lets switch to a backlit carving like the dead pirate carving next to it.\nIn this carving I still use the same light and dark shading in the mouth for depth, but it is done in reverse. The dark area is not carved at all while the teeth are carved all the way through to make them as bright as possible. In this instructable I'll be concentrating on the backlit style of carving, as personally I feel it gives some of the best effects and is displayed in the traditional method of a lit pumpkin on a dark Halloween night.\nI hope you enjoy this instructable and that it either inspires you to step up your pumpkin carving or even to start carving your first pumpkin.", "title": "How to Carve Backlit Pumpkins.", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Carve-Backlit-Pumpkins-With-Extra-Wow-Facto/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "For the pumpkin selection process, I normally try to decide what design I wish to carve first, and then look for pumpkins to fit the bill. For example the angry birds above needed short and wide pumpkins, where as the minions needed both short and tall pumpkins. This year I even carved a baseball sized pumpkin since I needed to carve... well a baseball.\nAlso if you decide you want something other than a standard orange pumpkin, I suggest trying a white pumpkin. While the flesh is yellow and not white like the skin, it still works better when lit with a coloured light bulb such as with my green alien zombie pumpkin above. Other than that they are very similar to carve.\nTIP: I recommend buying locally grown pumpkins if you can. I live in a big city, and find that the pumpkins which get delivered to the big name stores more than a month before Halloween have a much thinner body. This makes them harder to carve, and they are often getting very soft by the time Halloween rolls around. Plus if you have kids you can make a day of visiting a farm and get them involved in the selection process, not to mention you are supporting your local farmer.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFR/NDCL/IV0ANRNU/FFRNDCLIV0ANRNU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYV/YEHO/IV0ANQ82/FYVYEHOIV0ANQ82.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS5/4FZN/IV0APMBK/FS54FZNIV0APMBK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAL/QVGG/IV0ANQ89/FALQVGGIV0ANQ89.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP9/39W7/IV0ANRL1/FP939W7IV0ANRL1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Q/FQVM/IV0AP48M/F8QFQVMIV0AP48M.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Selecting a Pumpkin"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The tools you use will be a personal preference, whether you rather use just knifes, small saws or chisels, you will need to be able to carve off layers of pumpkin flesh to create varying shades of light and dark. My preference is to use chisels.\nBelow is the list of tools I use during my carvings:\nKitchen knife and spoons.\nUsed for cutting a section of pumpkin off so that the pumpkin guts can be scrapped out with a spoon.\nPush pin.\nThis can be used for transferring a pattern onto the pumpkin by poking holes through the paper pattern at close intervals to outline the areas you need to carve.\nNails and / or drill bits.\nUseful for poking holes through the pumpkin where you need to let light shine through pin holes, or larger holes such as for eye pupils.\nSet of carving chisels.\nI am a bit of a traditionalist and a fan of wood carving, so I do the majority of my carving with a set of wood carving chisels. When they are nice and sharp, they make quick work of removing large amounts of pumpkin flesh. Primarily I use the flat chisel followed by the round gouge and V shaped parting chisels.\nX-ACTO knife\nUseful for cutting a fine line along the edge of the area you are chiseling out. You can then use the chisel to cut up to the point of the incision you made with the knife. Also useful for cutting the outline of letters if adding text. With the sharpness of an x-acto blade you require very little pressure to cut through the pumpkin. This can be important in regions which have become flimsy due to the thinness of the area being carved.\nSmall 4.5 mm parting chisel and gouge from this detail carving tool set.\nTwo of my most used tools, these small chisels are very useful for cutting/sketching the outline of the pattern, or for adding fine detail lines into the pumpkin skin.The small round gouge is also useful for poking small holes through the pumpkin.\nMiniature chisels\nThis set of miniature chisels are great for poking narrowly carved areas deep into the pumpkin flesh. You can also use them to scrape flesh away in hard to reach areas such as small recesses where the larger tools will not fit.\nDremel rotary tool\nThe Dremel is great for carving small detail into the pumpkin skin, or for lightly removing a thin layer when you just want to slightly lighten a non-carved area. Again it also allows you to carve without applying too much pressure which could damage the area you are carving.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLB/D8TA/IV0AO4EG/FLBD8TAIV0AO4EG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXF/YZNA/IV0APYQ9/FXFYZNAIV0APYQ9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Tool Selection"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The grossest part of the job is always getting all the slimy innards out of the pumpkin. I use a combination of a spoon and a soup ladle to get the inside as clean as possible. You will want to get all the hanging bits out so that they are not lying directly on whatever lighting you install in your pumpkin.\nWhere I cut the opening in the pumpkin depends on the design I am carving. Normally though for most designs I will cut the top off to get rid of the stem (unless there is use for it as part of the design), and I turn the pumpkin up side down so that the hole is facing down. I can then sit that hole over the light bulb I am using to light the pumpkin.\nIn some cases such as with the carving of Smaug the dragon above, I sliced one whole side off so that the pumpkin would sit flat on it's long side. This gave me the surface I needed to carve the long head of a dragon.\nAlso note that this step can be performed at various stages in the pumpkin carving, usually before the bulk of the carving is done. You will want to light the pumpkin before you finish to see what it looks like when back lit.\nNOTE: This step is covered by the Instructional Video 3 - Carving the details.\nTIP: If the pumpkin will not be displayed at head level, you can slice the section of pumpkin off at an angle. Doing this will tilt the carved surface up towards the person looking at it. An example is given in the video.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRR/0TPH/IV0ANRMG/FRR0TPHIV0ANRMG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Gutting the Pumpkin"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Once you have decided on the design you wish to transfer onto your pumpkin, you can follow the steps below to make the design easier to carve.\n1. Adjusting the image: You can use a photo editor on a computer to remove all colour from the design and to adjust the contrast to make the varying shades of lights and darks stand out better. This will allow you to outline the areas that will need to be carved, and the areas to leave the skin on.\n2. Printing the pattern: Measure your pumpkin and resize the image so that it covers the side of your pumpkin and then print it out on a printer. You can trim the excess paper off from the pattern to make it easier to attach to the pumpkin.\n3. Positioning the pattern: Find a position on the pumpkin where the design best fits. Remember, if you are going to cut the stem off and flip the pumpkin over, you need to place the pattern so that it will be right side up when flipped. Look for the least curved side of the pumpkin, being careful blemishes on the skin don't interfere with your finished carving. Though sometimes a blemish may even enhance the finished carving.\n4. Attaching the pattern: For the last 14 years I have always taped on the design and then used a pushpin to transfer the outline of the design onto the pumpkin. This year I tried gluing the design on with diluted white glue which worked easier, and I will likely stick with that. To do this just dilute some white craft glue with water in a glass cup or jar. Mix same amount of water and glue and brush it onto the back of your printed pattern. You can place it on the pumpkin and brush it on while pushing it down into all the creases in the skin. Don't worry if you end up with wrinkles in your pattern. This is normal when trying to lay a flat piece of paper onto a round surface.\nNOTE: Steps 3 & 4 are covered by the Instructional Video 1 - How to attach a pattern with glue.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F3V/35LQ/IVA4H3WR/F3V35LQIVA4H3WR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCT/VBA2/IVA4H3Y3/FCTVBA2IVA4H3Y3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4D/ICRG/IVA4H4YJ/F4DICRGIVA4H4YJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ3/O5LR/IV0ANQ8F/FZ3O5LRIV0ANQ8F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVW/A2W7/IV0ANRVS/FVWA2W7IV0ANRVS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2A/182M/IV0ANRYT/F2A182MIV0ANRYT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Getting Your Design Transferred to the Pumpkin"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "NOTE: This section is covered by theInstructional Video 2 - Initial carving and outlining.\nOnce you have the pattern attached to the pumpkin, it's time to transfer the outline. You have a couple of options, you can either use a pushpin to poke holes through the pattern at small intervals, or you can use a sharp knife such as an x-acto knife to trace around the pattern. You will want to trace out all the lines where there is a distinct difference between the light/dark shading. Don't worry too much about areas of fine detail within those areas.\nOnce the design is transferred, you will want to start by carving out the lightest sections first. In many cases this will be a matter of cutting those sections completely through to the inside and removing that section of pumpkin. That said you need to be careful that you do not cut a complete circle around an area leaving it unsupported. My rule of thumb is to always carve in order from lightest to darkest, and then add the final details.\nThe first photo above shows the initial carving stage with all the lightest areas cut out, and the second photo moving on to the less deeply carved areas.\nTIP: Try not too carve too much away as it can leave you with a flimsy pumpkin making it harder to carve the rest of the pattern. In some cases you may need to improvise on your pattern to leave bits of flesh in place to give an area more support. The third photo shows one of my first pumpkins I ever made, where I carved too much of the pumpkin away, leaving the design to be very flimsy almost to the point of collapse. As you can see it still looked OK when lit, however, if done again I would not carve nearly as much pumpkin away, and instead leave a thin layer of flesh in most of the bright areas.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FW2/24I8/IV0ANRNJ/FW224I8IV0ANRNJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRM/W79X/IV0ANRZB/FRMW79XIV0ANRZB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLG/7HBG/IV0ANROJ/FLG7HBGIV0ANROJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY8/6UVV/IV0AO390/FY86UVVIV0AO390.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Initial Carving and Outlining"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "NOTE: This section is covered by Instructional Video 3 - Carving the details.\nAs I've stated before it is best to work from the lightest areas to the darkest, thus you should first start by removing a layer of skin from the second lightest area of the pattern. Once you have the skin removed it is much easier to carve that section to a depth to give the appropriate lightness. If the area requires a gradient shading going from dark to light, you will need to carve the lighter side of the gradient to a deeper level, tapering up to the shallow darker side of the area. Mastering these gradients of light to dark will result in more realistic 3D effects in the finished carving.\nOnce all of the areas of the same lightness level are completed, repeat the process for the progressively darker regions.\nAs you start this stage of carving, it is good to be able to occasionally view your pumpkin lit from the inside to judge how it is going. Remember that your end goal is to have a pumpkin that looks great when back lit. Often with this type of carving, the pumpkin may not look very pretty when not lit, as you can not see the various light levels that make the final back lit carving look so three dimensional. Occasionally I will even do the carving with the room lights turned down and use the lit pumpkin to better judge where or how I need to carve.\nTIP: If you need to lighten an area, quite often it is easier to scrape away the flesh from the inside of the pumpkin behind your carving. This is a great time saver especially if the area contains some detailed carving you would other wise need to carve around.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHX/0131/IV0ANRSX/FHX0131IV0ANRSX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYL/ZVHL/IV0AO3AQ/FYLZVHLIV0AO3AQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKJ/R48O/IV0ANRME/FKJR48OIV0ANRME.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2U/WC8V/IV0ANSSM/F2UWC8VIV0ANSSM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Carving the Details, and Shading"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "To give the carving a more three dimensional look, I'll sometimes add a secondary pumpkin carving to the display as in these two examples.\nFor Gollum, I took the section of pumpkin that I cut off to gut it, laid my hand on it and traced the outline of my fingers. I carved the hand out and attached it to the base of the pumpkin as though Gollum was holding his hand out in front of him. Of course in his hand I set a golden ring.\nFor Halloween 2016, I went with a baseball theme. In carving the ball and glove above, I bought a mini baseball sized pumpkin and had my daughter draw a seam on it using a real baseball as a guide. I then used my Dremel rotary tool to carve a pattern of chevron symbols (>>>>) along the seam outline. Using the rotary tool for this made really quick work of it. I made an incision along both sides of the chevron pattern with an X-ACTO knife , and then used a flat chisel to remove a layer of skin in between the seams.

When you see the ring, it makes you immediately hear the words \"My Precious\" in your head.\nFor the dead pirate, I added a couple of plastic jewels for the eyes which I individually back lit with LED lights. I also added plastic jewels in some of the teeth.\nFor Smaug the dragon I used a couple of LED lights, a CPU fan salvaged from a dead laptop, an ultrasonic mist maker and an Arduino microcontroller to control the LEDs and fan. This was all housed inside the pumpkin. As seen in the video above, the Arduino would turn on the first LED to make the nostril glow red, and then activate the fan to blow the steam, AKA mist, out the dragon's nostril. Turning on the eye LED gave him the appearance of waking up. Smaug looked even better when I spread a bunch of chocolate coins in gold foil and other candy jewels around his head, as though he was laying on his mountain of treasure.\nFor the green alien zombie pumpkin I again used an Arduino to pulsate the LED lights in the eyes and flicker the red brain matter in the upper right.\nTIP: If you wish to add some freaky plastic eyes lit by LED's you can find a great assortment of coloured plastic light casings in Lego kits, if you happen to have any lying around.

However, as I originally created mine to be used on my scooter, it\u2019s sturdier than most: it has a bottom and it\u2019s felted. Felting strengthens the material and offers some degree of insulation. I designed it to hang from the scooter\u2019s purse hook so it would swing free as I rounded corners, preventing spilling.\nThe pattern included is for the large, grey cup. I include images of a smaller cup caddy I made for contrast and inspiration. Your caddy size will vary depending on the yarn and needles used. Please use the pattern as a guideline only and use your own best estimates to get the size caddy you want.\nSKILLS NEEDED\nCast on (your preference)\nKnit in the round\nPurl in the round\nIncrease (your preference) [inc]\nBind off (your preference)\nSeam two knit edges together\nSUPPLIES NEEDED\nDouble pointed needles (and perhaps a circular needle if the project gets too big for your DPNs).\nDarning needle\nAn example of the kind of cup you are knitting a caddy for. I used a large soda cup for the grey caddy.\nFinally, and most importantly, you will need approximately 200 yards of a worsted weight feltable yarn. Animal fibers \u2018felt\u2019 when the scales on the hairs relax and join with their neighbors. To test if a yarn is feltable, simply wet it and roll it about in your hands. If it fuzzes up and joins to itself, it has felted. Any wool that is not marked \u2018superwash\u2019 should do. Superwash yarn has been designed to not felt and so is not useful to us for this project.", "title": "Felted Cup Caddy", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Felted-Cup-Caddy/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Whether you have bought yarn specifically for this project or you\u2019re going through your stash, you will need to make a test swatch for your cup caddy to find out how much your yarn will shrink when you felt it. You can use any feltable yarn and any needle size for this project but you must use the same yarn and needles for the caddy as you use for the test swatch or your calculations will be off.\nUsing your chosen yarn and needles (I used Paton\u2019s worsted weight Classic Wool and number 6 bamboo double pointed needles), cast on stitches sufficient to equal four inches. Trial and error got me to 19 stitches. Use any cast on you like. Knit your test swatch until you have a four inch square. You may use any stitch you like but understand that felting will erase any stitch definition. I used stockinette with the grey caddy, and seed stitch with the green.\nFinish with any bind off you prefer. For ease later, trace around the swatch and mark the bind off edge so you can tell which way is up after you felt the sample. (It\u2019s better to use a physical marker like a non-felting yarn or a wool of a contrasting color than to use ink which may wash away. A few simple knots should be sufficient.) This is the time to note the stitch and needles used. I made two swatches to illustrate the difference felting makes but you needn\u2019t do that.\nTo felt your yarn, run it under hot water, soap it up and scrub it. The soap will remove the lanolin (a protective oil that coats each hair) and the scrubbing will encourage the fibers\u2019 scales to expand and catch at each other. I\u2019ve read you should shock the fibers by cycling through hot and cold water but I don\u2019t know if this is absolutely necessary. What you mostly need is an absence of lanolin and a great deal of agitation. So use lots of soap and scrubbing. As you start to agitate the square, it will stretch\u2014a LOT. That\u2019s fine. Just keep scrubbing, rolling, agitating and working that square. At some point the fabric will start to shrink and felt up. Keep working past this point to be sure it is fully felted.\nOnce you are satisfied it has felted, measure it against the tracing you made. How much has it shrunk? Line up the bind off edge of the sample with the tracing: did it shrink more in one direction than another? In my sample, the swatch has shrunk uniformly from 4\u201d square to 2.5\u201d. I used a little math to find I was left with 62.5% of my original square but you could also just eyeball it and see that it shrank to about two-thirds its original size. (If your swatch has not shrunk uniformly, try felting it again. It is unlikely that the shrinkage would be very uneven but if this happens, you can calculate accordingly, or try a different stitch or yarn.) This tells me that I will need to knit my caddy about a third larger than its final size.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGP/L0UL/IVA4PNH6/FGPL0ULIVA4PNH6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Make a Test Swatch"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Cast on 6 st, divide for working in the round, two stitches per needle.\nRounds 1 & 2: Knit each st with yarn doubled (I used the tail) 12 st on the first row, 24 st on the second.\nRound 3: Drop second strand of yarn, work in Stockinette stitch (St st).\nRound 4: Increase every other stitch. 36 st\nRound 5: St st\nRound 6: Inc every third stitch. 48 st\nRounds 7 & 8: St st\nRound 9: Inc every third stitch. 64 st\nRounds 10 \u2013 13: St st.

You want to knot your work there by making the next bar stitch over the yarn but not angling the needle to the next stitch just go straight across. (see pic) Slowly pull the needle through and you'll see a small loop forming, put your needle through that loop and then pull through. You have just made a small knot.

It is now neatly hidden inside your work.\n*You are nearing the end of the yarn, before working the end, you want to fold under the end about a 1/2\" or so. Hold with the left hand and continue working the bar stitches as usual. When you are at the end, push needle down the center of the end, angle the needle back to the side of the yarn at the previous stitch.

Steps with pictures including rough time estimates. The steps will be general, I'm not teaching how to weave, just the process of weaving a baby wrap. I'll list some great resources for learning how to weave.", "title": "How to Weave a Baby Wrap", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Weave-a-Baby-Wrap/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "First off...what do you need?\n-Weaving Loom- I bought a beautiful loom off Craigslist that came with yarn and all the accessories I could wish for. For a 4-shaft used loom common prices in my area range from $300 to $500. For more than 4-shafts, prices are generally from $1000 on up. In looking for a loom you want a floor loom that has at least a 32 inch weaving width (not the width of the loom, but the width of the area where you can weave). I've seen people ask about using Rigid Heddle looms, and from what I've read they aren't good for weaving wraps. A floor loom works well, just make sure it is wide enough. It's also a good idea to try a loom out before buying it, looms aren't one size fits all, and it's important to make sure you are comfortable while using it.\n-Weaving accessories-\n-Reed #10 or # 12 are commonly used for wraps, though other reeds can be used.\n-Heddles, you'll need to have enough heddles to make a wrap, depending on the number of ends per inch(epi) you use generally between 700 to 900 heddles.\n-Shuttle, a boat shuttle works great, though I'm sure you could use other kinds.\n-Reed hook/heddle threader.\n-Warping board or mill, some people make their own, or use other things for measuring yarn.\n-Bobbins and bobbin winder, some people use other things than a standard bobbin winder, like a drill.\n-Packing- thick paper or sticks that are wider than your warp and will be packed in between the layers of warp on your back beam. I use old city plans (my husband is an engineer), other weavers use packing paper, or screens.\n-Yarn- Common fibers used in wraps are: cotton, cottolin, Tencel\u00ae, wool, silk, and hemp. There are many other varieties, but those are most common. Common cotton yarn weights for weaving wraps range from 5/2 to 16/2. The most common yarn used and what most people start with is 8/2 or 10/2 cotton for warp and weft. So what do those numbers mean...the first number is related to the weight of the yarn, and the second number is the number of plys/single strands twisted together (some countries have these numbers switched, though usually this is how they appear). The lower the first number the heavier the strand of yarn, the higher the first number the lighter the strand of yarn. Generally speaking, lower numbers will result in a thicker wrap, higher numbers in a thinner wrap, though some of this also depends on weave structure and other factors. If you are using older yarn for your warp make sure to check it first to be sure it won't easily break. Check it by holding a length in your hands and tugging in opposite directions. If it breaks really easily it probably won't be good for warp.\nPlaces from which to buy yarn-\nThere are many different places to buy yarn. Some that have been recommended are the following: www.yarn.com\nwww.woolery.com\nhttp://www.handweaver.us/georgia_yarn_company.htm\nhttp://www.lonestarloomroom.com/\nhttp://www.yarnbarn-ks.com\nI've bought from WEBS (www.yarn.com) and love the yarn that I bought. They also have a great discount always available.\n-Time!? Lots and lots of time.\nLearn To Weave\n-If weaving classes are available in your area, awesome, take them! A good place to check is with local weaving guilds.\n-If weaving classes aren't available in your area, there are great options on the Internet.\nCraftsy has an awesome Floor Loom Weaving class that goes through the whole process of weaving. Here's the class: http://www.craftsy.com/class/floor-loom-weaving/1... It often goes on sale for $20. This craftsy class is how I learned to weave. I really like how you can go back and watch it whenever you want and skip to the parts you need a refresher on.\nElizabeth Wagner also has a set of videos on YouTube that go through the weaving process. Here's the link to her videos: https://www.youtube.com/c/elizziewag/videos\n-Other awesome resources: There are weaving Facebook groups, that I love, with so many kind weavers willing to answer questions and give help.\nWarped Wrappers (Baby wrap weaver group)- https://www.facebook.com/groups/warpedwrappers/\n4-Shaft Weaving- https://www.facebook.com/groups/4shaftweaving/\nBabywearing Weavers- https://www.facebook.com/groups/543972878967059/\nLearning to Weave by Deborah Chandler is a book that many recommend for learning to weave. Check your local library for it, or you can buy it online.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Supplies Needed"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Design- Colors and Pattern\n-Weaving structure- (the pattern) there are lots of drafts that work great for baby wraps. Easiest ones to start out with are plain weave, or a twill. There are lots of drafts to look at handweaving.net. There are also great books, I've used A Handweaver's Pattern Book by Marguerite Davison a lot. Different weaves bring about different wrapping qualities. Some are more textured, some more smooth, some more dense, others airier. Research to figure out what might work with your desired outcome. Drafts that work best for wraps are those that don't have super long floats. I try to not go to much over a length of 3 on my floats. Some weavers are fine with larger floats, but 3 is a good number around which to stay. Whether a certain size of float will work is also dependent on the weight of yarn you are using as well as structure.\n-Color- There are many different things you can do with the color, which is the great part about weaving your own wrap, you can organize the colors however you want! Some babywearers like having the two edges different colors because it makes it easier to find the right rail (edge) when wrapping. It does help to do a wrapping of possible color mixtures to get an idea of how they might look together. In the pictures are my wrappings.\n-Decide on sett, width and length- E-weaving has a great tool for finding a good starting point for sett (how many warp ends per inch) here http://e-weaving.com/Ashenhurst.html Setts vary in wrap weaving depending on the yarn used, the weaving structure used, and the density you want. Some common setts for 8/2 cotton yarn are 20 epi for plain weave, and 24 epi for twill. The best thing to do is to find a good starting sett, then weave a sample piece to determine if that density is what you want, then adjust from there. Common width for a wrap is in between 25 to 30 inches finished (so wider in the reed). The length for your wrap depends on what size wrap you want. Add on extra length for sampling, loom waste, shrinkage, and hemming when calculating how long your warp will be, and how much yarn you will need. Choose weft yarn (the yarn that goes back and for and is woven into the warp). Make sure you have the right amount of yarn for your project. E-weaving has a great calculator for calculating the amount of yarn you will need for both warp and weft here: http://e-weaving.com/MoALive.html .\nHere are some of my planning calculations:\nI chose to weave my warp in 8/2 cotton in a 4 color grad, yellow to pink to blue to peach. Mathematically I figured out what number of ends of each color would make for an equal grad. The pattern I chose was Goose Eye from Davidson's book page 22. My warp ended up calculating to 31.5 inches wide in the reed with a 24 epi totaling 756 ends total.\nTime I spent planning- a lot!!! I didn't track this time because I spent time planning while I did other things, like while doing the dishes, while nursing, etc. Depending on what you want to do with your design, it can take a little to a lot of time.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FP2/FKOS/IV0BOSU2/FP2FKOSIV0BOSU2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCY/18IJ/IV0BOSU5/FCY18IJIV0BOSU5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKN/5WYQ/IV0BOSW7/FKN5WYQIV0BOSW7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Planning"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "-Wind your warp- This is where you measure your yarn to all be the same length, then put it into chains to later be put onto your loom.

It takes time, dedication, and patience. There are so many tips and tricks out there for making amazing, mind-blowing, or even just insane pumpkin designs...but there's not too many directions focused on casting shadows with carved pumpkins.\nCasting shadows is when you use the back of the pumpkin (in addition to the front design) to add an additional element to the scene. By creating a design on the back also, you now have your lit-up front, and a shadow cast on the wall behind the pumpkin (from the back design). Though it sounds simple enough, there's actually important tips and tricks one must know to get the best results!\nSo let's dive into the art of casting shadows with my take on Jonah VS The Whale...\nBLUB....Blub....blub....", "title": "Casting Shadows W/ Carved Pumpkins (BONUS: Patterns Included!)", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Casting-Shadows-W-Carved-Pumpkins-BONUS-Patterns-I/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "There aren't any special tools needed for carving the pumpkin.

Cut the \"lid\" off.\nTIP: Angle the knife inward so it creates a cone-shaped wedge. This will prevent your lid from falling off or falling in.\n2. Remove the goop. I prefer a metal spoon with a long handle to the little plastic scraper they give you in the kit. The choice is yours. :) Also, you can save the seeds for later (here are some delicious seed recipes: http://allrecipes.com/recipes/969/appetizers-and-s... ). You can also use the pumpkin goop for real, good-ol'-fashion, no-frills pumpkin pie (here's a sample recipe: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/13711/homemade-fresh-...)\n3. Wall thickness: When you are scraping the walls of the pumpkin (the inside), the area where the front design will go should be no more than 1\" thick. The area where the back design will go (the area that will cast the shadow) should be around 1/2\" thick. No need to try to get a ruler involved, just guesstimate. Too thin of walls will cause the pumpkin to dry up and get wrinkly. Too thick of walls will be too hard to carve and may lessen the amount of detail that can be seen when the pumpkin is lit.\nTIP: If you plan to use a candle, make sure you have plenty of airflow inside your pumpkin, and that there's plenty of space between the top of the flame and the lid (if you choose to still use a lid). \"Only you can prevent forest fires\" (lol)...in this case, pumpkin or house fires. ;)\nOptional Steps & TIPS:\nIf you want to preserve your pumpkin for up to a week longer (to lessen the rotting so your family and neighbors can actually SEE your labor-intensive pumpkin designs before they go bad), simply dunk your pumpkin in a tub of cold water mixed with a little (a very small amount--3 teaspoons or less) of unscented bleach. The bleach will keep mildew and mold from growing on the pumpkin for a longer period of time.\nIf you have a flimsy/soft pumpkin and want to carve intricate details, it's also a good practice to let your pumpkin sit in a tub of cold water overnight. This will firm up your pumpkin so it can handle the intricate details better. You can also soak it in cold water anytime it gets dry or wants to shrivel up.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9R/E1AS/IVA4H303/F9RE1ASIVA4H303.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG6/YGWH/IVA4H380/FG6YGWHIVA4H380.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Preparation"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "1.

Using a pin or needle, poke along the lines of the pattern where you will cut out. Make holes every millimeter or so. In areas that a large amount will be cut out, I like to use a lot of little holes to \"fill in\" that area.\n4. When you're finished, remove the pattern...but keep it next to you. It will be necessary to remembering which line of dots to cut out.\n5. Once the carving is done, use the little saws from the carving kit (or a toothpick) to clean up the insides of the cut areas. This will make it so the light can be seen through even the most intricate details of your design. I like to test the design by putting my cell phone (with its flashlight on) inside the pumpkin and shining it out of the cut areas to make sure they're nice and clean.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F56/CMLY/IVA4H9JR/F56CMLYIVA4H9JR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKE/21NV/IVA4H9KD/FKE21NVIVA4H9KD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FF6/JBDO/IVA4H9L0/FF6JBDOIVA4H9L0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3F/UF2S/IVA4H9LS/F3FUF2SIVA4H9LS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Let's Carve!"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Anywhere that becomes weak from cutting (for example: the eyes on the face, etc) will need stabilization.

Once you are satisfied with your carved pumpkin, and have cleaned up all the edges and open areas, add a light source to the middle. This can be a wax candle or a battery-operated LED candle. I find that tealight-sized candles work the best and provide the least threat of fire, etc. If you are worried about a fire hazard, make sure the tealight is in a glass tealight holder OR use a LED candle.\n1A: OPTIONAL--before adding the light source, if you want to decorate your pumpkin with paint, etc...do that now and allow to dry.\n2. To retain moisture in your carved pumpkin and, thus, make it last longer, simply add petroleum jelly to the raw, cut edges of the pumpkin. This will hold the moisture in for longer periods of time.\n3. Position your finished piece to your liking. Remember: the further away from the wall, the bigger the projected image gets (but it also gets duller too, so keep that in mind when positioning).\nTHE END. Happy casting!

The white places in each pattern are to CUT OUT. Leave the black places on your pumpkin (leave this as pumpkin flesh).\n2. Only use as much or as little detail as your specific pumpkin (shape, size, etc) allows. If you need to lessen the detail of the whale (for instance), then only use a few of the \"cut\" lines, and not the rest.\n3. Make sure you leave pumpkin places (uncut areas) in-between cut areas so the entire design doesn't fall out of the pumpkin.\n4. You can print the patterns and use them as-is (just make sure to adjust the size of each to accommodate your specific size of pumpkin and need). OR: you can put a piece of paper over the enlarged image on your computer screen and physically trace the \"cut\" lines on your paper.

For the design I made a copy of one of my son's drawings from when he was little - now he's 19.\nI make my silkscreens by using an old 3M machine that used to be used to make over-head projector documents. Nowadays it's used a lot in the tattoo industry to transfer designs to bodies - so they are not cheap. It's called a thermofax machine and basically it takes the carbon from a copy made on a copier and burns that carbon onto a mesh screen that is coated with plastic film. The plastic film is burned away where the carbon is present, and lets the ink or paint or in this case, dish washing detergent, pass through the mesh.\nSo, I make a drawing, or copy one of my son's, put it into the copier and put the copy of the drawing into the thermofax with some expensive mesh film and in less than 5 seconds I have a screen ready to put in a plastic frame and start printing.\nThermofax machines may be bought on ebay or from Welsh Products, but that is not what this 'ible is about - I'm only saying all of the above just in case you want to know.

It all depends on what colors were mixed to dye that particular fabric.\nDishwashing soap takes a lot longer to remove color than bleach, it will dry, you can stick it in a drawer and forget about it for a year, as I did a year ago, find it and and stick it in the washing machine and poof! color removed. Best part is the fabric's not damaged - even after prolonged forgetfulness.\nSo, wait until you like the level of color that has been removed and then be sure to wash it. I don't even add soap - after all you are using dishwashing detergent. This can take anywhere from minutes to hours, probably not a year. Once the dishwashing detergent has dried I doubt it is still working.\nUse an old towel under your fabric because you will always get better images when you have a soft surface.

You can do a nice and clean beveling but then it will look \"too perfect\" and too \"not believable\" :-)\nAnyway, this is completely up to you how you want it to look.\nUse a small matting stamp in the tight corners and a larger one in larger areas.\nOnce you are done use a modelling spoon to smooth out the edges a bit (like if the got smoothed out over the years of use).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTM/8N0B/IV0B60DT/FTM8N0BIV0B60DT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F34/BHGT/IV0B60DO/F34BHGTIV0B60DO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTZ/OU1Y/IV0B60FS/FTZOU1YIV0B60FS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQN/X757/IV0B60E3/FQNX757IV0B60E3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHP/Q9EQ/IV0B60E6/FHPQ9EQIV0B60E6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4X/WQBU/IV0B60E9/F4XWQBUIV0B60E9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F96/F6NI/IV0B60EC/F96F6NIIV0B60EC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUI/74X1/IV0B60EG/FUI74X1IV0B60EG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHP/DWBF/IV0B60EH/FHPDWBFIV0B60EH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV1/IP6L/IV0B60EP/FV1IP6LIV0B60EP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW9/5M1R/IV0B60ES/FW95M1RIV0B60ES.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGQ/JDTA/IV0B60EV/FGQJDTAIV0B60EV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW0/BC6K/IV0B60EY/FW0BC6KIV0B60EY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3P/DGX4/IV0B60F8/F3PDGX4IV0B60F8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGJ/P5IH/IV0B60FB/FGJP5IHIV0B60FB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8R/IFW4/IV0B60FL/F8RIFW4IV0B60FL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDD/6F6U/IV0B60FZ/FDD6F6UIV0B60FZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5Z/VOAG/IV0B60G6/F5ZVOAGIV0B60G6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Tooling"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Now the fun part starts!\nFirst we need to make our own mix.

The simplest chupas, traditionally, were just four poles attached to the corners of a sheet and held by members of the wedding party. Many people today use a similar style, but place the poles in buckets filled with ballast. I wanted my chupa to be freestanding though. I'd still have friends hold the corners for tradition, but I wouldn't need to worry about a fragile chupa falling apart in the midst of the ceremony (which I have seen happen). Additionally, this design doesn't require ballast and disassembles for easy transport. It's a humble design meant to be put together like Ikea furniture, and I'm very happy with it. If you're looking for something more extravagant, consider replacing the landscaping posts with birch branches, enlarging it to 5 feet instead of 4, or just decorating it with lights or flowers.\nThe basic steps are to drill holes in posts and affix cross beams with hexbolts, then brace the cross beams. The cloth covering is clipped on with binder clips stapled to the cross beams. I used two tallit, however any sheet of cloth works.\nBesides being useful for weddings this simple structure could be used in a garden, patio, garage or workshop as a style piece or as a simple frame from which to support projects while working.\nConstruction required only one person, although a second is helpful. I took me ~20 hours to build, but following this guide would probably take around 5 hours.

You could increase the lengths of the sides to 5' and make the interior space larger if you like, although for this instructable, I will describe how to build the chupa that I built with 4' sides.\nCut the four 8' beams in half.

I accidentally split the end off of one of the cross beams while putting things together early on before I'd made the braces and had to replace the cross beam. It happened because I put too much force on one of the ends of the cross beams while the posts were attached but the braces weren't.\nHaving a partner helps but isn't necessary. They key is to assemble the chupa in order and to attach things snugly so that nothing gets put under unnatural strain.\nBefore proceeding, I suggest attaching the braces to the cross beams first. This way, you only need to assemble one end of each brace while you're putting the chupa up, and you don't need to go looking for any braces or bolts while you're working. If you are annoyed that this means the braces swing around, tape them to the cross beams with masking tape.\nWith that done, go on with the assembly.\nFirst, attach one cross beam to two posts and brace it to them. Lay this piece flat with the cross beam underneath the posts. If you followed the previous step you may have just done this.\nSecond, attach cross beams to the sides of each of the two posts and let them lay flat at the sides of the posts. If your braces are already attached to the cross beam and you made angled ends to your braces, make sure to attach the beam so that the angle of the braces line up with the post. Again, this is purely aesthetic and does not affect assembly.\nThird, attach another post to each of the cross beams that are laying along the sides of the first two posts.\nFourth, attach a cross beam to the two newer posts.\nYou will now have a square lying flat on the ground, with all posts connected to two cross beams each.\nFifth, brace the cross beam that is on top, facing you to the two posts to which it is attached.\nSixth, gently and evenly lift the braced cross beam that is on top upward. The posts attached at each side should slide forward as you lift.\nSeven: Once the cross beams on the sides are at a 90 degree angle to two of the posts, brace the two side cross beams to these two posts.\nAt this point, there are only two corner joints that aren't braced. You can gently lift the cross bar on the bottom and stand the whole structure up. Remember that the joints should all be snug. They don't need to be very tight, but if they are wobbly, the structure will twist and one of the unbraced corners might break under the strain. If there isn't much wiggle, the structure will stand up easily on its own. You can then brace the remaining two corners.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FB4/3QRG/IUKEPL3O/FB43QRGIUKEPL3O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB3/KV84/IUKEPL68/FB3KV84IUKEPL68.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4X/XW5O/IV0B11U2/F4XXW5OIV0B11U2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIO/52BP/IUKEPL5X/FIO52BPIUKEPL5X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOB/COM2/IUKEPL5T/FOBCOM2IUKEPL5T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFQ/TURI/IUKEPL64/FFQTURIIUKEPL64.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG3/TSBG/IUKEPL3K/FG3TSBGIUKEPL3K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPB/06AO/IUKEPL5A/FPB06AOIUKEPL5A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSB/1I7Z/IUKEPL5J/FSB1I7ZIUKEPL5J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6I/PTI2/IUKEPL5F/F6IPTI2IUKEPL5F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJW/YQYC/IUKEPL5B/FJWYQYCIUKEPL5B.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD3/JXK2/IUKEPL7S/FD3JXK2IUKEPL7S.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Assemble"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "I forgot to take a picture.

We considered making a more viscous fake blood syrup but weren't sure if that would mist. If someone knows how to get the mist to change color I would really like to know.

The first plywood panel had the holes indented rather than punched all the way through to hold in the wood dowels. We started out with only four dowels so we could each have one hand apply pressure around each dowel. We laid down the glue, spread it out with some plastic putty knives, carefully aligned the holes and gently pressed down each sheet. This took us one full day of work.\nWe laid the glue over the whole surface of each sheet, but I had some leaks throughout the process and realized some of the glue that was deep in the center was unable to dry because it didn't have any air access. In the future I would only apply glue to the perimeter of each sheet to avoid this issue.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTG/UNMI/IUG0OQTV/FTGUNMIIUG0OQTV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRD/WHPZ/IUG0OQU2/FRDWHPZIUG0OQU2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCY/OZ53/IUG0OQU7/FCYOZ53IUG0OQU7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FND/56I1/IUG0OQUC/FND56I1IUG0OQUC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Gluing"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Once all the pieces are glued the shaping process begins. It took about 20 hours to fully sand down the foam to my liking. It is key to remember that this is simply the base layer and the build-up of layers can resolve any imperfections and create more voluptuous, smooth curves.\nAfter the foam is shaped and any dried glue is removed it is time to seal and putty the surface. Sealing is done by brushing on a modest layer of Epoxy on all surfaces. Next, once the Epoxy is relatively hardened the putty can be applied. The putty is created by mixing filler into the Epoxy until a thick, peanut-butter-like paste is achieved. This is smoothed on with a putty knife to fill any holes, blemishes, or create a smoother surface. If over 12 hours have passed between layers the Epoxy must be washed or \"scratched\" (by lightly sanding with a coarse sandpaper) to remove any excess catalyst which rises to the top and prevents optimal bonding between layers. If less than 12 hours have passed this step can be eliminated. This step is necessary between every layer from here on out.\nThe idea behind the booth is to have a fully sealed environment with clean air flowing in and filtered air flowing out. We used recycled 2x4's to build a simple frame structure and sealed it with a 3.5 mil plastic liner from Home Depot. We stapled it down with a thin strip of wood and a staple gun. The staple should first go through the wood and then the plastic and finally the 2x4; this creates a clamp between the wood and minimizes the chance of the staples stripping the plastic. We used two fans of the same size, one facing inwards and the other facing out, with a a filter in the same dimensions. We used the highest grade of filter from Home Depot to get the most efficiency and eliminated toxins from entering the space.

I bought all my epoxy, fiberglass and tools needed for this and the following few processes from Svendsen's Boatyard in Alameda. I tried out two different types of Epoxy: Hawk Epoxy and West System. I liked West System better because it was a finer consistency, easier to work with, and resulted in a smoother surface.\nI started out with the Slow curing formula which allows for 20-25 min pot life (before it begins to heat up) and 90-110 min working time (before it begins to gel). This is depicted in the last image which was taken from the West System website. It shows the four different hardeners and their respective pot life, working time, and curing time. If you are applying multiple layers it is easier to lie within the curing time, for slow it is 10-15 hours, between each layer. If you go past 12-15 hours you will get uncatalyzed catalyst which rises to the surface and creates a waxy layer that makes it more difficult for the next layer to adhere properly. This can either be rinsed off with soapy water or the whole surface can be lightly \"scratched\" with a coarse sandpaper to remove this film and allow for the best adhesion of the following surface. After mastering the process with the Slow formula I began using the Fast hardener to speed up my process.\nSealing the surface is relatively simple, you must get paint brushes with natural bristles (plastic ones will melt from the solvents in the epoxy). These are pretty cheap and have a limited lifespan, but to take care of them get a big bucket (from Svendsen's or Tap Plastics - to ensure it is made of a plastic that won't melt from the solvents) and fill it with lacquer thinner and dump the used brushes in here after each use to eliminate any epoxy sticking gunking them up. Once you are ready mix about 20 oz of epoxy (a larger quantity than most batches because this step goes quickly). Make sure to mix for a full minute and get the right ratio. West System and Hawk were both a 5 to 1 ratio of epoxy to catalyst. West System also sells pumps that dispense the exact ratio of 5 to 1 which can simplify the measuring process. If you want to lengthen the pot life of the epoxy it is helpful to get a metal pan with a plastic (make sure it is the right plastic) liner (also sold at Svendsen's) and pour the mixed epoxy into the pan. Spreading it thin will prevent it from prematurely heating up and gelling. Next grab a brush and paint the full surface. It should go on easily, the coat thickness should come naturally, not too thin where you are working hard to spread it, nor too thick where it is dripping. I also sealed all the Plywood pieces which weren't glued down to the foam (the remaining two sides and bottoms).\nOnce sealed the smoothing begins. The putty is made by fully mixing the epoxy and then adding a filler substance. I bought the West System 407 filler from Svendsen's. This was added slowly while mixing until a consistency of peanut butter is reached. This step takes more time and precision so smaller quantities should be made per batch. I found 5 oz to be just the right amount. This is spread on plastic putty knives and ideally covers the full surface until a smooth, even surface is reached. The plywood end plates were adhered using round gobs of this putty formula and drilled into the hardened sealed surface. The screws work as clamps would, and I also used alternative methods of clamping, to ensure the pieces would lie and cure as flat and air-tight as I could get them. For the bottoms I simply tipped over the piece onto a flat wood panel after adhering and screwing down the plates so it's own weight would secure the plywood. The tops I clamped in as shown in the images using small 2x4 pieces and clamping them within the wood-frame booth structure. After the epoxy had cured I removed the screws so they wouldn't jut out or create imperfections which were hard to sand down.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FU8/94WQ/IUKEUATI/FU894WQIUKEUATI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW9/H4RF/IUKEUAY3/FW9H4RFIUKEUAY3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ9/D16G/IUKEUB02/FJ9D16GIUKEUB02.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR8/XQBJ/IUKEUB04/FR8XQBJIUKEUB04.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRR/1IBR/IUKEUB1V/FRR1IBRIUKEUB1V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSJ/T64W/IUKEUB3L/FSJT64WIUKEUB3L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL2/O09R/IUYD33P3/FL2O09RIUYD33P3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Applying Epoxy and Putty"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "I bought two different grades of fiberglass, one was called e-glass it has a mat texture on one end and a fabric-like cloth on the other, the mat absorbs more resin, and is stronger in shear. I felt this would be helpful to build up the initial layers for thickness and strength. For the second layer I used a 10 oz cloth fiberglass. This is more flexible and absorbs less epoxy. It is helpful to set up a fiberglass station, as seen in the first image. I set it up using a metal tube clamped to two saw-horses. I put the fiberglass tube on this with a table underneath. I spread out a roll of paper on the table which I replaced periodically so as I was measuring the pieces I could keep the fiberglass untainted. If any epoxy touches the cloth it will harden and both create imperfections and prevent this segment from bonding to the previous layer.\nThe cloth should be measured and cut to fit the exact form while the piece is still dry so you can trim off excess without getting your tools and cloth all sticky. It is helpful to label each piece of cloth and where it should go with a sharpie and keep this stack in a clean area. As soon as epoxy touches the cloth it will begin to harden and if it isn't placed where you want it will go to waste. Any excess cloth that isn't cut to form will also harden and can be difficult to sand off, which is why it is good to plan everything out before beginning the epoxy process. Doubly curved surfaces will be difficult to form with one piece of cloth, so I created a puzzle of cloth pieces that form the full surface. Each piece of cloth should overlap with the one below it at least one inch to ensure adhesion. The corners are done last by cutting thin strips to accommodate for the curves (or thicker on straight edges) and overlapping each piece as you lay them down.\nOnce all the pieces are cut you must prep the surface (if over 12 hours have passed since the last coat of epoxy), then lightly paint on a coat of epoxy to wet the surface. Then carefully press the piece onto the surface and pat it down. Air bubbles will create deficiencies in the surface and adhesion so make sure to remove any air bubbles and press down the fabric from the center out to the edges. Then use epoxy rollers (sold at Svendsen's or Tap Plastics) to apply epoxy to the cloth until it is fully translucent. If you see any remaining white spots it is either not fully wetted with epoxy or there is a problem underneath (usually an air bubble).\nOnce cured you can sand between layers to ensure the smoothest form possible. It is most important to get any sharp edges off and remove any air bubbles or noticeable blemishes. The first layers are more about building up the surface to a certain thickness, I was shooting for 1/8\", and for a specific strength. I was aided by the fact that my mold was to remain within the piece, but I was able to reach 3 layers (considering the e-glass is two layers in one) which is strong enough to hold the weight of about 4-8 people (if not more).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FCW/2EF3/IUYD1ELN/FCW2EF3IUYD1ELN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNA/KHAX/IUYD1FFZ/FNAKHAXIUYD1FFZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC0/7FCX/IUYD1FIQ/FC07FCXIUYD1FIQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWU/OYUQ/IUYD1FDY/FWUOYUQIUYD1FDY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOX/PU2I/IUYD1E6W/FOXPU2IIUYD1E6W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA6/FDGC/IUYD1E7N/FA6FDGCIUYD1E7N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPM/P40K/IUYD2MM0/FPMP40KIUYD2MM0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Lay Up Fiberglass"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "The gelcoat is the last opportunity to smooth out and reach the form you are looking for. Due to my limited tools I applied the gel coat manually (rather than sprayed on). I mixed the epoxy with a substance called Aerosil until reaching a thick paste-y substance and spread this on with plastic putty knives. I coated the full surface about two or three times until I felt confident with the smoothness and form. In between each layer I carefully inspected the surface and marked it up with a sharpie to show where I saw low points and high points. Once the surface is wet and glossy it is harder to see these spots so the sharpie helps to speed up the process and ensure a higher precision.

I used Alexseal premium topcoats. I asked them to also smooth out the surface a bit further than I had because I knew their tools and staff were far higher quality and more professional than myself and my resources. They used four coats of heavy build primer with heavy duty orbital sanders to reach this ultimate smoothness. It takes 3 days for each coat of the final paint to reach its full hardness so it is important to account for this time. I didn't have time for a final clear coat which might have helped to protect the paint even more from scuffing and sharp objects scraping it. I feel it has endured a lot (I've brought it to five different events, each spanning anywhere from 1-3 days), and it is still in great shape. The gloss and vibrance of the color still remain a very professional quality, however it does show some wear and tear from buttons on pants and the many moves it's gone through.\nI also included 3/8\" neoprene footings to both raise the finished piece off the ground and prevent it from sliding around on the ground. I ordered these from Cal Neva Supply in San Leonardo, CA. They do custom die-cut shapes at a very reasonable cost.

I am slowly learning, and with this piece I took my time, and practiced the logos a few times.\nI'm a decent Photoshop hack, and after finding the logos--I think both ended up being from Wikipedia--using the magic wand, to select certain sections of each logo, I then used stroke to generate the borders between 3 and 5 pixel widths. *If anyone wants, I can add some screen shots of that as well.\nI cut a paper template exact to my final piece, and estimated how much 'framing' I wanted for the piece and determined the logos could be about 2\" high.\nThe image printing in Windows allows you to select the height of the image when printing, so that made things a bit easier.\nI was having a hard time trying to center the logos, so I cut out a cutout framed version of the template, centered it on the piece, then moved the logo into place.\nI dampened the leather piece, and using a stylus I copied the patterns onto the leather. I practiced on a few pieces to make sure everything would work well, I did notice on the North Star logo, that the lines were a bit too close, so I cheated a little bit and traced just outside and inside the respective \"N's\". On the final piece, I also did not trace the inside star, preferring to freehand it with my swivel tool.\nThe practicing of the logos was helpful as I determined the bit above about the North Star \"N\" and that the Wild logo was a bit more intricate, and at that 2\" size, probably more than I could pull off. So I omitted inner outline, as well as one of the zags across the ear / sun of the bear. I also figure it was easier to just do the downward angles of the trees, as the other portions where just too small of a detail to work with.\nWith the exception of the river / mouth, I used my small smooth-top beveler. For the river / mouth I used a patterend beveler to give it a little texture, I tried it on the practice piece and liked it. I contemplated on doing the same with the moon / ear, but I did not have the confidence I could pull it off.\nI used my edge groover to align the border on the three sides, and the groover for the borders along the handle's edge.

So if you are going to just make the Amiibo and not worry about the display box, skip this step!\nRemoving the plastic shell:\nStarting at one of the top corners, use your precision cutting object to cut around the entire glued edge.\nWhen doing this your goal is to not puncture the cardboard or plastic while still removing the smallest amount of the image printed on the cardboard.\nTo accomplish this, do not push down into the cardboard, but rather push your knife into the cavity where the amiibo resides and push it away from the card board slightly, effectively only allowing the blade, not the tip to touch the cardboard and plastic.\nWork your way around the edge, slowly with patience. There is no secret to this or magic formula, there will be parts that are better and parts that are worse, It will look great in the end, just don't rip the cardboard.\nWhen you get to the perforated part at the bottom edge, feel free to rip it off, we will replace it with tape later anyways\nIf you do it perfectly, the cardboard will be smooth with some of the colors missing and the shell will have a half a centimeter stripe on around the part that was glued of the picture.\nCleaning the Shell:\nTo clean the shell start by removing the Amiibo, support packaging, the anti-NFC piece of metal underneath the Amiibo, and the cardboard Amiibo piece in the bottom of the shell. (Save the cardboard Amiibo piece, but you can discard the support packaging and piece of metal foil.\nSoak the shell under warm/hot water for 10 minutes to 2 hours (depending on how easy you want the next step to be.)\nRemove the shell and use steel wool (or even a metal kitchen sponge) to remove the paint from the shell. It comes off pretty easy, you just need a little bit of elbow grease.\nDry the shell and you are good to go!\nCleaning the cardboard:\nUse your knife to cut around any places that the cardboard ripped and pulled up. Your goal is to make the cardboard as smooth and flat as possible, but don't go crazy, its going to get covered anyways.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: Freedom! - Remove the Amiibo From and Prepare the Packaging"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "For those of you who don't know NFC (Near Field Communication) is what makes your Amiibo more than just a really cool paper weight. Because it does not apply to this tutorial lets just say it works by invisible magic.\nThe NFC tag in your Amiibo is literally a sticker, you can rip it, and it will not work, and you will be sad. Keep this in mind.\nOpening the Amiibo:\nWork your way around the edge between the gold part of the base and the black part of the base with a pry tool (if you don't really care about the keeping the figure, just use a screwdriver and wedge it in there and apply appropriate force until things snap and release). If you do care about your amiibo, just be careful, more careful with an actual pry tool.\n***Note*** You will need to apply quite a bit of force to the figure once you wedge your pry tool into the unit. It will sound like you are breaking it, Don't worry you are just releasing the glue between the gold and black parts.\nRemoving and placing the tag:\nOnce the gold and black parts are separated you will see a white circular sticker on the black piece. This is the NFC tag, carefully peel it off (Don't use a screwdriver for this please, your fingernail should be enough).\nOnce you get the tag off the amiibo base, be sure to try it out on your Wii U or 3DS, to make sure you didn't break something.\nStick the tag to the gift card or hard plastic thing you chose (even cardboard would work).\nBe sure not to stick the tag to the black magnetic strip on the gift card, it wont break the amiibo, just will result in poorer performance.\nCut around the tag to make the gift card into a circular shape around the tag, I ended up leaving a 1mm gap around the tag, but that was to fit in the crochet work, as a base, so you may want to wait to cut this until you see how big your crocheted amiibo ends up being.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSA/7J4R/IUYD3H0W/FSA7J4RIUYD3H0W.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Destroy Everything! - Open the Amiibo and Prepare the NFC Tag (the Brain of the Amiibo)"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "To make this little guy, my wife followed the pattern below, which she got from this site - We are not taking credit for the crochet pattern.

Before doing so, if you haven't already, cut the gift card down the rest of the way to give your Charizard a nice, hard, flat bottom.\nStuff the body with the fluffy stuff.\nTest the NFC tag on your 3DS or Wii U to ensure everything is still working.\nPreparing the other elements:\nStuff all the other elements with the fluffy stuff.\nTo add the nails on the legs and arms, simply sew in the white yarn, to two adjacent indents in the crochet pattern. Then tie it off underneath\nTo add the nostrils to the snout, do the same but with black yarn and make the stitch a little bigger, that is two or three indents apart.\nAssembling the Top Half:\nSew on the two horn to the top back of the head. With the following note:\nCharizard has a very aerodynamic skull line that leads right into his horns. If you simply put the horns on the top of his head, they will look like ears and you will have a Charzocat... The horns should be made so they are angled when they sit flat. make sure they are angled back on his head - see the above image of the horns.\nSew on the snout about 2/3 of the way down the head to leave room for the eyes.\nAssembling the Bottom Half:\nThe first piece to sew on is the tail. Following the instructions from the above link, or using what ever method you prefer, sew on the tail with the following notes:\nAlong with the body and legs, the tail allows this guy to sit up straight you want to place the tail in a way that makes the body and the tail form a relatively flat foundation - see the above image of the profile view of the figure.\nThe oval belly goes on next to help center the other limbs\nAbout 2/3rds of the belly will be seen from the front, try to create the illusion that the rest of the belly follows the entirety of the tail.\nThe next piece should be the legs.\nLike the tail, the legs finish out the foundation so this guy sits up straight, so be sure to place them so the tail, body and legs, all are relatively flat.\nNext add the arms to the body, feel free to put them wherever you like.\nFinally add the wings in the direct center of Charizard's back.\nFeel free to pull the tail down a bit to get at the wings. You should not have to worry about pulling the tail out or misshaping it as this guy adjusts pretty easily.\nPutting it all together!!!\nFinally sew the two halves together!!!\nCheck the Amiibo on your Wii U or 3DS one last time!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXG/S7YX/IUG0WNQ3/FXGS7YXIUG0WNQ3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: It's Alive!!! - Sewing the Figurine Together and Adding the NFC Tag"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Design the Eyes\nFor this step, there is really no wrong way to do it.

Word also allows you to do this with photos, but so does Pixlr.\nI would suggest printing multiple of these (or just using the ones with the wrong coloration) to practice cutting on.\nTo cut the paper down to size I used a paper cut for the straight edges, a pair of scissors for the outside corners, and a hobby knife for the display hook hole.

You can do this either by drawing freehand or tracing over the images, but for something so detailed I find tracing to be best. I make the stencils using an iPad (you can also use a lightbox if you have one, but most people don't and they don't come cheap).\nFirst, block out the areas of light and dark onto the image itself. Then, install the free app filmScannerLite, which acts as a lightbox by illuminating the screen completely. Place your printed image with your lines on it and a sheet of blank paper on the iPad (I use a transparency sheet as a barrier so the pen doesn't bleed through to the iPad screen) and trace the image.\nTools:\nImage(s)\nBlank paper\nTransparency sheetPenTablet or lightbox", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNF/DJH4/IV0AABJB/FNFDJH4IV0AABJB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4Z/9G0V/IV0AAEUW/F4Z9G0VIV0AAEUW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLL/5CKR/IV0A9ZBF/FLL5CKRIV0A9ZBF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9I/OAQC/IV0A9ZBG/F9IOAQCIV0A9ZBG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Make Your Stencils"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Choose pumpkins that have enough space for your stencils, and look for ones that don't have too many ridges. The smoother the pumpkin, the easier it will be to carve! Wipe them off with a damp paper towel to clean off any dirt, and dry them before applying the stencils.\nOn each pumpkin, first tape Saral transfer paper over the area you plan to carve. Saral paper is an easy way to get your stencil onto the pumpkin quickly and cleanly, and it's generally available in most art supply stores. Because the pumpkin is convex, you will have to fold creases into the paper to get it to lay as flat as possible - you may have to try a few times, but you'll get the hang of it! Once you have your transfer paper on the pumpkin, tape your stencil on top of it. Again, you'll have to fold creases into the paper; try to make the folds where they don't interfere too much with the drawing. If that's not possible (for instance, if you're doing a face and you have to fold the stencil in a way that cuts an eye in half), you can always adjust your drawing later with a pen directly on the surface of the pumpkin. With the Saral paper and stencil in place, trace over the lines with a ballpoint pen. Remove the paper and spray the pumpkin with fixatif (also easily found in an art supply store); this will keep the stencil from rubbing off while you carve. IMPORTANT: fixatif is a spray with pretty nasty fumes! I highly suggest spraying it outdoors, and leaving the pumpkin outside for 10-15 minutes afterwards to let the smell dissipate.\nDo this for each pumpkin in your scene. Depending on how complex each image is, this could take around 30 minutes per pumpkin.\nTools:\nSaral paper (I use white, though it comes in many colors)\nFixatif spray\nStencil\nTape\nBallpoint pen\nPaper towels", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPR/EF4F/IV0AABPA/FPREF4FIV0AABPA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8X/LX4T/IV0AABPC/F8XLX4TIV0AABPC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLL/5CKR/IV0A9ZBF/FLL5CKRIV0A9ZBF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAT/09S9/IV0A9Z8O/FAT09S9IV0A9Z8O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3R/UK58/IV0A9ZA2/F3RUK58IV0A9ZA2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Get Your Pumpkins Ready & Apply Your Stencils"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Now you have your stencils on the pumpkins and it's time to carve!

This is a crucial step, and if it's done well it will make the rest of your job MUCH easier. I recommend cutting a hole in the back of the pumpkin, NOT around the stem. A pumpkin stem is full of nutrients, and leaving it in place will extend the life of your pumpkin by several days at least.\nUse a spoon and your hands to pull out the seeds and pulp. Once the inside of the pumpkin is relatively clean, use your large clay loop tool to start scraping out the meat of the pumpkin behind the stencil. Using the clay tool will be much quicker than using a spoon! I suggest scraping away at the pumpkin until it's just about 1/4 inch to 1/8 inch thick.

You can put your light inside a ziploc bag to keep it from getting pumpkin slime on it (especially recommended if you use your phone). In the case of a project like this Harry Potter scene, you will only need one light while you carve (unless you can somehow carve more than one pumpkin at once!) but you will need 5 lights, one for each pumpkin, in order to illuminate the final scene all together. I used two cell phones, one flashlight, one camping lantern, and one bicycle light - basically, whatever I had lying around the house.\nIMPORTANT: Don't use candles!

I've used around 1,8kg of tooling resin and 4 layers of 400g/m\u00b2 chopped fiberglass mats. You might think isn't this an overkill of materials to make a mould?

Some individuals traded something they were wearing with something they liked from the cart. A few others who passed by the previous day returned to donate clothes from their closets.\nI really enjoyed the genuine shock and appreciation people felt when they heard that the garments on the rack were free. Not only did I feel like the project was giving back to the community, but the people were giving back as well. There were moments when my team wasn't attending the cart, instead we sat across from it. This allowed us to examine how people would engage with the cart without a representative activating the space for them. Without anyone there to witness, individuals left their own clothing in replacement of the one they took from the rack. I felt like this almost exemplified that the people that need this sort of community donation based site are the ones that would honestly engage in it.\nI started out with 40 pounds of clothing that I found that were going to be thrown away or donated. Some of them still had tags, but most of them were gently worn garments. By the end of the three days, my cart was empty! 40 pounds of garments found new homes and were prevented from going to the landfills.

But you can use any shoe that you like!\n2) Yarn - Any acrylic yarn will work. I have found that 100% wool yarn does NOT work. The chain just wouldn't adhere, so use acrylic yarn and save yourself the headache. Keep in mind the thinner the yarn the more it will take to cover the shoe, and the thicker the yarn the wider the crochet lines will be. I used a (4) medium weight yarn. I also used a yarn with a bit of sparkle to it, but that is a matter of personal taste. There is no gauge to this project, use whatever you have on hand!\n3) Crochet hook - Any crochet hook will work, pick one that works well with your yarn. In my case medium weight yarn and a 5.00 mm hook (US 8/H)\n4) Glue for the shoe \u2013 The glue is E6000 and there are now lots of different kinds of this brand of glue on the market. The type I used is the Industrial strength permanent adhesive. This glue dries clear, but more importantly it dries flexible which is a big deal for a shoe that is going to need to flex with your foot!\n5) A tip for the glue \u2013 This is the most important thing you need to make these shoes!!! The neck of the glue is very large and the glue comes out in globs, unless you use a special tip. I found mine at Fire Mountain Gems (www.firemountaingems.com) Be aware there are 2 different tips based on what size bottle of glue you have. The glue can also be purchased at Fire Mountain. One more note on this glue, the first 2 bottles I had both ruptured towards the bottom of the tube. I finally ended up duck taping the entire 3rd tube of glue to keep it in tack. That did work well.\n6) Glue for laces - You can use the laces that come with the shoes you are decorating, or you can be more creative.

For those of you asking yourselves \"But aren't zucchini those small thin pumpkins I eat throughout the summer?\" The answer is Yes, Yes they are.

If you are doing it for the first time, use a permanent marker to draw the pattern like I did. Best way to cut a zig-zag pattern is to place knife's tip in one of indented corners and tapping it so it cuts through pumpkin's wall. Repeat that twice for each \"tooth\".\nOn top of being the easiest, Zig-zag cut is also by far the safest way of cutting pumpkins open as it keeps your hands away from sharp blade.\nNote that cuts must not be made vertical to ground as that would let the \"hat\" fall inside your pumpkin and you won't be able to get it out. This can't really be a problem with thin and tall pumpkin such as mine but keep that in mind for when you will be carving regular pumpkins.\nImportant! Where you will want to cut the top off depends on diameter of your pumpkin. You can estimate what the size of the opening will be by subtracting about 4 cm from diameter of your pumpkin (walls are roughly 2 cm thick). Keep in mind you have to be able to fit your hand through the hole to empty your pumpkin! If you would have to cut your pumpkin very low and that would make you run out of pumpkin to carve, there is a solution for this: make the cut at an angle. Make sure that higher part of this cut will be facing forward (where you want to carve your pumpkin).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FDH/YU8B/IUYD5MY3/FDHYU8BIUYD5MY3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8Y/HDGH/IUYD5NIY/F8YHDGHIUYD5NIY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV6/XLUR/IUYD5MY7/FV6XLURIUYD5MY7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Cutting the Top"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "All you need to hollow your pumpkin is a spoon or just your fingernails.

First and foremost, I am a HUGE fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and carving something you really like is always more fun! But secondly, this image has GREAT contrast and details. Captain America's shield deflecting Iron Man's repulsor ray makes for a spectacular central focus, with it's bright light and shower of sparks.

Shave off JUST the skin, and a little more light shows through, so this area will now be a bit brighter/lighter. There you go, two different shades from a pumpkin! Go a step further and shave off the skin and some pumpkin flesh... now you have an even lighter color showing through. Go yet further than that, and carve ALL the pumpkin away... now you have the brightest shade of them all!\nThe brief description above gets you 4 different shades, all with a very simple (but, I understand, hard to fine tune) technique.

Then along the length of your box measure 200mm in from the front to the back. (If your box is bigger, think of the length of your box size in 3rds, then make mark on 1/3 of box more to where the front will be.)\n\nExample: My Box is 600mm Length x 500mm Width x 470mm Height.\n\n(Photo5)On opposite sides of the 600mm length, I measured from the forward edge of the box 200mm on both sides. Where the 200mm and 100mm mark meet\n\n(Photo 6,7) Poke a hole into the box with a pen or sharp object. The hole on the other side must be equal in height and distance from the front and base edge of the box, to allow you to push the dowel rod through to the other side of the box.\n\n(Photo7,8)So it sits level and straight.\n\nMeasure the length of your W30mmxT20mm Pine to be the same as your length of the box, plus add another 100mm.\n\nExample: If my box Length600mm, I measure the pine at 700mm and then cut it.\n\n(Photo9) Find the center on the front of the box, in this case Width500mm which the center will be 250mm and mark it. Using that mark, measure from the base of the box up to 130mm.\n\n(Photo10,11) If your piece of pine is W30mm, then measure 20mm to each side of that center line, just add 5mm to each side of the width of your pine if its wider. Draw a line down both sides meeting up with the line you drew at 130mm.\n\n(Photo12)Then cut this piece out.\n\n(Photo13,14)Just above the top of that slot you just cut out, measure 100mm up, that's the end point of the arrow, then draw the arrow facing down towards the slot, you just cut out now, and then cut the arrow out as well. Paste a piece of Red A4 paper to the inside of that arrow covering over the hole you cut out.\n\n(Photo15) If you have the Ultimate Box, cut out the coin slot above that arrow, and another more squashed arrow above the coin slot.

Push the pine up against the back wall of the box, then move it forward by 50mm. Making sure it is lined up properly and straight, and not restricted by movement on the rear wall of the box,\n\n(Photo2,3)with the other end of Pine protruding from the front of the box, where you cut out the slot, it should also balance by being held up by the slot you cut out in the front.\n\n(Photo4) Mark on the dowel where the pine sits on either side of it, then mark the pine in the center where the dowel crosses it. Remove both and line it up where you marked it and drill a small hole, through the pine and a little into the dowel.

Insure that the short piece of pine's end, that protrudes out to the right, is slightly moved away from the right side wall of the box, about 30mm. Remove it and where marked, line it up again and drill two holes side by side, again straight through the top piece of pine and a little into the piece under it, then screw these two pieces together.\n\nMaking the Cheap Hinges \u2013 Made from postcard thickness card.\n\n(Photo7,8) Cut out 4x pieces of cardboard to the same size of the diagram I\u2019ve provided, then glue two of each piece together so you now have 2x hinges.\n\n(Photo9,10)Fold it in half, then glue the dowel end to the card, but allowing the dowel to be moved up by 10mm from the line of the fold in the hinge.

Allow the Pine to rest on top of the dowel, like a cross, the weight of the dowels and the pine jutting out front, should rest against the top of the slot you cut, helping to stabilize it.

Now check that when you press down on the leaver in the front of your box that the seesaw works and that, its not constricted by movement, up and down inside the box.

All kind of people can come and visit or use the devices and tools there.\nI wanted to make a little something to decorate it for Halloween.\nAs it\u2019s a place with a lot of people passing by, like parents with their children, or teachers with their classes of 14 - 15 years-old, I also thought the decor as a toy :\nThe background and the frame are joined together, but the other elements can be moved at will. They hold in place thanks to simple magnets. Anybody who stops by the decor can recreate the scene freely.\n\nIn the following steps, I'll expose how I made my decor, but I'll also give some alternatives and other ideas.\nThe list of supplies depends on how you will make your own.\nList of supplies :\n3 boards of MDF and/or carboard\nMagnets\nLaser engraving machine (can be replaced by a pair of scissors and a pen)\nScissors / pincers / cutter\nHot glue\nA few screws (their length is 2 times the thickness of a board) and a screwdriver\nA metallic grid/panel OR empty soda cans.\nSome paint and brushes.\nMany optional supplies like wire, plastic eyes, fake spider webs, phosphorescent paint, glitter...\nEstimation of the cost :\n9 euros for the wood : MDF is a cheap material. One 50cmx70cm board costs around 3 euros.\n3 euros for 10 magnets.\nI think paint and brushes are common supplies for kids or makers, so you might have some. If it's not the case, I suggest you buy paint (Blue,Yellow, Red, Black and White) in bulk to get it cheaper. Let's say you use for 6 euros of paint and brushes here.\nThe cost of 1 hour of laser engraving is very likely to vary between 2 Fablabs but if you make a \u00ab clean \u00bb file that will be fast to produce, 1 hour is more than enough and that makes around 10 more euros.\nIt reaches 28 euros but it's a quite expensive version.\nYou can find a lot of alternative solutions.\nUsing carboard from old packages instead of MDF will cut by a third the previous estimation. Moreover, with this material, a bit of patience and scissors can also replace the use of the laser engraving machine.\nWe need a metallic part made of iron/steel. A panel or a grid is the simplest way but will increase the cost, whereas some empty soda cans are actually made of steel and can be used instead.\nWith these modifications, the most expensive step will be the painting process and to sum up, I think you can make this project for a cost between 5 and 30 euros.", "title": "Interactive Halloween Decor", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Interactive-Halloween-Decor/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I\u2019m not really good at drawing, so I looked for pictures on the internet... for the frame, the background, and the figurines (for everything). But if you are skilled enough with a pen, you can create your own masterpiece :)\nThe background :\nThe choice of the background influences the kind of figurines you will use.\nI chose a landscape. The moon and the large sky are perfect for bats and flying witches. We can place many graves on the ground, and why not ghosts around the house.\nIdeas :\n**The inside of a mansion could also be great. You can think about something like a large diner room, with a fireplace, large stairs, old shelves. The figurines for this kind of decor could be cats, spiders, ghosts, mice. An other version could be a laboratory, with shelves full of glowing potions, a witch working next to her cauldron etc.**\nNow we have to recreate this picture on our wooden board. As we are going to paint the whole thing later, the main outlines could help us. For this purpose, I used the laser engraving machine of the association.\nFablab users are always there to help beginners, to explain how machines work and to teach you how to use them.\nTo control the machine, we use RDWorksV8. You only have to import a picture, and a couple of menu and tools gives you the outlines you need. Then you can easily remove some unnecessary details, like the bats, as they will be figurines.\nI don't think explaining the software is useful here. If you have to use it, that means you are familiar with laser engraving machines, or ar least somebody in the makerspace is.\nA few things to keep in mind though : we'll place a frame on this first board, so we have to center the landscape in it and leave a few centimeters at each edge. About the speed and power of the laser, we need a high speed and a low power. That way, we get a light outline to help us with the painting part.\nIn my version I tried a higher power, and a much more detailled file. I wanted to give the building and the moon some kind of relief, but I don\u2019t find the result satisfying. It also takes more time, and time is what you pay with the laser engraving machine.\nThe frame :\nI chose to give the decor a bit of depth so I cut the frame in an other board and glued it over the background board. (Glueing step come at the end of the project)\nThis part is the same as the previous one. You can find a nice frame on the internet and cut it with the machine. I took 3 different frames I then mixed to make mine.\n\nHere, a little warning about the machine :\nSometimes even with the slowest speed and the highest power, the laser won't go through the board. It depends on the thickness of your board, the age and condition of the machine.\nIt's not a problem for big pieces, as you can exerce a bit of pressure on the board to remove them.\nBut for projects that involve small details, (the spider web in the corner for example), you can't use brute strength.\nThe tip here is to launch the program twice. You'll be sure to go through the board.\nIf you want to save time, RDWorks enables you to select only the areas you need to cut again.\n\nActually... I thought my board was thin enough to get cut at the first try. It wasn't. And it's almost impossible with our machine to put the board back at the exact same place to cut it again. I added pictures of the results to this step. It took me a while to end the cuts by hand.\n\nWe are not wasting the rest of the board as it will be used for the figurines.\nAnd painting come later.\n\n****Cheap version****\nYou don't want to spend money on this machine, or wood supplies?\nYou can take a large piece of carboard, use the picture as a model and draw the shapes by yourself or with tracing paper. This way, children can get involved in the production of the decor, at least with the drawing part.

(the magnet attracts these cans)\nSome others Instructables already explain how to properly cut soda cans. To make it quick :\nClean the inside with water.\nThe top and bottom are stronger than the rest. Don't waste your scissors on them. Pierce a little hole on the edge with your scissor.\nCut through the height of the can and then all around to get a sheet of steel.\nNow you can grab it freely, cut all the sharp tiny bits there may be around it.\nYou can flatten the sheets by rolling them the other way they tend to roll when you don\u2019t touch them.\nYou could glue them directly on the back of the background board but if the layer of glue is thick, it will add some distance between the magnetic material and the magnet. It will reduce the attraction power and make it not really uniform. That's why it's better to glue them to the third board instead.\nEach time I glued a sheet on the board, I rubbed and pressed it with a little piece of wood to spread the glue.\n\nIdea :\nAccording to your own decor, there may be some areas where there won't be any figurines on it.

Don\u2019t make your figurines too small, or we\u2019ll see the magnet behind.\nWarning : Spiders usually have some really thin legs. It really is a problem with the laser engraving machine. The results can be very fragile. In the pictures of this step, I put two different example of spiders so you can get an idea of what would work and what wouldn't.\n\nIn my case, I took some magnets from an old hard drive I dismantled. They are easily breakable, so I hit them to get 3 little pieces.\nGlue one piece of magnet on the small figurines. Some bigger figurines like the witch require 2 pieces.

Once the logo has been fully transferred, remove the template and spread flour over the holes.

This method will require a lot of pressure on the pen to insure that the traced lines transferred onto the pumpkin. After the image is fully traced, the template can be removed.

Just remove the hard, outer layer, and take a spoon to thin out the inside walls on the pumpkin.

This is where raiding Goodwill or secondhand stores for old sheets can come in handy! Sheets are an excellent alternative to fresh cut fabric, but only if you find the sheets cheap enough (Grandmas linen closet, anyone?)! Don't forget to use coupons if you shop at fabric stores to save yourself some money! Check clearance aisles for cheaper fabric!\nThis project does not require a sewing machine!\nCustomizing this rug is super easy. Would you like a rug all in one color? Want your rug to be a rainbow of colors all mismatched? Do you want your rug to appear to have concentric circles in varying colors? Your answer will determine how much fabric you'll need for your rug and what colors to buy!\nThe white, beige, and gray rug I have pictured is another rug I completed a few months ago. This one I created with a half hearted concentric circle method, as you can see. If you'd like yours to be more precise, just be sure you change colors right when you complete a full rotation of crocheting around your rug!\n\nYou'll also notice the difference in tightness in the white, beige, and gray rug. Draw your attention to the very center. See how tight it looks and how there seems to be no gaps or holes? This is from pulling tighter loops when you crochet.

In this tutorial, I used 15 yards of total fabric (5yds yellow and 10yards deep blue) and my rug turned out to be 32 inches in diameter.\n-Use old sheets!\n-If you choose to buy extremely cheap fabric, beware that the fabric may be harder to work with because of the lower quality weave of the fabric and how stiff it is. Pre-washing may help but not much.\n-Experiment with fabric types! A snuggly flannel fabric will be thicker but may yield a softer rug!\n-If you're wanting a rug of one specific fabric, purchase a large quantity of that fabric or be ready to go back to purchase more if you run out of fabric before your rug is big enough for your liking.\n-If you're wanting a rug with concentric circles in varying colors, buying fabric may be a bit harder here, as each circle around the center will get bigger and it can be hard to determine how much you'll need. I would experiment with how much you'll need. You may need to buy as you go and as you figure out how much you'll need. Not optimal, but it may need to be what happens to achieve the concentric circle look.\n-If you're wanting a jumble of lots of colors and fabrics, just mix up the colors and fabrics you weave. Shopping clearance racks or scrap aisles is a good idea for this quilt or if you have just a lot of fabric you want to get rid of and use.\nCrochet Hook: Crochet hooks come in many sizes. For our purposes, I am using a size M hook. Pictured I have a P and Q hook just to show you the difference in size as well as style of hook.

I found that ripping my fabric took less time than cutting it. You don't need to be precise as you'll be weaving the fabric together and you won't ever notice if the fabric is crooked or anything like that.\nFor this tutorial, I rip my fabric. No matter what method you choose to get your strips, you'll want strips that are around 2 inches wide and as LONG as you can manage.\n\n-Cut a slit at the fabric end about 2 inches from the side. You want to save yourself from more work later on, so make sure you're ripping the fabric into as long of strips as you can.\n-Rip the fabric. You may notice some extra strings as you rip. Cut them away or rip them off as you go so they don't tangle you up as you separate the strips later on.\n-Save yourself some heartache and when you've ripped one, lay it cleanly on the floor or over a chair so you won't have to untangle a huge pile of strips. Our next step is to knot them together, so keep that in mind.\n\nFun facts:\n-I started with 5 yards of fabric. I stripped it down to 2 inch strips and ended up with 26 total strips of fabric.How many more times can I say strip? One more. Strip.\n-So, my original 5 yards of fabric yielded a total length of 130 yards of 2 inch strips with which to work.\n- Apparently, 130 yards of stripped fabric will only yield an 18in diameter circle rug. Mind blowing, right? As I said, you'll need a lot of fabric to create a decent sized rug.\n\n\nEDITED TO ADD:\n-I went out and bought 10 yards of deep blue in hopes that it would be enough to finish the rug to a bigger size.

It makes the crocheting process a bit easier for me.\n\nIf you are creating a rug with concentric circles or multi colored random scraps, you may want to hold off on attaching too many together, as you can't be sure how much you'll need once you begin creating your rows of color. You can always attach all your strips of one fabric together and then when you find you are done with your concentric circle or want to move on to a different fabric, you can cut the fabric.\n\n-Knot your strips together!

(5minutes)"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Here is where the work comes in.\n\nYou'll be passing your hook through loops from here on out to create your circular fabric rug. Just keep rotating your rug clockwise and finding the next loop!\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING:\n\nYou'll notice at times that your rug will either cup up the sides (see picture above) or will pucker/wave. Here's how to fix both problems:\n\nCupping: This means that you need to create more loops to make the rug bigger. This makes sense when you think about it, as you wouldn't have a rug if you kept only 10 loops in play the whole time. You'd end up making a tube rather than a flat object!\nTo fix the cupping issue, you will want to pass your hook through the same hole twice about every 3rd to 5th knot. I refer to crocheting once through each hole as a single loop. To create a double loop, just repeat the same hole again after you pass through it once and then move on to the next knot. I've found that when I see it cupping, I'll double my loop, then create 3 single loops, then double loop, then 3 more single. If you find it is still cupping, increase your double looping.\n\n\nToo much double looping can create a pucker or a wave!\n\nPuckering/Waving: This means you are creating more knots/loops than may be needed. This can be caused by a lot of factors such as the looseness of your crocheting, the fabric you've chosen, the thickness of the fabric, or if you've tried to compensate for cupping. Never fear!\n\nTo fix puckering and waving, you can either rip out the crochet work you've completed to before the puckering and redo that section, or you can skip a hole/loop. My preferred method is to skip a hole/loop. You may only need to skip 4 holes/loops, one on top, bottom, and either side. By skipping a hole/loop, you're pulling in the circle a bit. If you find that skipping the 4 holes/loops doesn't help, I recommend, unfortunately, undoing the work you've done and re-crocheting.\n\nTo avoid these two issues, I recommend crocheting on a flat surface and keeping a keen eye on your rug. Lay it flat often to see if it is cupping or puckering.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8C/L7AA/IUSM27UY/F8CL7AAIUSM27UY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN8/RPEP/IUSM27UZ/FN8RPEPIUSM27UZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYG/MJR3/IUSM27V2/FYGMJR3IUSM27V2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTM/LFXM/IUSM27V3/FTMLFXMIUSM27V3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU4/FYG5/IUSM27V6/FU4FYG5IUSM27V6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUC/WWVR/IUSM27VH/FUCWWVRIUSM27VH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGT/RJHE/IUSM27V7/FGTRJHEIUSM27V7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F48/NHXN/IUSM27VB/F48NHXNIUSM27VB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0C/HFTK/IUSM27VV/F0CHFTKIUSM27VV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFF/TO4J/IUSM27VC/FFFTO4JIUSM27VC.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Crochet Your Rug!

It's unicorn name is inspired by the rainbow colors and its ability to make everything magical just by wearing it.\nI used two different thick + thin yarns held together to give this hat extra sparkle and texture. The yarns I picked are kinda pricy, so feel free to substitute other yarns as needed. You'll want about 35 yds of extra bulky and 65 yards of a bulky yarn. And if you don't want so much texture, you can hold together two strands of the same yarn.\nEven if you're a beginning knitter, you can make this fun project.

Around the bottom of the jaw make the outline even looser than the top.\nCut the outlined area out and try to fit the jaw you will find that it does not fit and still needs a lot of trimming around the edges to do (make sure you cut the opening as a full piece and save it because this is the piece that you will use to cut the dorsal fin from). On the bottom edge of the cut out you are actually cutting back into the pumpkin giving it a more realistic slanted back look.\nAfter trimming and scooping out the mouth area enough to where your jaw fits inside the opening snug you are ready to begin on the following step (It is important that the jaw fits nice and tight because with any other pumpkin an opening this big would only last a couple days at most till it would begin to wilt and completely disfigure; The jaw actually works as a structural component to this design and your pumpkin will outlast all others.).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FY3/YOX8/IUKF4AAE/FY3YOX8IUKF4AAE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZP/XWXN/IUKF4A9S/FZPXWXNIUKF4A9S.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Preparing the Pumpkin and Cutting Out the Mouth"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Now that the jaw is in place and you know how much of the rest of the pumpkin you have to work with, grab your marker and get ready to draw in the rest of the details to be carved out.\n1.) begin with deciding the best eye location and drawing a circle on each side in relevance to to a real shark with its jaws open.\n2.) Now draw in the contour lines above the jaw coming down into an angry brow line above the eye as pictured.\n3.) On the lower side of the pumpkin draw in the V-shape contour on both sides to resemble the sharks pectoral fins.\n4.) In the space above the pectoral fins draw in the gill openings on both sides of your pumpkin. Most sharks have five.\n5.) Check the symmetry of the cutout lines you drew and now cutout all the sharks features.\n6.) With the big leftover piece you cut out initially for the mouth opening use as much as you can of it to draw an outline of the sharks upper dorsal fin. Cut it out and position it over the top opening where the stem used to be. Now cut a notch on the back side of the top round opening. Make the notch a little skinnier than the width of the fin you just cutout so that the fin fits in tight and is held up by itself over the opening. I was really happy that I decided to leave the top open with the fin exposed above it because when lit up at night you can clearly see the fin being lit up as well.\n7.) The last step is using your spoon or Dremel tool to shave back and blend in the defined top edge of the mouth cutout. This gives the scary appearance of the sharks gums that show distinctly when a shark has its jaws open. So what I did was mark a border line about 1\" offset from the opening of the upper jaw and shaved the pumpkin skin off getting deeper and deeper as you worked your way from the outside gum line to the jaw edge. This blends it round and makes it look the the jaws are actually a part of the pumpkin.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0L/EIOG/IUSLKLKV/F0LEIOGIUSLKLKV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPC/X95T/IUSLKLMM/FPCX95TIUSLKLMM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Carving the Gills, Eyes, Fins, & Gumline"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "This design has proven to be very resilient to keeping its shape.

Cut *ACROSS* the fold of the piece of paper where you wish for it to become 3-D\n2. Open the fold all of the way and fold the paper in the opposite direction along the originial fold\n3. Open the fold again and raise the cut portion towards you as you begin to close along the original fold\n4. Fold the paper closed along the fold and \"hyper-extend\" the cut section towards you to create what I call a \"Reverse Fold\"\n5. Crease along the new folds\n6. The resulting closed paper will have a section missing from it where you cut along the folds. This section will be \"Reverse Folded\" up inside the closed card\nNOTE: This method will create a 3-D block that comes toward the reader as far as it goes up.

They were pretty easy to make.\n\nWe're doing here a pair of bended horns, and a single horn. So if you're searching for a random horn tutorial for halloween, this might be useful !\n\nHowever, I highly recommend using a headband instead of hairclips.

Is not much visible, but still not good enough. Next time I will try use of PVC glue for this step.\nTo fix ship to bottom of bottle I use clear two component epoxy glue. Hardening time is varying from several minutes to 24 hours, depend on brand, and this is enough time to adjust ship in all directions.\nFew tips:\nI used cotton threads for this ship. Cotton thread is bubbling and making mess between many threads. It looks not very good and make work more difficult. So better to use fully synthetic thread.\nSuperglue is spreading beyond fixing point of thread and then hardens, so when gluing thread make sure that it is positioned in the right direction, otherwise after tensioning it will have some breaking angle. Use superglue gel instead of liquid one. Liquid is very runny and hardening time is instant, which in case of mistake will not give time to fix mistake. Gel is allowing few moments to adjust parts.\nWhen threading thread through small loops inside of bottle, that may be very difficult mission. To make thread easier to control, tip end of the thread with small amount of superglue. It will make thread end hard and it will act as kind of needle.\nNever cut threads unless 100% sure that is glued well, and it in right place and right tension.\nTo help with mess of all threads coming out of bottle neck, group them mast by mast and run through plastic cocktail straws. This will reduce risk of accidentally putting glue on threads, also will simplify movement of tools inside of bottle neck.\nSometimes accidentally glue can touch inner wall of bottle. Not big deal \u2013 wait until it is completely dry and scratch with aluminum wire. Scratched particles of dry glue can be removed by cotton swab. I use aluminum wire due to softness of metal; steal wire or cutting blade can scratch also glass surface.

I have, however, made a few minor changes in the degumming methodology as I've since learned more from experience. Listed:\n1) Allow the cocoons to ret in the lye and baking soda solution. Once you've boiled the cocoons, leave them in the solution for at least a day up to three. This will allow most of the gum to dissolve and the fibers to separate more easily. It will smell like yucky wet rags, but it does make a huge difference.\n2) Lift the cocoons from the solution individually and wash out the lye by squeezing a few times under a running faucet. Once clean, you may squeeze all the water out and leave the cocoons out to dry for future use.\n3) When you want to spin, place a few of the processed cocoons in a container of water.

In this case, however, the silk is wet. As previously mentioned, it can be quite tricky and requires a bit of confidence,. Or you can try dry spinning the silk. I will stick to wet spinning as it's part of my tribal heritage and apparently yields better quality yarn. .\nSorry about the video quality (I'll eventually find some time to make a better one), but it should give you an idea of what I'm doing.\nAgain, refer to my previous instructable at step 4. The steps are the same, except that you don't have to spin with your fingers because the spindle is doing it for you. Your job now is just to ensure that you're pulling down a more or less even amount of fiber to feed into the yarn. Also, keep the cocoon wet as the water helps separate the fibers from sticking to the cocoon.\nYou can get at least 30 feet of continuous yarn from a single cocoon if you're having a lucky day.\nTips:\n1) Do not do a death grip with the hand holding the cocoons. Your fingers need to be loose enough in order to let the fibers slip down to join the yarn.\n2) Don't move too fast. You might feel the urge to keep pulling down the fibers to keep up with the spinning- but just relax and find your own comfortable rhythm.\n3) Don't panic. Some times the thread will break because the fibers were weak to start with (some cocoons are just like that), and sometimes for no reason at all. Just shrug and rejoin the thread.\n4) Stand up. I find that standing is the best position. I also like walking around a bit.

A prime example of his exploratory work is in the beautiful cut and pressed aluminium domes that you can see in the photo shoot for this Instructable.\nI saw the potential for the use of such parametric patterns in footwear. The dashed lines when cut can open up or remain closed as they form over the shoe last. With the correct combination and pattern of cuts you can add support or increase flexibility where required.\nWe started by taking his pattern and cutting it from leather. We laid this on a shoe last and began adjusting the many options available such as line orientation, line length, density etc. Changing these variables allows you to increase flexibility or stiffness all around the shoe in a unique way. This pattern also adds an attractive aesthetic to the shoe, tracing the contours of the last shape with closed or open cuts in the leather.\nFunnily, after the first test I was browsing the web for other similar styles and no sew designs and I stumbled across a 4th century design from Northern Europe. Known as the Damendorf or Barbarian shoe it was fabricated using one piece of heavyweight leather and as such required no stitching. I was certainly surprised to see such a similar looking design from such a long time ago!

The design will use a 'mule' style front section and a heel cup for the back part. As there are two pieces it should allow enough flexibility of the material to allow your foot to get in and out of the shoe.\nThe shoe will be unlined and cut from a fairly heavy weight leather so the cut pattern will offset the stiffness of the material. As I have access to a laser cutter I have added a parametric pattern design to the shoe. If you do not have access to a laser cutter you could leave the pieces of the shoe blank with no pattern or cut the leather by hand.\nThe shoe pictured uses EVA foam for the sole.

Save those seeds, they are healthy and if cooked right can be delicious.\nSpoon - A large sturdy spoon is best.\nKnife, or carving kit - I was on a budget, so I used a small kitchen knife. For more detailed pumpkin carvings, I recommend a carving kit, or various sized knives.\nToilet Paper - At the Dollar Tree, I found 4 rolls for $1.\nFuel - Again at the Dollar Tree, I bought a few cans of Fancy Heat Canned Fuel for $1 each. I've also done this project with Kerosene. I will mention some pros and cons of each later.\nContainer - Something to fit a roll of toilet paper in, glass or metal preferably.\nLighter/Matches - Long lighter preferably.\nSafety Items - Have a fire extinguisher nearby.

The story does not have to be long or refined :)\nHere is my short story I wrote for my scene:\nWe had spent the fall lobbying to have the abandoned baby bottle factory torn down. The dilapidated buildings stood just beyond the south end of our patch and were an unsightly blot on an otherwise picturesque little community. Granny used to say it was haunted and as a little greenling I believed her, but even as my orange came in I steered clear of the place.\nThe wind was changing, coming cold and quick from the north. The chill quieted the field and surrounding forests as the familiar silence of the approaching winter washed over the countryside.\nThough winter had come and gone for as many years as I could recall, this season felt different. The air felt heavy, with great gusts that would send a pumpkin rolling right across the field except for a firm grip on the vine. Adding to the strange weather, an anxious tension permeating the patch as our county sheriff had been called out of town to rumors of a strange illness spreading in our neighboring community. \"Oh! don't let it be the blight!\", I heard the older folks say. I had only ever heard stories but the reference to the old legends sent a shiver up my stem.\nOne night the wind blew with unusual strength. I remember we were hunkered down in and out of sleep as the gusts would rise and fall.\nI was jolted awake by the sound of a mighty crash and spent the few hours until dawn tossing and turning with speculation and anticipation. Upon inspection the next morning we found that the largest of the smoke stacks had fallen in the midst of the old factory.

If that is you, I applaud your efforts and more power to you. If you are like me and you don't like the slime or the smell on your hands, a latex or plastic glove will do the trick :)\nTo begin, I like to give each pumpkin a good scrubbing with water to remove any residual dirt and make that orange really pop. Set them outside or under a fan to dry.\nNext, insert your saw at a slanted angle up by the stem (the tip of your blade should be facing inward towards the center of the shape you intend to cut). The slanted angle will allow you to pull the top off easily and replace it as a lid without it falling inside the pumpkin.\n*Time saver tip: Maybe it is just me but I have had trouble in the past putting the lid back on a pumpkin I've opened up, having to spin the top around trying to get it back in place. To solve this problem I like to cut in a circle, but will add a little variation to the shape so I can easily figure out the proper orientation of the lid for a perfect fit.\nScoop out the insides with your preferred method and scrape the sides clean with the melon baller (works best on the smaller pumpkins), the scraper provided in your carving kit (works best on the larger pumpkins), or whatever you have around the house that can do the job.\n*Be thorough in your extraction of the innards.

If all you have is a marker, that will do just fine :)\nYou may also sketch your faces out on paper first and trace them onto the pumpkin by poking a series of holes along the lines of your drawing while holding the paper up against the front of the pumpkin.\nOnce you have all your faces drawn or traced onto the pumpkins you can begin carving.\nI like to begin with the saw and do all the main cutouts first (I use the corkscrew to snag any pieces that get stuck and pull them out - though for the larger pieces you can just as easily reach your hand in and pop them out from the inside).\nI then move to my mini melon-baller to carve out details and add interest and value to each face. If you scape away the skin of the pumpkin rather than cutting all the way though, you get a lovely orange glow that increases in brightness each time you remove a layer from the surface.\n*A small bevel at the edge of each cut can give your pumpkin a cleaner look.\nWhen assembling more complex creations with multiple pumpkins, toothpicks can serve to aid in structural integrity.

It was one of the many installations that were part of the 2016 Market Street Prototyping Festival. The project consists of six pillars composed of a series of panelized mirrors. Each one of these mirrors is angled differently as to produce a kaleidoscope effect, reflecting the complex moments of Market Street in a collage of reflected images. One pillar, for example, may contain a matrix of reflections, collapsing Market Street\u2019s verticality by bringing together images of the sky, the sidewalk, and the pedestrians and vehicles that inhabit it. The angles of these mirrors can be adjusted by the user, allowing people to compose an endless number of collages. The installation contains, in its entirety, five pillars of three varying heights, facing five different directions. The panelized mirrors are located on both sides of the pillar, which rests on a structural wooden base.\nCreated by the Paper Fly Collective, composed of Etienne Ma and Timothy Wei, this installation aimed to reveal the beauty of Market Street through reflection \u2013 of ourselves, each other, and environment around us. These pillars are at times monuments and at others canvasses.

The nuts will hold the mirrors in place while also allowing us to control the tension of each individual mirror panel.\nDampen and apply Gorilla glue to the first side of each wood piece. Also dampen 3 mirror panels in the places that will make contact with the wood pieces. Apply the mirrors to the wood pieces, then flip them all over so that you can affix the mirrors to the other side.\nRepeat Step 3 on the other side, then adjust the mirrors so that they are straight.\nPlace a heavy object, or objects on the mirrors to apply pressure while the glue sets. It should take between 60 - 120 minutes\nStep B: Building the bases:\nAffix the sheets of pine to the OSB using 3 L-brackets on the 4 foot pine boards and 2 L-brackets on the 3 foot pine boards. Use additional L-brackets on the corners to provide additional support.\nSecure an additional pine board 7.5 inches from the width of the base using 2 L-brackets in the base and two on the sides.\nStep C: Building the frames:\nEach panel of wood will be comprised of two panels screwed together.\nWe\u2019ll first need to drill holes into the side panels; each hole should be X inches apart, and we\u2019ll later insert the rods through these holes.\nSecure the top and bottom pieces to one side using 2 L-brackets at each corner.\nInsert the panels of mirrors into each hole before closing off the frame with the other length piece.\nUse L-brackets to secure the last panel onto the frame.\nAttach the coupling nuts to the outside of the rods.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FXQ/QFXW/IUOHQW1F/FXQQFXWIUOHQW1F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9W/4YB5/IUOHQW34/F9W4YB5IUOHQW34.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE3/O4AF/IUOHQW47/FE3O4AFIUOHQW47.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Fabrication"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Each Pillar is fabricated in two pieces for easy transportation installation: the mirrored frames and the bases.

Craft pumpkin (brands include Funkins). These are foam pumpkins you can purchase at a local hobby store or order on the internet.

There are beginners patterns available at a hobby store, but also online (see Stonykins for more difficult patterns as an example). Also be sure that the pattern fits your pumpkin. The pumpkin is curved and has lines which you will need to account for when carving\n3. Glue: Elmers washable school. You will need to attach your pattern to your pumpkin and I find this glue is best.\n4. Dremel tools: For more intricate carvings and layers, use various sizes of the Dremel tools: I use the Dremel 3001 Multi-speed tool with the flexible shaft that allows me better control. Also the Dremel 4486 MultiPro Keyless Chuck makes it easy to switch out the various bit sizes.\n5. Light bulb and holder: To light up your pumpkin, you can use a low voltage light (like a Christmas light). Although usually I use a white bulb, it's fun to mix up the color (I did Frankenstein one year with a green light which added a nice effect).\n6. Workspace: Because you are carving into a foam pumpkin, there will be alot of shavings. Be sure to have a workspace that is easy to clean up.\n7.

Mario! Link! Sonic! And they're all just squares, right? \"I can learn to crochet,\" you tell yourself. \"I can make a simple square,\" you tell yourself.\nWRONG.\nYes, crochet granny squares are easy. But making 200+ of them? Filling up boxes and boxes of carefully counted squares? And, the most important part that nobody tells you about, SEWING 200 SQUARES TOGETHER? You will spend dozens of hours making squares. You will spend MORE hours piecing the whole thing together. It will be your nightmare.\nFriends, it doesn't have to be this way. I recently had a good friend of mine announce a pregnancy, and knew immediately that I needed to make her a Kirby blanket. I, like the rest of humanity, am LAZY by nature so I set out to make a simple no-nonsense blanket that would actually get done before the baby was born. Thus! I present to you: a granny square blanket with only ONE round per square, is attached together as you go, and only has one tail per square to tie off.

So if this Kirby is 16x16 pixels, he will end up being about 32x32 inches... perfect for a baby blanket! Or, if you add a non-skid rug backing to the back of it, a great floor rug! If you'd like something bigger or twin/queen/etc bed sized, add a background, a border, more sprites, a bigger sprite, etc.\n(In the end my gauge was closer to 1.75 inches square because the rows do overlap a tiny bit, so my blanket turned out 28x28 inches.)", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Picking Your Pattern"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Worsted weight yarn-- the cheap stuff works fine and comes in a whole bunch of colors.
