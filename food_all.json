Some people add milk or cream, some people say don't add milk or cream. I have made omelets with water, with milk, without any added liquid, etc. It is up to you. I recommend trying all those options. But whatever you do don't add too much a couple teaspoons to a tablespoon for a few eggs is the most you probably want to add. The idea is the added liquid makes the eggs more fluffy. Also there is a bit of debate about the salt, and when you should add it. If you add the salt and then walk away from your eggs and come back 15 to 30 minutes later the eggs will change color and become almost light orangish.

If they are too thick they will have a hard time bending, but don't worry about it too much. really thin ones are good for creating the center rose. Another method is to use a mandolin slicer. If you don't core the apples first after wards you can dig out the core with a melon baller, but that takes more time do it that way.

In early days people were a bit easy with children and alcohol and often made an exception for holidays so we always got a piece of sneeuwster at Easter, a treat we loved. At home advocaat was always made by my mum at Easter and my dad baked the sneeuwster. My dad always baked apple pie, butter cake, oliebollen, cake. You name it, he made it. My mum preferred to cook and prepare, 7 days a week, a three course menu and always with a lot of vegetables from our garden. We as children had to learn to cook and bake at a young age and we still like to do that.\n\nFor this Easter, I looked up my mums advocaat recipe and my dads sneeuwstar recipe because without advocaat no sneeuwster.\n\nActually you make advocaat with a special Dutch brandy, but that is, just like advocaat, outside the Netherlands not or barely not for sale. Replaced by another brandy, it can be less tasty for not every brandy is suitable so I have replaced the brandy with vodka. Vodka is generally available and a good alternative.\n\nWhat is advocaat? Advocaat is difficult to translate because the English translation for advocaat is lawyer so I wanted to know where the name came from to translate it right. There are several explanations, but I found the most funny explanation on Wikipedia where you can read:\n\n\u201cAdvocaat is the Dutch word for \"lawyer\". As the name of the drink, it is short for advocatenborrel, or \"lawyer's drink\", where borrel is Dutch for a small alcoholic beverage consumed slowly during a social gathering. According to the 1882 edition of the Woordenboek der Nederlandsche taal (Dictionary of the Dutch Language), it is \"zoo genoemd als een goed smeersel voor de keel, en dus bijzonder dienstig geacht voor een advocaat, die in 't openbaar het woord moet voeren\" (\"so named as a good lubricant for the throat, and thus considered especially useful for a lawyer, who must speak in public\u201d). So I just decide to keep the Dutch name: Advocaat. I couldn\u2019t use eggnog as translation for advocaat is certainly not eggnog.", "title": "Sneeuwster and Advocaat a Dutch Treat for Easter", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Sneeuwster-and-Advocaat-a-Dutch-Treat-for-Easter/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "What do you need:\n\nFor the advocaat:\n12 egg yolks at room temperature\n25 gr.

However, do not cut to the edge but stop about 3 cm before you reach the edge.\n\nBeat the cream with icing sugar until stiff, if necessary use a stabilizer to get a firm whipped cream.\n\nNow cover the lower part of the cake with a thick layer of advocaat and then scoop the cream onto the advocaat. Make sure the whipped cream in the middle makes a dome. Place the top part of the cake on the whipped cream and lightly press the outer edge. Because the whipped cream in the middle makes a dome, the incised points will open and form a star.

Other than Peanut Chikki it also comes in different varieties such as dry fruit Chikki, coconut Chikki etc.\nI think it's worth mentioning how Chikki came into existence.\nHistory of Peanut Chikki\nBack in the early 1900s, when railway lines were established in India, railway tracks were constructed to connect Mumbai and Pune. There comes a stop between them, this small town. Lonavla(famous hill station).\nDuring that time major parts of India were affected by famine including Mumbai. The construction work was huge and poor laborers needed energetic food to work efficiently. Chikki was invented by a local sweet seller of Lonavla named Mr. Maganlal. Chikki as being a healthy source of nutrients and affordable to every economy made it popular among workers. And later among travelers as Railway asked him(and his sons) to sell Chikki to travelers. The business is still well going after 5 generations in Lonavla. It\u2019s been 120 years since then and now Chikki is popular as winter snack all over India and its other neighbor countries(Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka).\nCredit for its massive popularity is also because of its easy preparation.\nPreparation Time: 30 mins approx.", "title": "Chikki Aka PEANUT JAGGERY BAR", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Chikki-Aka-PEANUT-JAGGERY-BAR/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Ingredients\n1-2 cup of Peanuts (100-150 grams)\n1 cup of Jaggery\nWater\nGhee (Clarified Butter)\nSupplies\nPan\nStirrer Stick\nPlate\nBowl\nKitchen towel\nKnife\nMarble board (optional)\nAll set.

The idea here is just to not have the chocolate directly on the heat source but there are lots of ways to do this.\n\nSo onto the chocolate melting.\n\nStart with good, dark chocolate. Break it up into small pieces and place it in an empty bowl over the boiling water. The chocolate will melt and you can toss in your dried orange slices. I find I can do between 6-10 in a 'batch' before it becomes too cluttered to work in the bowl.\n\nIf I'm honest, this is always the part of the process that feels like it can go on forever. I now feel like it's a form of meditation but give yourself ~30 minutes to work through 2 oranges worth of orange peel.\n\nAfter experimenting with many kitchen utensils, I've landed on my favorite method which is two forks used in tandem. I fish out a single piece with one fork and volley it back and forth to let the excess chocolate drip back into the bowl before placing it onto the parchment paper.\n\nNote from other Instructablers: a great comment was made below about not overheating the chocolate at this stage as well as tempering the chocolate. Both are great refinements to this stage - thanks for making this Instructable even better:\n\"You might want to add warnings about not overheating the chocolate (ALWAYS under 120 deg F). My niece tried a chocolate candy (I wasn't around) andlet it get too hot: the result was grainy and ... not nice.

There are several ways to temper chocolate, but I would say the two easiest for home crafting is either using the double boiler/seeding method or the microwave method. I will be using the double boiler and seeding method (cause I like to pretend I'm fancy) but I will put a link to the microwave method for you here and it is just as easy. To get started with the method I'm using I'll need:\nThe glass bowl mentioned before\nA pot slightly smaller than the bowl so no steam will escape\nGood quality chocolate mentioned before\nGrab the pot and put about an inch or two of water into the bottom and bring to a simmer, while that is happening break up all the chocolate into smaller pieces if you happened to buy bars like I did, if you already have chips or wafers just leave them as is. Now place 1/3 of the total amount of chocolate to the side and that will be your \"seeding\" chocolate, the other 2/3 you can place into the glass bowl. Once the water is simmering then turn off the heat and place the glass bowl filled with chocolate on top of the pot and begin stirring. Not too much will happen at first and this is a slower process but good chocolate deserves the best treatment (like good food cooked low and slow). We are going to keep stirring until our chocolate melts completely and reaches 110-115 degrees Fahrenheit but NEVER over 120 degrees Fahrenheit according to the thermometer you are using.\nNext we will take the glass bowl off the pot and bring it over to the counter onto a clean dish towel (this just helps the bowl stay put while stirring as well as keeping the counter from getting wet). Keep stirring until the thermometer reads 96 or 97 degrees, then take the 1/3 reserved chocolate from before and add it to your melted chocolate then keep stirring until that melts and everything reaches a temperature of 85-86 degrees Fahrenheit.

Bring to a simmer for approximately 30-40 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes, check with a wooden spoon the consistency of the syrup by dipping the spoon into the solution and letting a couple drops fall onto a plate. If the syrup spreads for a second but holds its shape, it is ready. If it spreads out but does not hold its shape, it needs to be cooked longer. If the syrup solidifies and does not spread at all, it is overcooked. This could happen if the heat is too high and the water evaporated too quickly.

Every time you are not getting Phyllo sheets, you need to recover it with the towel or it will dry out and get crumbly.\n- Phyllo dough always goes down 2 sheets at a time. Those 2 sheets are always brushed on top with melted butter\n- When brushing with butter, have a light hand. It's fine if every inch isn't coated. You can use an extra tablespoon or 2 of butter if you run out - but too much more is going to make your baklava soggy. (but probably still delicious)\nTo assemble your baklava:\nBegin by brushing the bottom and sides of your dish with melted butter.\nPut 2 sheets of phyllo dough in your dish. Lightly brush these sheets with your melted butter.\nRepeat this 4 times, until you have 8 sheets of phyllo dough in your baking dish.\nNext, sprinkle some of your walnuts over the top.\nFollow this by 2 more sheets of phyllo dough, and brush the top with butter.\nNow, sprinkle with chocolate chips and bits of cherries.\n2 more phyllo sheets, butter, then walnuts.\n2 more phyllo sheets, butter, then chocolate and cherries.\nRepeat over and over!\nTo finish the top, repeat the 8 layers of dough, with butter between each two (like we did for the bottom)\nI like to set aside 8 sheets of phyllo dough for my top layers, so I don't have to keep counting while I'm assembling the baklava.\nHelpful hints:\n- Don't panic if your phyllo bunches up or tears. It's totally fine! You won't be able to tell in the end, it's nothing to stress about.\n- If your sides get too tall toward the end, you can just push them down into the baking dish when you're finished.\n- You don't have to have all the nuts, chocolate, or cherries on your layers perfect or even.

I either use the defrost setting on bursts of like 45 seconds then stir, or use the hi setting and do bursts of 30 seconds and then stir, until the chocolate is nice and melted, you may also use the double boiler method. After that dip your treat stick into the candiquick, about 3/4 of an inch, then stick it into your cake ball, about the same far. Don't poke it too far, we don't want it coming out the other side.

In order to create our 3D model, we will use Autodesk Sketchbook and Autodesk Fusion 360. Autodesk Sketchbook, is a software application that allows for you to transform your drawings into a digital format on a wide variety of devices (i.e. your computer, iOS and Android Device, and even your Fire Tablet). The second software application we are using, Autodesk Fusion 360, is a 3D design or CAD software that allows for you to transform your ideas into 3D models simply using your computer. As an added bonus, both software applications are free to use!\nNow, if the term \"CAD\" sounds unfamiliar to you, don\u2019t fear. CAD stands for Computer-Aided Design. It is a type of software that allows for us to build 3D objects using our computer. Once we are finished with our Fusion 360 CAD model, we can export the model to a 3D Printer, a machine that uses materials such as plastic in order to print physical objects. If you don't have access to a 3D Printer, you can also order a 3D print from VooDoo Manufacturing or explore your local resources to 3D Print your CAD Model (For Example; your local school or library).\nRegardless of what you decide to do with your CAD Model, the most important step is to get started.

Just like an Artist would use a Canvas to apply their masterpiece, we will do the same with our Sketch.\nNow, to create our Sketch of General Mayhem's Wings, we used the Autodesk Sketchbook App on our iPad in order to trace over an image of General Mayhem to obtain an outline of her wings (shown in the video below). You can also use Autodesk Sketchbook on your Phone, Fire Tablet, Computer (highly recommend either a Touchscreen Computer or use a Wacom Tablet or Digital Tablet accessory) to create a digital Sketch of General Mayhem's Wings.\nIf you prefer more traditional methods, you can use traditional pen and paper in order to outline General Mayhem's Wings, snap a picture, and use the image as a Canvas as well for your CAD Model.\n\nAlthough we like a little mayhem, we also understand if you would prefer to just jump straight into creating a CAD Model of General Mayhem's Wings in Fusion 360.\nSo...we've included our Outline of General Mayhem's Wings as a Download Below [you're welcome. ;)];\nGeneral Mayhem's Wings Outline Autodesk Sketchbook", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F9C/LLF2/JRYUBQXO/F9CLLF2JRYUBQXO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Sketch General Mayhem's Wings"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "After developing our Sketch of General Mayhem's Wings, we can now transform our Sketch into a CAD Model using Autodesk Fusion 360.\nIn Fusion 360, we are going to import our Sketch from Autodesk Sketchbook using the 'Insert Canvas' Tool in the Upper Toolbar on the Fusion 360 Workplane as shown below;\nOnce we have our Sketch imported into Fusion 360, we can begin creating a 2D Outline of General Mayhem's Wings using Fusion 360's 'Sketch Tool'.\nUsing the Sketch Tool, we will first use the 'Line Tool' to trace the straight components of General Mayhem's Wings.\nNext, we will use the 'Arc Tool' in order to trace the rounded edges and half arcs of General Mayhem's Wings in order to complete the basic outline.\nFinally, we need to use the 'Circle Tool' in order to complete tracing the middle of General Mayhem's Wings to complete our 2D Outline.\nContinue using the various Sketch Tools above until you complete your 2D Outline of General Mayhem's Wings.", "step_imgs": ["https://www.instructables.com/files/deriv/FO5/VOXZ/JS0ONVKK/FO5VOXZJS0ONVKK.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif"], "step_title": "Step 3: Import Sketch Into CAD Software"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "At this point, we have a 2D Outline of General Mayhem's Wings.\nPro Tip: If you want to make a Cookie Cutter that will leave an imprint on General Mayhem's Wings as well as cut them out, create another Sketch and only trace the edges of General Mayhem's Wings we want to remove as the Shortbread Cookie Shape.\nNow, we need to transform General Mayhem's Wings from a 2D Outline into a 3D Model.\nFirst, we need to 'Stop Sketch' in the Right-Hand Toolbar in order to complete our Sketch.\nNext, we need to 'extrude' or pull the Sketch from a simple 2D Model to a 3D Model using the 'Extrude' Tool in the Upper Toolbar;\nGiven we want our General Mayhem Cookie Cutter to cut the edge of General Mayhem's Wings, we want to extrude her wings at a height greater than the inner parts of her wing.

She had the opportunity to build a quick demo earthen oven at the conference and had quickly proclaimed that not having one at our house would be unacceptable... especially since she is a baker and the bread, pizza, chicken, pita, yoghurt, and pretty much everything else that comes out of it is amazing. We got a fair amount of our inspiration from her instructor at the conference Stu Silverstein and his book Bread, Earth, and Fire along with a couple of instructables, such as this one from cwolsey that had some elements we liked and planned on using.\nOverall the process to build a wood fired oven is straight forward and makes sense as long as you keep in mind a couple of basic rules following along the lines of middle school science :\n1) Conduction is both your enemy and your friend - Conduction is the process of energy (heat or electricity) traveling from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Stick your finger in a candle's flame and you will get burned because the energy will travel from the flame to your finger, stick your warm hands on a cold flag pole and you will get cold fingers as the energy travels from your hands to the pole until they reach equilibrium. The same holds true for a 1500F fire clay brick, put some bread dough on it and the energy will transfer from the brick to the bread dough, making sweet, flaky, crunchy bread! So, with this in mind, you need to make sure that energy only moves from the oven to your bread, and that the energy stays in the oven and does not move to the outside. Isolate the energy and insulate the oven correctly and you will be able to cook food in the oven for days!\n2) Thermal mass is key - Just because the cooking surface is thermally isolated doesn't mean that you will be able to cook a good pizza or loaf... even if the surface temp reads 1500F. That energy will quickly dissipate as it is transferred into the yeasty goodness you are cooking and if there isn't enough energy available you will end up with a half cooked loaf or floppy pizza. You need to have thermal mass to hold additional energy so that you can go through the entire cooking process. Of course the thermal mass must be isolated from the exterior of the oven, so you must insulate it pretty heavily if you want to be able to capture all of the energy available.\n3) An equal balance of form and function - One last rule, but a bit of a segue from the science stuff. If the oven is located in a place you rarely visit, you will rarely use it. If the oven is awkwardly high or low you won't use it. And, if your wood pile and oven are an annoying distance apart, you won't use it. Using a wood fired oven is fun, and everyone is going to want to get involved with the process, so make sure that you have a set up that invites everyone to do just that.\nOkay! Let's get on with the build.", "title": "Hot Stuff! - Building a Wood Fired Oven at Home", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Hot-Stuff-Building-a-Wood-Fired-Oven-at-Home/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "(30) Firebrick 8-5/8\" x 4-1/8\" x 2-1/2\" - Used for the floor of the oven. We got ours from Camosse Masonry supply in Worcester, MA and they cost about $2.15 each\n(20) Red Bricks - Used for the arched doorway. Also got these from Camosse and they were $.80 each\n(3) 50# bags of Hawthorne 40 mesh clay - This is for the main thermal mass of the oven's dome. We ordered this through Portland Pottery Supply in Braintree, MA. Came to $50 total.\n(6) 6 cubic foot bags of perlite - This volcanic rock has a lot of tiny holes in it making it a fantastic insulator, it was used in conjunction with concrete to make a thermal insulator for the base and top of the oven. It is not cheap, but if you want to cook lot's of loaves of bread or a great many pizzas, don't cheap out. We spent $200 total but you will see that it was worth it!\n(1) roll of ceramic insulating material - This was used as a mid-layer insulator to increase the oven's R-value drastically. Once again, not cheap, but worth at about $100. We ordered it from Amazon at this link.\n(4) 50# bags of all-purpose sand - Used to form the dome of the oven and as a base to the firebricks and bought at a big box store for $3 per bag.\n(18) 80# bags of quick setting concrete - Used for the foundation and also mixed with the perlite for the walls of the oven. These are about $4 per bag.\n(2) 80# bags of mortar - Used for building the base of the oven and for the arched doorway bricks.

There really is no way of getting around this. You will need to mix approximately a full ton (2000 pounds) of concrete, mortar, and clay. With that said a small cement mixer isn't such a bad idea. We ended up purchasing one on Craigslist for a few projects we knew we would be tackling in the next couple of years so it was a fantastic investment in my opinion, and my back agrees.\nThe base needs to be set on compacted, level ground. I used a combination of sand and gravel to make a level base for the foundation to rest on. Once it was completely level I built a form for the concrete to be poured into. Our form was 6' square. We mixed up the concrete, poured it in up to the edge of the 2x6's and then leveled it off with another 2x6. We then set the 6x6 anchors into the corners of the foundation so that the concrete could harden up with the anchors in place. I placed a plastic cover over the top of the foundation and gave it a few days to completely solidify. Once it was 100% solid I then removed the cover and the forms and got ready for building the base of the oven.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAW/KLUI/JRQOODHY/FAWKLUIJRQOODHY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQI/A7B0/JRQOODHZ/FQIA7B0JRQOODHZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: A Solid Foundation for Your 2 Ton Beast"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "While your foundation is hardening you can start to figure out how you want to build the base of your oven. We decided to use field stone, which is found throughout the woods here in New England. A good majority of the stone came from the initial tilling of our garden believe it or not. You can use other materials to build your base ranging from pressure treated timbers to cinder blocks. You can use upcycled materials like old bricks, an old galvanized tub, or pretty much anything that will be able to be filled with debris and then topped with concrete. We settled on the field stone since it is both attractive and structurally sound... and was taking up space any how.\nOnce your concrete foundation is hardened completely you can begin building your base. You will need to mix up some mortar for your joints between the rocks. We just put small quantities of the mortar in a bucket and then carried it around the base while we filled the gaps. I would suggest wearing gloves since the mortar has a tendency to remove moisture from your hands pretty quickly and can really do some harm to them over time. With our field stone base we started with the flattest rocks near the bottom to begin building upwards. As we mortared we added additional layers on top until we got to the desired height. Since my foundation was 5-1/2\" high, I made the base go up 29\". Once the second foundation is added and firebricks are added the total height will be right around 40\", which is perfect for my wife and I to put and pull goods in and out of the oven (she is 5'4\" and I am 6'4\" and it works great for both of us).\nWe made the base a 5' circle which was very reminiscent to a well. Once it was completely mortared and had been given some time to set up we began filling it in. The beauty is that you can pretty much fill it in with any solid debris you have around the house. We had recently done a project that required the demo of some concrete and we used the broken up concrete to fill a good chunk of the base. We then used some of the sand and gravel mix we had at the house to fill in the gaps. Leave about 8 - 12\" of space empty near the top of the base so that you can add your insulating material.\nThe first part of this process is pretty darn easy. Open a bag of perlite and pour it on in! Open up the next bag and do the same until you are about 2\" from the top edge of the base. You will cap off the top of the base with an insulating cap made of concrete and perlite. To make the insulating cap you will need to mix perlite and concrete together. This is where a mixer comes in handy since it will give you the most even mix with two seemingly unmixable materials. You are looking for a consistency similar to thick oatmeal with about five parts of perlite to one part of concrete mix. We used enough water to bring the mixture to that oatmeal-thick quality and then spread it on top of the loose perlite in the base until it came to the very lip of the base. Let this harden and dry completely before moving on to the next step.\nRemember, the entire purpose of putting the perlite in the base is to create a thermally insulated area where the actual oven and all of its thermal mass can rest. The perlite and perlite/concrete cap are both plenty strong enough to hold up an oven sized like this.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJM/R8DD/JRQOODIO/FJMR8DDJRQOODIO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXV/VMWB/JRQOODIP/FXVVMWBJRQOODIP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU5/KVPO/JRQOODIS/FU5KVPOJRQOODIS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEZ/WP55/JRQOODIT/FEZWP55JRQOODIT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Is Timmy Down the Well?"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Now that you have the base thermally independent of the oven via the perlite and perlite/concrete cap, you can build the foundation for the oven itself. This mass of concrete will sit directly on the thermally isolated perlite/concrete cap you made in the previous step and the firebricks will sit directly on top of it. Through conduction the firebrick will transfer energy to the concrete oven foundation and then that stored energy will be reradiated back into the oven after you fire it, keeping a consistent temperature during the entire cooking cycle.\nI used 8\" metal flashing that I had hanging around the house to make the circular form and two self tapping screws to attach the ends of the circle together. Use some rocks to help hold the form in place while you shape it and make sure that the form only sits on the insulated perlite/concrete cap, otherwise energy will be lost to the surrounding rocks and base. Once you have your form set up, mix up enough concrete to create a evenly smooth 4\" thick circular slab. The concrete should be a little bit looser in consistency to insure that it evenly spreads around the form and can be poured from a bucket. Use a board and level to make sure that everything is level. If it is not you might need to let it set up a bit and move around the mix somewhat.

Firebrick can go up to very high temperatures and not have any thermal shock issues.\nTo make sure that the firebrick sits perfectly flat on the oven foundation you will need to put a thin layer of sand at approximately 1/4\" thick. Place the firebricks on this layer of sand and carefully tap them with a rubber mallet to level all of the bricks evenly so that there are little to no bumps or ridges. How you set them up is totally up to you, but I feel that the orientation we used worked really well for the size of the oven foundation. Once they are all level you can use a bit of mortar to hold the edges in place, just don't use any mortar between the bricks.\nWhen you build a fire on the firebrick they will heat up, and will transfer energy directly to the concrete foundation, all you need now is some way to trap all that energy and radiate it evenly to the goods sitting on the bricks... enter the oven dome!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7R/YTOF/JRQOODJR/F7RYTOFJRQOODJR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJA/UPCH/JRQOODK5/FJAUPCHJRQOODK5.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: 3... 2... 1... FIREbrick - Installing the Firebrick Base"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "The archway: This part is so much fun and really starts to make your oven look like a real oven. Before you can build your dome you will need to make your brick archway for where you will be sending your loaves to the fiery gates of happiness. I ended up making a form for the brick archway by first setting the bricks up on a square piece of plywood that is the length of the front edge of the fire brick. I formed the bricks in the shape I was looking for, keeping the two bottom bricks perfectly parallel with the bottom edge of the plywood. You do not need to cut the bricks at all to do this, just make sure that all of their interior edges are touching each other. Once you get an arch you are happy with and that fits within the parameters of your firebrick platforms size you can use a pencil and mark the interior curve of your archway. From the bottom flat edge of the arch you are going to want to remove 1/2\" of height so that you can shim the form into place and can remove it more easily later on. Use a jigsaw and cut the arch out, retrace the arch on a second piece of plywood and then sandwich a couple of pieces of 2x4 between the two pieces of plywood using screws to attach them. This will be the form for your archway. Set the form on the front edge of your firebrick and start by placing your first two bricks flat on either side of the arch. Start working up both sides alternating between each side. Use a small pebble to adjust the angle of the brick so that the interior edges touch. Work your way upwards until you get to the topmost brick... then go back through and make final adjustments. I am not a mason, so this took some trial and error, but after at least 100 firings the oven's archway is still standing strong. After you are done with adjusting everything you need to mix up some mortar and pack it into the joints. The mortar will move a bit after it is dried and you fire the oven, it will even crack somewhat, but don't let that worry you, those bricks should stay put if you tried to keep their interior edges touching, or nearly touching.\nBuild the dome: Time to play in the sand! You are going to form your oven's dome by building a big dome out of sand first as your form. You will then cover the sand with newspaper and all of the layers of your oven, then remove all of the sand, leaving your dome in place. We originally made a guide out of plywood to help us get the right shaped and height of the oven dome. Basically, I tacked two nails to a wall with a distance apart equal to the width of the firebrick platform's width. I then used a 1/2\" rope tied to both nails and let the middle of the rope fall to form a catenary arch. I then adjusted the distance the bottom node of the arch was from the imaginary line between the two nails until it represented the height we wanted our oven's interior to be (18\" in our case). I then slipped a piece of plywood behind the catenary arch and traced it on the plywood, took the ole jigsaw out, and then cut out the arch. I used this guide for the initial forming of the dome and piling of the sand and then used it at the end to check my work and make sure I was on target.\nTo begin making your sand form, pour all of your sand into a wheelbarrow and mix water into the sand until it is similar to what you would want to use to build sand castles on the beach. Take your sand/water mix and pile it up on the firebrick using your catenary arch form to adjust the height and shape. Pack down the sand, smooth it out, and then do a final check with your catenary arch guide.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F87/Z6AU/JRQOODK8/F87Z6AUJRQOODK8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIV/3IMS/JRQOODLF/FIV3IMSJRQOODLF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDK/HY06/JRQOODL1/FDKHY06JRQOODL1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCJ/K8NJ/JRQOODKA/FCJK8NJJRQOODKA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNF/0FY1/JRQOODK9/FNF0FY1JRQOODK9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Do You Want to Build a Sand Castle? - Building the Oven Dome and Archway"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Just as the firebrick will hold and radiate and conduct energy into the goods you are cooking, the fireclay dome will act as a thermal mass to radiate energy to the other parts of your food. We made our fireclay layer 4\" thick, so plan on using a lot of clay and spending a fair amount of time on this part of the process. Before you dive in, you will need to use some newspaper as a layer between the sand and the fireclay. This will make the process of removing the sand all the easier and prevent sand from getting stuck in the clay and later falling into your pizza.\nBuilding up with fireclay: You are looking to mix the fireclay with enough water to make something with a consistency similar to stiff modeling clay. Wet enough to pack into a ball and when thrown at a solid surface will not shatter, but not so wet that the ball sticks to the solid surface. You are going to take the clay and make 4\" thick bricks that you are going to place against the newspaper, stacking from the bottom, working your way up. Keep the fireclay on the thermally isolated cap and around the oven foundation (it doesn't need to be as thick around the oven foundation since it already acts as a thermal mass. You are going to keep tacking the fireclay bricks and smoothing them together right up to the very top. You will then need to smooth over and taper the fireclay over the brick archway. Make sure everything is tight and smooth before moving on to the next step.\nDigging out the sand: As long as you got all of your clay nicely layered and tightly butted up against the base you should be able to dig the sand out on the same day you do it. Pull out your archway frame by removing the shims and pulling out the form. Strap on a headlamp and start digging out the sand. Pull the sand into a wheelbarrow and find someplace around the house where you can use it... my kids loved the new sand in the sandbox!

Your nice, smooth, even clay dome is going to crack. There is really no way around it, unless you get lucky. You just made a 4\" thick layer of clay and are going to let it all dry at once... there is just no way to avoid cracks, sorry. But don't fret, it will not effect the oven at all and you are going to cover up the cracks with more insulation, whoo hoo!\nSmall Fires: You want to use small relatively low heat fires with your oven to help dry out the clay completely, but slowly. If you make a big fire in there for the first time you will cause significant damage to the clay and make cracks that actually do matter. Start the fire under the archway. Use kindling cut up and stacked and just keep feeding it for a few hours while pushing it further back into the dome. You can then move up to using larger diameter kindling (4\" wide) and continue to feed the fire while pushing it further back into the dome. You are going to generate a fair amount of heat with this process and you will see the clay steaming quite a bit while the newspaper all burns off. After you have fired the oven for the day you can use some of that stored up heat to make some pitas or pizzas (recipes at the end of this instructable). If you are going to cook with the oven at this point you will need to remove all of the ash in the back of the oven unless you are going to do a live fire (more explained at the end of the instructable). We use a copper pipe to blow the ash out of the stove along with a natural bristle brush to remove the ash. We also use a few different peals to move the pitas and pizzas on and off the bricks (details and plans at the end of the instructable too... oh there is so much too look forward to!). At this point you should keep the oven under cover and out of the elements. Use a pop up tent or something that will not sit on the dome like a tarp (melted tarp and pizza never taste good together). You don't want your clay to get wet again since it isn't really 100% a bisque fired clay... just dried and somewhat fired on the interior.

Bread requires a fair amount of latent heat to be built up in the thermal mass of the oven. That means that you need to store up lots of energy in the oven foundation, firebrick, and clay dome, but you don't want to lose it to the surrounding environment. Insulation is the key! Our first layer of insulation was a ceramic blanket we purchased off of the giant South American river (Amazon). Using scissors we cut it into strips that fit the oven nicely and doubled up the layers to add twice the insulating potential. We then used chicken wire to go over the blanket and act as a mesh for the insulating concrete layer to adhere to. The chicken wire was just folded and shoved into cracks and crevices to keep it in place. This was the easiest step and a truly satisfying step of the process that payed back in dividends in regards to the ability of the final oven to stay at a constant temperature.\nMore bricks and rocks: You will probably notice that there are more rocks added to the base along with some additional bricks. The bricks are just plain red bricks that are thermally isolated just as the rocks added are. They are all mortared together and DO NOT touch the firebricks or oven foundation at all.

You are mixing ten parts perlite to one part of concrete this time, making a kind of sticky-yet-crumbly mixture that will have little structural integrity but will be one heck of an insulator. You need the stuff to stick to itself and to the chicken wire with no problem, so adjust some parts of water or concrete as needed, but try to get as much perlite in there as possible. Do the same thing as before with making clumps or bricks of the material and stacking them along the dome working your way up to the top. Pack it down lightly (don't go crazy, air is a good insulator) and let it dry overnight. At this point you can still fire the oven with no harm to your insulation.

Mix up the Portland cement with sand (directions on back of package) to be a bit looser so that you can easily trowel it on to the dome and then smooth it over the surface with a float. You only need to make this last layer thick enough to evenly cover the entire oven, about 3/4\" thick. This layer will not only make the final product look better but will also act as a decent level of protection for the oven from the weather. Don't rely on this layer only, build something to protect your oven. Speaking of that... let's talk about the structure I built over the oven.\nOven hut: If you remember from the very first step, I made sure to leave space for 6x6 post anchors to be installed at the corners of the concrete foundation. The post anchors were for the main supports of the structure I built over the oven. The design is a modified timber framed design with a dual rafter carriers along the length of the structure sandwiching the 6x6 posts. The rafters are bird-mouthed to fit over the outside rafter carrier and there are purlins attached across the rafters to add rigidity and to give a place for the metal roofing to be screwed down to. The angle braces help hold up the 2' overhang and just look cool too. We have had 65 mph winds recently and the thing does not shudder, it is as solid as the oven itself.\nWhere's the chimney?: We decided against a chimney and we are happy we did. Chimneys are great but they are a place where heat can be lost and in the case of a wood fired oven, that is not acceptable. Yes, you do get a bit of smoke in the eyes during the first few minutes of firing but once your fire is raging the wood will be burning at a temperature that will quickly dissipate the smoke. The smoke with our oven quickly exits the little hut and often can be seen roiling out of the top ridge vent. There is NO fear about lighting anything on fire between the level of insulation in the oven and the distance everything is apart from each other. My opinion is to avoid the chimney, save the time and money, and more importantly, the heat for the bread.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVI/YPVU/JRQOOEKO/FVIYPVUJRQOOEKO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDH/N19O/JRQOOEKI/FDHN19OJRQOOEKI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIU/XC1O/JRQOOEKQ/FIUXC1OJRQOOEKQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC1/UF6R/JRQOOEKM/FC1UF6RJRQOOEKM.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 12: And to Cap It All - the Final Layer and Some Protection"}, {"step": 13, "steps_text": "We use a number of tools to work with the oven and since this oven is markedly hotter than your typical in-house oven, you are going to want to put the oven mitts to the side.

This book has it all! From bread recipes to cooking meats in the oven to how to actually light a quality fire in the oven. We recommend it for anyone interested in cooking with a wood-fired oven. The following recipes are derived from the book with a few added details from our experiences.\nPita Recipe (12 pitas):\nOven temperature - 500F\n350g Bread Flour (3cups)\n350g Whole Wheat Flour (3cups)\n476g Water (2cups)\n2.1g Active Yeast (1/2 tsp)\n14g Salt (1 tbsp)\nTotal Mass: 1,192.1g\nCombine flours and water into mixing bowl until both are completely incorporated and cover allowing 30 minutes to rest.\nAdd the yeast and salt and mix thoroughly into the flour/water combination. Use a dough scraper to help with this.\nTurn the mixture out on to a floured surface and knead it for about 5 minutes.\nPlace the dough in a covered container for 1-1/2 hours to ferment folding once at 45 minutes.\nTurn dough out onto lightly floured surface and divide into 12 pieces and shape into a tight ball placing it seam side down on the surface. Cover them with a cloth and let rest for 20 minutes.\nFlatten each ball and roll it to about 1/8\" thick. Try not to use too much flour to do this, just enough to prevent the roller and dough from sticking.\nPlace the rolled out pitas onto a cloth with a layer of cloth between each to prevent sticking and let them all sit for another 20 minutes.\nUsing a slightly floured peel put the pitas on the bricks. They will puff up within a minute or two and then typically will collapse. Remove them either as soon as they are completely puffed up or just after they have collapsed.\nEat them right away or pile them up under a towel.

The news hit me harder when I realized which foods were high in lectins, tomatoes, peppers, beans, wheat and grains, all of which pretty much ruled out the Italian, Chinese, and Mexican cuisine ~ our favorite comfort food recipes! Unfortunately we had already planted our tomato and herb garden which had just begun to make fruit. Our neighbors appreciated the freshly picked organic tomatoes when we delivered them though.\nThe first few weeks were very difficult because we were in the process of working on our house and I did not have time to find suitable recipes online so I conjured up something; many processed foods contain additives and lectins that are unhealthy. We managed to follow the requirements of the diet but the food was very bland. By fall, I finally went to the doctor with my husband and started asking the doctor a lot of questions about the diet and learned there were some exceptions to the rule. When I learned he could eat some of these things, I almost jumped out of the chair because I decided to go on the same diet to avoid having to make separate meals.\nThis instructable will share how we have reduced the lectins in these foods, so we can eat our favorite tomato soup recipe and bread, beans and peppers ( occasionally) and what we have learned from this journey.", "title": "Low Lectin Tomato Soup Recipe", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Low-Lectin-Tomato-Soup-Recipe/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "We were on the diet for several months and my husband's blood test had significantly improved and he was feeling better and had more energy.

I have arthritis and began to notice my pain level was elevated during this time. We both agreed the diet had been well worth the sacrifice of eating our favorite foods and the recipes I had been making were just as tasty and much healthier.\nI learned a lot from Dr. Gundry who is a cardiologist, heart surgeon, and medical researcher who wrote a book about the lectin diet. He mentions if we pre-soak beans in baking soda and water and rinse the beans under running water and repeat the process several times over a period of twelve hours and cook them in a pressure cooker with baking soda, it would remove most of the lectins. He mentioned several types of foods that could be cooked this way to reduce lectins. I watched a lot of his videos which helped me understand how they have a negative impact on the human body, causing a lot of health issues, including weight gain.\nIf you purchase canned beans, he recommends Eden's Foods brand because the beans are pressure cooked in the can which are BPA-free. Fermentation is another method for reducing lectins in lentils.\nI prefer soaking a large batch of beans and place the drained beans on a cookie sheet like you would berries and freeze them.

This dough is a tad harder to roll out, but I didn't have a single pierogi rip while pulling the dough around the filling.\nWe start by whisking the egg and sour cream together. Then in a separate mixing bowl, add the dry ingredients. If you have a sifter, you can sift your dry ingredients. I do not (forgive me, mom). Next, we pour the egg and sour cream mixture over the flour ingredients and use a dough hook to mix in the mixer for about 10 minutes.\nUsing a mixer is a new thing for me; I just found a cheap Kitchenaid at a garage sale. If you don't have a mixer, or prefer to knead by hand, you can do so on a lightly floured flat surface. I tried to link to an Instructable about kneading dough, but apparently the Instructable community really likes \"no-knead bread\". Sorry folks. Just mix it first to combine, and then smash it a bunch of times into itself until it's smooth and elastic.\nLet your dough rest for about 30 minutes and keep covered with a damp paper towel or plastic wrap. Making dough while the potatoes are cooking works out pretty well.\nOnce you are ready to roll out, you have a couple options. You can roll it out with a rolling pin or use a pasta machine. If you are using a rolling pin only, cut the dough in half or quarters and roll from the center out until the dough is evenly about 1/8\" inch. If you are using a pasta press, you will need to take small pieces of the dough, roll out a flat oblong shape, and stick in the pasta machine starting at the 7 and decreasing to a smaller width each time (I stop at 4 or so). Using a pasta machine takes more time as the sections are smaller, but rolling out to an exact width is easier.\nWhichever method you use, make sure the dough you aren't using is covered to keep it from drying.\nTake your 3\" cutter (or whatever size is a little bigger than your pierogi press if you have one) and cut out the dumpling circles. Remove the scraps and stick back with other dough.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FN6/WSVI/JROTNR4B/FN6WSVIJROTNR4B.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5C/IVUN/JROTONNI/F5CIVUNJROTONNI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG8/HZCL/JROTON3U/FG8HZCLJROTON3U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPG/HGPR/JROTONBP/FPGHGPRJROTONBP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0J/SN1V/JROTONLU/F0JSN1VJROTONLU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCL/P00D/JROTON28/FCLP00DJROTON28.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ5/8IKB/JROTOMZ2/FQ58IKBJROTOMZ2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGR/V6F9/JROTOMVQ/FGRV6F9JROTOMVQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLD/KJ1O/JROTOMQ4/FLDKJ1OJROTOMQ4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA4/S3HW/JROTOMU4/FA4S3HWJROTOMU4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOE/88PG/JROTOMU1/FOE88PGJROTOMU1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4S/UOMS/JROTOMJ7/F4SUOMSJROTOMJ7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPN/ZHCB/JROTOMHJ/FPNZHCBJROTOMHJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0O/DVXQ/JROTOMEA/F0ODVXQJROTOMEA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAS/C4DP/JROTOLWL/FASC4DPJROTOLWL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN5/2PO5/JROTOM7W/FN52PO5JROTOM7W.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Dough"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Start off by grabbing yourself a chair*, some music or tv, and definitely a pierogi-stuffing partner. This is what makes pierogis comfort food - not just the cheese - but the time spent pulled up to the counter making them with family or friends.\n*You'll need a chair because this can take a bit of time. Getting or making a pierogi press (linked on the ingredients page) will make the process fly. Maybe this is why I haven't made one yet...\nFor this step you'll need your dough rounds, a spoon, filling, a dish of water, and a pierogi press or fork.\nTake a small spoonful of your filling and roll it in your hands to smooth it down; I like to make it oblong a bit so it lays better in the dumpling. I dip my finger in the water and circle around the dough, so the dumpling is more likely to stay closed. Then I fold the round into what looks like a taco and begin to press from the top edge out. Get all the air bubbles out of the dumpling as you go, and try to keep the filling out of the edge. You can either go back and press the seam again and add in fancy curled edges, or take a fork and press the edges together.\nIf using a pierogi press, lay a dough round in the press, add a spoonful of filling, and clamp down. Wait... why haven't I bought one of these yet?...\nLay formed pierogi on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper sprayed with oil, and don't let the dumplings touch, as they are prone to sticking.

It's Crown Daisy, also known as edible Chrysanthemum. Shungiku is a slightly bitter leafy green that is often used in Japanese hot pots.

It's also true to my experience that Chinese families don't make dumplings at home daily, not even weekly or monthly, but yearly, usually on the Chinese Lunar New Year Eve. Why? Making dumpling from scratch is at least half day, team work and whole family affair.\nAfter I came to the United States, I hadn't made dumpling once for many years. When my sisters came from overseas to visit me once, we made dumplings, which also awakened my longing for eating it more often. Also my child (only one at that time) liked it so much. So I tried to make dumplings more often, every time after wrapping only a few of them, I lost patience and my family became hungry waiting, I would roll out the dough to four large pieces and made huge potstickers, one for each member of the family. They tasted great. You can see from pictures 4, 5 and 6 in this introduction, they are pies not dumplings. I still needed to find a practical way to make real dumpling.\nDumpling(jiao zi) in Chinese usually means shui jiao(boiled dumpling). There are also steamed dumpling(zheng jiao) and potsticker(guo tie). In the old time, Chinese families didn't have good flat bottom non-stick cookware to make potstickers. They had no other choice but to boil the dumplings. Over time, they became to like boiled dumplings and became good at boiling dumplings which is also the hardest among the three cooking methods. Steamed dumpling(zheng jiao) is popular but second to shui jiao in China. Potsticker is the least popular, some think it's hard to make potsticker, some think it makes a person \"shang huo\"(a common concept in the culture very hard to explain in English), others think potstickers aren't cooked through. I, on the contrary, am crazy about potstickers. I love any food that has charred crispy crust. I found cooking potsticker is the easiest among the three methods and it doesn't require super good seal of each dumpling and it's guaranteed cooked through every single time.\nMaking dumpling involves three major processes: making wrappers, filling and wrapping dumplings. Commercial and many restaurant dumplings are made by machines. After doing some research on how and what the frozen wrapper from store is made of, I decided there is no significant difference in health value between frozen wrapper and homemade fresh wrapper. By using ground meat from store and food processor to chop vegetables, now I can make dumplings/potstickers on weekly basis or on one of the weekend days. If you are like me, having a picky eater at home, dumpling is the best solution for them. With all the vegetables, meat, oils, spices and seasonings in the filling, I feel I can have a good night's sleep after seeing with my own eyes my picky eater eat several of it. After eating a dozen or so of dumplings myself, I neither feel overfull nor want to eat more or anything else.

One-Hour Cinnamon Rolls are one of my favorites because they are ooey... gooey... cinnamon-y... and sweet... plus they are ready in an hour. You have to try these! I was skeptical too, but believe me... these delicious cinnamon rolls won't disappoint.\nNarrowing my decision to just one type of bread was difficult, but I think you\u2019d agree that this recipe is a keeper. The smell, taste, and even the thought of this bread triggers my salivary glands. Like Pavlov\u2019s dog, my mouth begins to water just thinking about these sweet and gooey cinnamon rolls.\nOver the years, I\u2019ve tried several cinnamon roll recipes. This recipe has the perfect amount of cinnamon-y goodness, the dough is soft and tender, and the bonus is that it only takes an hour to make. Additionally, it uses all basic ingredients that most people have on hand. Win...Win! Am I right? Of course I am!\nMy curiosity with yeast bread began at an early age. One afternoon when I was five or six my mom tried to explain what made the dough rise, but my little brain just couldn't understand. It wasn\u2019t until a few years later that I realized that a chemical reaction occurs every time yeast bread is made. The short explanation is that yeast feeds off simple sugar breaking the sugar down into carbon dioxide. That\u2019s the fermentation process. As the dough rises, carbon dioxide is formed which makes the bread rise or increase in volume. For more information, the Kitchn blog does a great job explaining \u201cThe Science behind yeast and how it makes bread rise.\u201d https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.thekitchn.com/th...\nMany serious bread makers might scoff at a \u201cquick\u201d yeast bread\u2026 after all, it takes time to develop the flavors in yeast dough\u2026right? Well... I urge you to give it a try. I played with this recipe a bit, tweaking a few things like the type of fat and the amount of flour, sugar and yeast. After several attempts, I finally nailed it! By letting the dough rest for 10 minutes before rolling it out, this allows the gluten to relax enough to easily roll out the dough into the desired rectangle shape. The dough will be soft and a bit sticky, but it shouldn't totally stick to your hands. If it seems a little too sticky, that's okay. Don't be tempted to add additional flour. After the dough rests, simply sprinkle a little flour on the counter and a little onto the dough and roll it out.

Other recipes were pretty similar; however, this one is on the high side in terms of adjuncts (non barley base ingredients) which is a plus due of the large quantity of pumpkin I had available.\nFor those who have not homebrewed before, I would not recommend this recipe as it involves a significant amount of specialized equipment and familiarity with the process. Although the steps are fairly straightforward, the process is lengthy and certain mistakes can lead to an entire batch being ruined which can be quite costly. There are many malt extract (unfermented beer concentrate) recipes available which require minimum investment in equipment. However, for those who are looking for something more challenging, the procedure I follow here (all grain brewing) opens up a world of possibilities in terms of control over the process and ingredients.\nIngredients (The following are modifications I made or options I chose):\nGrains \u2013 I used 2 row Great Western Malt instead of the recommended 6 row.

Mine is a Monster Mill)\nBrew Pot (10 gallon or larger)\nHeat Source \u2013 straddling the brew pot over two burners on my cooking range is adequate for boiling the wort. Not all ranges produce enough heat so a propane burner or other heat source would be required.\nLadle/ Small Saucepan \u2013 for scooping grains and liquid from the brew pot to the lauter tun. I use a small saucepan because all my ladles are too small.\nLauter Tun (straining contraption I made by following the directions for the Zapap Lauter Tun)\nThermometer (I just use the one on the side of my Brew Pot)\nWort Chiller (bent copper tube that connects to a garden hose to chill the wort or unfermented beer)\nFood Grade Vinyl Tubing \u2013 for transferring liquids from one container to another\nDrilled Stopper/ Fermentation Lock \u2013 for connecting the blow off tube. A popular alternative is a fermentation lock. It is debatable whether it is necessary or not; I have left wort out to pick up wild yeast but the air turned out to be as sterile as a clean room. I have also let beers ferment with just a paper towel covering it without any problems with contamination but maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m in Southern California.\nHydrometer \u2013 checks density of liquids.

It isn\u2019t necessary as the spigot at the bottom of the bucket can be used to control the flow. Even the spigot isn\u2019t necessary since a siphon can be started and the tube pinched when needed to stop the flow; however, I found the bottle filler handy in minimizing splashing of the beer which becomes sticky and hard to clean.\nBottle Capper \u2013 there are two designs: one with two handles that works like a cork opener and one that is a lever. I found the lever design to be more reliable than the other one.\nWatertight Container \u2013 exploding bottles are no joke. Aside from the mess (I know from experience), it's also dangerous.

When that happens, I turn on the burner and stir until the temperature is back where it should be.

It is recommended to raise the temperature at the end of the mashing process (mashout) to stop enzymic activity to help the lautering process (more below) but it is more of a concern for commercial brewers as I skipped this step many times and have never had an issue. One way to confirm the completion of the mashing process is to combine some tincture of iodine and the wort (proper name for the water now that it absorbed the stuff from the grains during the mashing process) and checking the color. I stopped doing it since it was messy (stains everything) and time consuming. Instead I check the specific gravity of the wort at the 1 hour mark to see if it reaches a value around the target S.G. If not I continue mashing until it does so.\nAlso a note on the water: I don\u2019t use bottled or filtered water since I find the tap water to be pleasant enough to drink. If the tap water happens disagreeable or if there is the need to eliminate another variable, go ahead and use bottled water or filter it with a reverse osmosis system. However I have brewed many beers with just tap water which saves money in the long run so give it a shot unless there is something particularly wrong with the water.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGH/U18P/JRBBOIVL/FGHU18PJRBBOIVL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQY/Z9NL/JRBBOIZN/FQYZ9NLJRBBOIZN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F47/T0BF/JRBBOJ0D/F47T0BFJRBBOJ0D.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Mash the Grains and Pumpkin"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "With the mashing underway, gathered the spice mix which is responsible for the pumpkin spice character in the beer.

Transfer the grains into the lauter tun. Filling the lauter tun so that the strainer is submerged under an inch or so of water prevents the grains from clogging the strainer and causing the runoff to be \u201cstuck\u201d. This works effectively in floating the grains (zero gravity!) which is especially important in this recipe as the pumpkin mash is inherently prone to clogging. Place a bucket below the lauter tun to catch the runoff. The flow should be adjusted so that the liquid drains slowly with the liquid maintained above the grains until the end of the lautering process. Sparging involves extracting as much of the residual sugars from the grains by running water through the grains. For this step take 4 gallons of water (I use water warm to touch instead of the recommended 170\u00b0F and have been able to do this step effectively) and rinse the grain in the lauter tun. The liquid flowing out will be progressively lighter in color due to less and less residual content left in the grain. At some point my runoff bucket was in danger of overflowing so I stopped the flow with the spigot, transferred the liquid to the brew kettle (rinsed of the grain residue) to make more room for the runoff.\nTaking the Pre-Boil Specific Gravity\nAt this point I took the S.G. of the pre boil wort to find the ballpark post boil wort. At 1.040, it is lower than the target S.G. of 1.066. However at the current volume of 8 gallons, once boiled down to 5 gallons, the S.G. becomes 1.064.\n1.064 = (8gal/ 5gal) * (1.040 - 1.000) + 1\nI usually compost the spent grain in my backyard.

With the wort chiller connected to a water source, drop the chiller into the brew pot. This process can take a while depending on the design of your chiller and the temperature of the hose water. Avoid touching the wort as it drops below boiling since it is prone to contamination as it nears room temperature. In addition everything the wort now comes in contact with should be sanitized.\nWatching the Temperature\nThe speed at which the wort cools slows as the temperature of the wort approaches the temperature of the inlet water. For me this step took the greater part of an hour. The target temperature is usually listed on the packet of yeast and is somewhere around 68F but I haven\u2019t noticed a difference at higher temperatures (90-100\u00b0F). Yeast doesn\u2019t die until ~130F so the proper temperature isn't that important.\nChecking the Specific Gravity\nThe specific gravity of the wort (Original Gravity) needs to be determined to find the alcohol content. Since alcohol is lighter than water, an increase of alcohol in the solution will lead to a decrease of density. The exact alcohol content is found by taking the difference of the specific gravities of the wort pre and post fermentation. I achieved a value of 1.060 which is 9% less than the lowest expected original gravity according to the recipe. As a result the alcohol content of the final product will be less than expected. The difference could have been due to the lack of boiling \u2013 I had about a gallon of wort left which would have increased the O.G. had the water content been boiled away.\nTransferring to the Fermentation Vessel\nConnect a sanitized tube from the brew pot to the sanitized fermentation vessel. The spigot to my brew kettle has a barbed fitting that is larger than the hoses I have but I found that the O.D. of the hoses have an almost perfect seal when inserted in the I.D. of the fitting. I throttle the flow to a slow stream and angle the outlet of the hose so the wort can contact as much of the air inside the container as possible. Oxygen is neccessary for proper yeast growth and I have found the steps adequate in providing enough aeration. There are many products to assist with aeration but I have found them unnecessary and they seem likely to cause contamination in the beer.

This seems to be more of an issue for lager style beers as ales do fine as long as it is not too cold. I haven\u2019t had any off flavors from fermenting at 80+\u00b0F so feel free to experiment with different temperatures. The temperature for this batch averaged at around 78\u00b0F and changed a couple degrees depending on the time of day.\nMid Fermentation\nPast the initial stage the activity is much diminished. There may be the occasional bubble but the rolling boil of the initial fermentation phase is over. Note that the beer is quite cloudy with a significant amount of solids suspended in the solution.\nFermentation Complete\nAt the two week mark most properly brewed ales are done with fermentation.

For everyone who is not an avid homebrewer with a kegging system, bottles are the way to go. Bottle conditioning consists of adding some yeast food (usually corn sugar but sometimes malt extract) to the beer before it goes into the bottle and capping it to keep the CO2, a byproduct of fermentation, from escaping the bottle.\nPreparing the Priming Sugar\n\u00be cup of corn sugar is adequate for a 5 gallon batch. Reducing the sugar will result in lightly carbonated beer. Likewise increasing the sugar will cause increased carbonation; however, bottles will fail from too much pressure so it is important to ensure the proper volume is added. Mixing 2 cups of boiling water with 3/4 cup of corn sugar ensures the sugar is fully dissolved and that the solution is sterilized.\nAdding the Priming Sugar\nWith the fermentation vessel higher than the bucket, start a siphon and empty the contents into the bucket below. Instead of stirring the dissolved priming sugar into the uncarbonated beer with a spoon, I like to add the solution to the bucket just after the start of the siphoning. Since the priming solution is scalding, having some of the beer in the bucket prevents the solution from melting the bucket. Also the flow coming from the siphon tube adequately mixes the priming sugar with the beer reducing the need to sanitize another item.

This step is called bottle conditioning and is necessary unless a kegging system is used. I do this step in a dark room where I place all the bottles in a watertight container to prevent leaking if any of the bottles decide to explode or if the caps become undone from the pressure. Although I haven\u2019t had a bottle explode in my last batches, it has happened in the past either from overpriming, contamination, or bottling partially fermented beer. From experience this step takes about a week at warm temperatures. Checking for finished beer consists of opening a bottle, pouring it out, and seeing if the carbonation is adequate.\nMeasuring the Final Specific Gravity\nTo find out the alcohol content of the beer, it is necessary to do one final check with the hydrometer. Since density changes with temperature, it is important to cool or heat the liquid until it matches the temperature the hydrometer was calibrated at.

Later, needing to make the Stollen I did a quick search and I came across this web page that describes the process very well. Here is a quick summary:\nPreheat oven to 175F (about 80C)\nPour 2 litres of buttermilk in an ovenproof dish (3 litre size or larger for comfort)\nPlace it in the oven for 2 hrs. After 2 hrs, turn the oven off and leave it over night.\nDrain the quark curd in a cheese cloth or jelly strainer (what I use mostly)\nCheck once in a while that it is draining well.\nScoop out the quark cheese into containers and done.\nI used to use 3 layers of cheese cloth, but now use a jelly strainer as it is more convenient. I use this one. I am sure there are other equally effective methods.\nThe draining process can take quite a while depending on the strainer you use and likely humidity, etc as well. I make double batches and it can take several hours to drain properly. It is no extra work though, since it just sits there on its own.

Mix all the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder and nutmeg) in a large bowl; large enough to hold all the liquid ingredients at some point as well. That large bowl I used is also from my mom. Ensure the dry ingredients are well blended; I like use a pastry blender for this. You can sift them together if you wish, but I have not found it necessary so far.\nAdd the candied fruit, the zests and sliced almonds to the rum-soaked raisins, mix well and have them ready. To the dry mixture add the butter and quark, mix it well and knead it to form a soft and, likely, sticky dough. Add a little flour if it is too sticky to work with and roll it out on the counter. Place the raisin mixture on top and knead it together to make it as uniform as possible. Add flour as required to it isn\u2019t too sticky. Don\u2019t add so much flour as to dry it out.\nThis dough will make a single 15-18\u201d (38-45cm) long loaf. If it is a double recipe, like mine, it will make 3 roughly 12\u201c (30cm) long loaves.

Let me just explain what it is: Povidla are made from ripe fresh plums, the process takes several hours where you bake the fruit and melt it slowly in a pot. The fruit has to be very very ripe and you don't add sugar or really very little. The result is a very thick marmelade kind of mass that is absolutely delicious.

It sounds really odd, but if anything it is far from strange and unwelcoming. Bakso is an Indonesian comfort staple served in street vendors, restaurants and at home too.

Well one most important aspect is that it is made with Beef Surimi. Surimi is basically a meat paste mainly consist of fish; but for Bakso, beef, pork or a combination are used. Surimi also contain cornstarch to give the meatball a naturally spongy springy texture. Not TOO spongy like most commercial packaged meatballs that tends to be slightly tough, but enough to give it a nice chew but still keeping it tender\nAlso, because surimi (fish, beef, pork etc..) is a paste, using a strong blender is recommended to achieve the smooth, non-chunky consistency.

It adds a nice refreshing flavor and aroma to many southeast asian recipes.

Secondly, after it adsorbs the liquid, the bloomed starch gelatinized when exposed to high heat during the cooking process later on.

It is full of flavor and brightens any gloomy day with a bright, rich sauce over browned chicken that is every bit as comforting as macaroni and cheese or chicken fried chicken with a cream gravy.\n\nThe dish originates from Italy and was usually served with veal. Chicken has become quite popular in America. I have put my own spin on it by adding garlic two ways, reducing the amount of lemon flavor, and by adding heavy cream. The lemon and the garlic are wonderful together in this dish and there's enough creamy sauce created to pair the chicken with your favorite pasta.\n\nIf you were watching your carb intake, you could omit the pasta and flour and this dish would be easily transformed into a low carb success. That is one of the benefits to adding heavy cream to the sauce (and the fact that it's awesome).\n\nI hope you will enjoy this recipe. I know I do.

When you season your pan, you are oiling the pan at a hot temperature to better better preserve the pan. This keeps the pan from allowing moisture to rust, or dry out and become brittle or flaky. Cooking with any kind of cooking oil is a great way to keep your pan in good condition. After use and washing, ensure the entire pan is dry- it is raw metal and it will rust!!\nRub a small amount of cooking oil on the cooking surface of the pan, preferably while still warm. This should be done after every wash, and so when you are ready to cook next, the pan is ready to rock and roll!\nCast pans are not nonstick and have no protective coating- this means you can actively damage it if you use the wrong utensils or chemicals in it. Stay away from metal utensils, wooden is an ideal alternative. When cleaning, do not use steel-wool pads or sharp, abrasive scrappers.\nContrary to legend, dish soap is safe to use in cast iron- in moderation. A pan can take on the taste of dish soap- or any flavor- when used a lot or in improper clean up. Use dish soap only when needed, like in a sticky situation (pun intended). Otherwise, hot water and scrubbing should do the trick.\nOccasionally, you may notice some dark residue on your towel when cleaning. This is perfectly safe -- it\u2019s just the baked-on cooking oil reacting to foods that may be slightly acidic or alkaline. It will disappear with regular use and care.\nCast iron pans come in a multitude of volumes and sizes, and work well for most any dish. They fit in an oven or open fires.

Unfortunately we have not liked very many recipes she has given us, especially the bread! The textures were often gummy, eggy,crumbly, and had a long list of ingredients.One time the bread was purple!\nAfter baking several bread recipes he could eat but did not like, I decided to do some research that would help me understand a little more about the diet restrictions preventing him from devouring a tasty bread recipe.

So my first search was to find lectin free grains. Dr. Gundry's website was at the top of the list. I learned as much as I could about which grains were lectin free, sorghum and millet were two that were lectin free as well as gluten free. Cassava flour was recommended as an alternative flour substitute and of course there are coconut and almond flours.\nDr. Gundry says sourdough bread is the healthiest bread you can eat because the yeast is what\u2019s necessary to ferment and destroy the lectins but the type of yeast sold today contains transglutaminase which is very harmful. Here is an article explaining it in detail. Wild yeast contains healthy bacteria that benefits your gut and helps develop the authentic flavor our grandparents achieved so many yeas ago.\nI wanted to make sourdough bread using a grain flour and was leaning towards sorghum because it was listed as a great substitute for rye in texture and flavor and is used for fermenting beverages. I could not find sorghum flour in my town but I did find a bag of whole grain at Farmer's market. It was my best option for the types of flour I could use to make the first batch of sourdough starter and bread.\nI needed a back up flour in case the sorghum did not work out so I decided to try almond,coconut, and cassava flours after reading that most people combine at least three flour alternatives when making a bread recipe because each one has certain characteristics that are needed to help make a good loaf of bread. I did not have many choices to choose from that my husband could eat and the main ingredient would have been the almond flour. I could not find any recipes where someone had actually made an almond flour starter. and I expected a challenge to do so.\nNatural yeast grows in the soil and lands on plants,leaves,and fruit and can also be found on organic red cabbage and red grapes at the grocery store.

Erick gives credit to Debra Wink, a chemist and accomplished baker,in his video for the starter recipe. He has a link to a pdf file that you can download and read how she spent many hours developing the recipe for the pineapple juice method.\nI made the sorghum starter by grinding the grain in a coffee grinder only because it was the best thing I had to use but after making the biscuits I realized the coffee grinder did not grind the grain into a small enough powder and it made the biscuits a little grainy. A seed grinder or vita mix would be a better choice.\nI read a lot of discussions about tap water being OK to use for a starter but I disagree with those people who said this because the statement is too general. It is best to use spring or filtered water. Distilled water is void of minerals which are important in the process of making sourdough.\nI broke off a couple of leaves from the red cabbage to put into the almond flour starter container to help encourage the yeast to grow but after doing this I did not like the results because it was messy and caused the mixture to turn purple.

I also had to consider the different flour replacement and what characteristics they offer for baking bread. Almond flour is heavier and coconut flour absorbs a lot of liquids. As it turned out later on for the final batch, I made the right decisions. I decided to add egg relying on a roll recipe I used for making dinner rolls.The eggs were used to rise the dough and create the texture.\nConsistent room temperature, drafts, and humidity, plays a big part in making bread. A seedling heating pad was suggested on a video I watched on youtube about baking bread. She mentioned it was the perfect temperature to help the starter development and to keep the bread dough at a constant temperature. You can purchase them online for about fifteen dollars.\nElevation plays a part in the length of time your starter will fully develop.\nIn the final recipe I used a large muffin tin because I added the eggs and it made the batter wetter for a thicker cake like batter consistency.\nSome bakers suggested a second rise when making sourdough bread for a more complex flavor profile.

All the recipes I found were very cake like. However, I wanted to make something more like a fried donut but baked in the oven. Fried donuts are made with a yeast dough, something I have experience with. Then I discovered the Instructables Baking Challenge. I decided that I wanted to try and enter with my not yet developed recipe for Oven-Baked \"Fried\" Donuts.\nBut I had a slight problem.\nThe contest deadline was in 6 days.\nAnd I had never made or developed a recipe before.\nI quickly made up a recipe for a yeast dough, guessing on the amounts of all the ingredients. I made the dough, adjusting the amount of flour as I went along. I let it rise, refrigerated it, and then shaped and baked them. They were surprisingly edible! However, they were VERY dense and rather chewy, so I judged that I had added too much flour.\n5 days to deadline.\nI reduced the flour and made it again. The second batch was much lighter and easier to chew but didn\u2019t taste quite right. The dough itself tasted more like a pizza dough than a donut. My main problem was that the dough was not sweet enough, so I decided to try adding more sugar.\n2 days to deadline.\nI started batch three, with more sugar and shortening instead of butter. (I had read a bunch of copycat Krispy Kreme recipes and a lot of them had shortening, so I thought I would give it a try. In the end I don\u2019t think that I could tell a difference between the batch with butter and the batch with shortening.) They were better, but still not quite the taste I want. I decided that I like the consistency of the dough, though I will continue to try and make them fluffier in the future. I only had time to make one more batch, so I decided to add more sugar and add a little more vanilla and salt in the hopes that it would enhance the flavor of the dough. The day before the contest ended I made batch four and took pictures. It worked pretty well! I want to continue to improve it, and if you have any suggestions, I would love to hear them!

You can also watch a video on tossing dough but I\u2019ll confess that they didn\u2019t help me much. It\u2019s all in the practice! You can try rolling it with the pin but the dough might fight back and it will end up being dense.\nHand-stretching dough looks intimidating but it gives you aerated, soft dough.

The Chelsea Bun is no exception, it grew out of a time of upheaval and change in which whole populations were displaced from the Countryside into the Towns and Cities. Enclosure Acts, the Repeal of the Corn Laws and the Industrial Revolution meant that rural dwellers who had once grown, raised and cooked their own food and could walk from their front door to commune with Nature now bought their food at the Pie and Bun Shops and paid half-a-crown to walk under trees in the pleasure gardens.\nNo business was better suited to thrive than the Old Bun Shop at Chelsea in London, at one time famous for its Hot Cross Buns, which had caused a near riot on Good Friday in 1792, when 50,000 people had turned up to buy and eventually 240,000 buns were sold! Hot Cross Buns were only baked on one day of the year, so it had been a stroke of genius to come up with a similar recipe for baked goods, though without the symbolism which made it so popular but that could be purchased on a daily basis. The Chelsea Bun had first been offered for sale around 1700. In 'The Journal to Stella' April 28th, 1711, the Irish writer Jonathan Swift wrote scathingly of this latest craze:\n'Pray, are not the fine buns sold here in our town; was it not Rrrrrrrrare Chelsea buns? I bought one today in my walk; it cost me a penny; it was stale, and I did not like it, as the man said, etc.\u201d\nThe author of Gulliver's Travels however was in the minority, Chelsea Buns were 'in' and the bun shop was patronised by Royalty with both King George II and King George III and their respective wives being enthusiastic devotees.\nSimilarly in 1742 when the Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens opened its gates to the public, just a stone's throw down the road from the Bun Shop, success was assured. As the English writer and socialite Horace Walpole wrote:\n'It has totally beat Vauxhall...You can't set your foot without treading on a Prince, or a Duke of Cumberland'\nAll of which goes to show that there is nothing new under the sun, from fast food to a fascination with celebrities and royalty.", "title": "Chelsea Buns", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Chelsea-Buns/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "This amount makes 9 buns but I am convinced you will need more, even though I have just eaten two of them fresh from the oven, writing this up has made me convinced I will need to revisit the kitchen.\nAll the ingredients I use are organic.\nFor the Dough\n4 cups (455g) white bread flour\n1 teaspoon of sea salt\n3 tablespoons (40g) raw cane sugar\n2 teaspoons active dry yeast\n\u00be cup (170ml) lukewarm milk\n1 extra large egg (or 2 bantam)\n4 tablespoons (60g) butter - melted\nextra flour for dusting\nFor the Filling\n3 tablespoons (40g) butter - melted\n\u00bd cup packed (70g) raw cane sugar\n1 cup (140g) mixed dried fruit - raisins, sultanas, (these I plump up in a little warm water) candied peel (home-made) recipe link at end\nYou will also need an 8\" to 9\" square cake tin 1\u00bd\" to 2\" deep - greased\nTo Glaze or Not to Glaze\nTraditionally Chelsea Buns were covered with a sugar glaze but I find this makes them too sweet for my liking. All I do, is to retain some of the butter and sugar from the above recipe and then brush and sprinkle this on to the buns before putting them in the oven.\nA Foreword on Yeast\nThe reason why these buns are so deliciously rich and yet fluffy and light textured is because of the action of a single celled member of the fungi family; Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As the name suggests this is a sugar-eater, which breaks down grain by the action of metabolising the sugars (both simple sugars and starches) in the flour turning them into alcohol and releasing carbon dioxide gas. The trick to a fluffy sweet bun is to get the CO2 to make the dough rise but not to leave it too long in this state, which would allow for a secondary fermentation and will then give the bun a savoury bread-type tang.\nTo Need to Knead or Not to Knead?\nWheat flour contains two proteins gliadin and glutenin, these combine to form gluten. When we mix our dough the proteins are haphazard and in no particular order, kneading causes them to form chains of amino acids, creating a network within the dough to trap the resulting carbon dioxide and allow for rising. However, as the bun dough rises, the action of fermentation creates heat at the centre of the dough ball. This means that the multiplying yeast cells start to form clusters, alcohol concentrates in one area as do the expanding carbon dioxide bubbles. If this is allowed to continue, then the dough may rise unevenly, pockets of alcohol could overcome and kill the yeast and the cooked dough could contain holes where the bubbles are too big and the buns could even cave in and collapse. Punching down the dough and then re-kneading it changes all that, the alcohol and CO2 are redistributed, as the hot centre and colder exterior of the dough ball become homogenised and the clusters of yeast are broken and redistributed. The action of kneading also enables air to enter the dough. This now allows, once the dough has been formed into buns, for them to rise to a wondrous and even fluffiness.\nYou can make no-knead bread buns but these will both take longer to rise and result in the 'tang' we discussed above.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FC1/LW9D/JQMO5JNN/FC1LW9DJQMO5JNN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIF/21QM/JQMO5JWH/FIF21QMJQMO5JWH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEL/RQ2P/JQMO5K3L/FELRQ2PJQMO5K3L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTP/4HB3/JQMO5L1C/FTP4HB3JQMO5L1C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA1/4AB8/JQMO5L6Q/FA14AB8JQMO5L6Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE0/IQEV/JQMO5G3R/FE0IQEVJQMO5G3R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG8/XS54/JQMO5KD8/FG8XS54JQMO5KD8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Ingredients and a Word About Using Yeast in Sweet Buns"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Temperatures\n400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) - Preheating the oven to this temperature means the yeast is killed quickly, so will not have the potential to over-rise or continue to rise in cooking.\nMethod\nFor the Dough\nIn the colder Winter temperatures we have at the moment, I usually like to heat my flour before I start mixing. I do this by just placing it in a large earthenware bowl at the side of our cooker.\nAdd the lukewarm milk to the yeast and the remaining sugar. Leave until the yeast has started to 'work', you will see a head of foam on the top of the liquid (approximately 5 to 10 minutes).\nMix together the sifted flour salt and half the sugar.\nMake a well in the centre of the mix and pour the yeast mix into it.\nWith your fingers, add just a little flour from the walls of the well to the centre, enough, when mixed with your fingers to form a thick batter. This is called the sponging method.\nLeave for around 10 minutes or until it becomes spongy.\nBeat the egg and the melted butter into the spongy mixture in the well and then incorporate the rest of the flour.\nKnead for 5 to 10 minutes until the dough feels and looks smooth and has a silky surface. I actually favour near to 5 minutes).\nForm into a ball.\nOil the bowl and place the ball in the centre, cover with a damp cloth and leave in the open kitchen away from draughts until it has doubled in size.

Candlemas as the name suggests, is often referred to as a religious festival of light but it does in fact go much further back to Imbolc the pagan festival of the start of Spring. This day traditionally marked a new beginning for the rural populace, when they took down and burned or composted their Christmastide evergreens and got ready to prepare the land for new growth.\nHere in France, we have the tradition of serving a galette des rois on or around new Twelfth Night (5th/6th January). This is mostly a purchased puff pastry pie, usually filled with apple or frangipane. The galette is bought in a paper bag, which also contains two cardboard crowns covered with gold foil or it is purchased in boxed kit form with a pre-rolled pastry round, a powdered mix of frangipane, etc.,. The cake is then served to friends family and/or neighbours, with the slices precut by the host. It is passed around the table and as the cake is eaten the King and Queen of the feast are revealed as they respectively and hopefully espy, rather than bite into, a china f\u00e8ve within their piece of pie.\nMary Queen of Scots was thought to have first introduced the idea of the Twelfth Night cake and the concept of King and Queen of Misrule into the British Isles. As the word f\u00e8ve suggests, the choosing of the 'King', was traditionally made by virtue of a dried bean, a symbol of fertility and Spring and at some time later a pea was included in the cake recipe to designate the 'Queen'. In New Orleans I have seen some beautiful antique Limoges china red beans which were used there for galette des rois. In 1874 a French pastry cook had the idea of replacing the bean with a tiny porcelain figurine, (see above) still to be known as f\u00e8ve and after the first World War, Limoges began to mass produce these for commercial and home-made galette. This tradition, of picking a King and Queen and also of incorporating a fancy dress element, continued right up into the Victorian period, when packs of character cards or inked paper prints were sold to be used with the cake during Twelfth Night parties. Guests would assume the character as dealt them in the cards. These were usually of a satirical nature as the names suggest, in fact much along the lines of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night players; Sir Toby Belch and Sir Andrew Aguecheek.", "title": "Twelfth Night Cake Baked in a Paper Hoop", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Twelfth-Night-Cake-Baked-in-a-Paper-Hoop/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "As I don't have a tin big enough, this was my first attempt at baking a cake in a 18th century 'Garth' or Cake Hoop of thick brown paper, organic cooking parchment and string to hold it all together. As it was so successful, I shall be using this method again but maybe also try a wooden garth, which we can fashion from fruit crate wood.\nI made enough mixture for one round or square, deep cake of 8 \" or 23 cm diameter. I actually ended up making a 10\" or 25.5 cm diameter hoop, which gave me a shallower cake that cooked more quickly but was still as succulent.\nThe outer hoop was a double thickness of brown paper cut from the inner of an empty 25 kilo organic sugar bag, I get these from my local organic shop. The hoop was lined with a double layer of organic baking paper and the base also. I did not cut an exact circle for the base but made it a double sheet that could be pulled up the sides of the hoop. I also added an empty loaf tin in the gap to the side of the hoop, as my base tin was rather large. This was occasioned by Andy asking me if the mixture would leak out!! It didn't. As you can see from the photos above all that happened was the outer paper received a little butter from the base paper, as I buttered this beyond the circumference of the cake hoop!\nI then left the cake to cool in its paper hoop overnight. This is not a necessary cooling time but it was 2 am!\nTable for Hoop Size Diameters\nTo calculate the hoop size you will need from the weight of the cake:- above is a chart I used from an old cookery book, I also converted it to metric rounded up to the nearest usable fraction.\nOven Temperatures and Times\nPre-heat the oven to 150\u00baC or 300\u00baF, I'm cooking in a wood cooker so this does have what Mrs Beeton refers to as 'a good soaking heat'.

I find it makes them much more digestible anyway.\n200g or 7 oz raw cane sugar\n4 eggs - separated into yolks and whites\n60ml or approx 2 fl oz of alcohol - I'm using rum and red wine.\n1 teaspoon of mixed spice ('mixed spice' is a traditional British pie, pudding, biscuit and cake blend, made from, ground coriander, cassia, ginger, nutmeg, caraway and cloves)\nTraditional Method of Mixing With the Hand\nFirstly, the butter and sugar are creamed (incorporated) together and actually the best method of doing this is literally by hand. This way not only does the warmth of the hand make the sugar and butter much easier to cream but it also means you can feel when the mixture is smooth and mixed to an optimum.\nThe whites of the eggs are then whisked into 'a strong froth' (I took this to be to meringue level) and I slowly incorporated them into the butter and sugar.\nThe beaten yolks and then the flour and mixed spice come next. Mrs Beeton, who lived at a time when many country people, particularly women, were drawn into towns and cities to become servants, suggested that the cook should now mix the cake for '\u00bd hour or longer'. Being my own mistress, I skipped that bit!\nThe dried fruit and alcohol is now added to the mix.\nI then spooned the cake mix into my paper hoop paying attention to press it lightly but evenly into the whole area.\nThe cake was then placed in the oven and I checked it after two hours.

This is because someone's labour has been involved and my local organic shop has a mission statement promising fair wages and profits to the producer. This is how it should be, I have no problem with that and so I chose to make my own as my time and labour are for free!\nThe other potential difficulty I can see with these recipes is raw egg. For me this is no problem as we raise our own poultry in an organic forest garden environment and on a 100% organic diet, which includes fruit vegetables and in season, a great deal of invertebrate protein. I would suggest that if you don't raise your own poultry, then you do what we do with buying raw milk, find a local organic farm and visit it and meet the farmers. This way you will see at first hand, exactly how the birds are raised and thus how you feel about eating raw eggs. This is how we all used to live, in close contact with our food and its production.\nAlmond Paste\n1 egg white, beaten to a 'strong froth' (I take this to mean meringue level).\n100g or 4 oz of blonde unrefined cane sugar - ground to a powder. (As mentioned above you can buy organic icing sugar but it is so easy and cheaper to make your own).\n100g or 4 oz of powdered almonds\nA teaspoon of rum or whatever you used in your main cake\nI started by adding my egg white to the powdered almonds. I did this a spoon at a time.\nThen I added the sugar. Our cane sugar is kept with vanilla pods so already has an added depth of flavour. Having added the rum, I started to gather the mixture up into a 'dough'.\nThis I then kneaded into a ball and rolled out on my board using a little powdered sugar to stop it from sticking.\nI then slid it onto my cake and following Mrs Beeton's advice placed it for a few minutes in my oven with the door open to allow the almond icing to dry and harden.\nRoyal Icing\n170g or 6oz of blonde unrefined cane sugar - ground to a powder.\n1 egg white, beaten to a 'strong froth'.\nA little raspberry liqueur for colour and taste (ground organic sugar is light brown not the dazzling white of non-organic, plus the traditional Twelfth Night Cakes were pink!) If you want a deep pink, dried hibiscus flowers, steeped in warm water make a wonderful colour.\nLemon juice\nFor decoration\nAs this is Imbolc, I added a few fresh violet leaves and flowers, the only plant that is actually blooming in our garden at the moment!\nI used a liquidiser to make the sugar into a powder, be aware of lifting the lid too quickly before the dust settles! I also needed to run my fingers through it just to test that it was fine enough.\nI had also added a couple of squeezes, approximately 1 teaspoon, of fresh lemon juice to the sugar before I added it to the egg white. I then added the raspberry liqueur, this was an experiment and I am happy to say it was so delicious and redolent of sunny days that I was pleased to be my own cook and thus able to scrape out the icing bowl all to myself!\nOnce I had spread the icing on the cake I again placed it in the oven, with the door open to harden. Mrs Beeton has a great tip in that if you ice the cake whilst still warm, once it is cooled then the icing will be set.

Make sure each has at least a few choco chips, and add more on top. You may notice that your dough's getting some cracks on the top. That's perfectly okay! No need to worry, because those cracks will help you bake the cookie evenly.\nThere are two ways you can shape cookies: short and wide or round and small. I like making them round, but you can do it the other way too if you want to.\nHere's a tip: if you're having difficulty moulding your dough, make it into a small ball like the one in the picture (I'm sorry for the bad quality, I took these at night), and then press them flat against a surface.

My recommendation is keep baking them again for 5 minutes at a time after 15 minutes if they're underbaked, and keep doing this until you get them like the one above. You're done!\nBonus: How do cookies bake?\nWell, the baking soda that you put in your cookies is actually something called Sodium Bicarbonate. This breaks down in heat to form carbon dioxide in the equation:\nNaHCO3 \u2192 Na2CO3 + H2O + CO2\nThe carbon dioxide gas makes the cookies rise, while the heat causes the flour to harden up. In the end, you'll end up with little air holes when you bite into the cookie, which gives them the characteristic texture.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSU/YHY7/JQKU0NV0/FSUYHY7JQKU0NV0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Baking the Cookies"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "When you buy your chocolate, it's going to be in a hard bar.

If it does, you've gone overboard with your baking powder.\nBonus: Brownie science!\nBrownies, unlike cookies, don't rise. When you mix milk and flour, protiens in them make gluten, which makes brownies elastic, or 'fudgy' and 'chewey'.

Cooking the dough allows the water to steam out. Another mistake I made was adding the entire egg mixture. I found that the entire egg mixture made my dough too wet. When adding the eggs, add them slowly and test the thickness of your dough. The dough should feel stiff, but flexible -- not as thin as pancake batter!

It takes a little bit of time to get but it will happen! I promise.\nAfter the 10 min rest period...\nHere\u2019s how to form your dough balls from the risen dough, before they rest for a second rise:\nCut a piece of dough 70g from the large mass and fold its edges under to create a smooth outer skin on top of the dough ball. Place the dough ball, seam-side down, on an un-floured surface. The stickiness of the dough on the work surface will be your friend here. Palm the dough with a slightly cupped hand (there is a kind of tension created on the dough ball between the palm and the sides of the hand). Pushing down on the dough ball, roll the ball round and round under the palm, using the cupped sides of the hand to keep the ball centered under your palm. This will create surface tension and \u201cstitch\u201d the bottom seams together. Don\u2019t be surprised if this takes more doing than seems reasonable. Check the bottom of the ball as you work to be sure the folds have been incorporated and have disappeared. Now you have a homogenous ball of dough, ready to rise again.\nShaping dough balls video\nAnother shaping dough balls video\nOnce you have formed your dough balls, let them rest and lightly wrap the baking sheet with plastic wrap. Leave on counter and come to room temp. Soften some butter in your hands and spread it on the surface of the dough buns.\nI make only six conchas at a time. After shaping all the dough balls I freeze whatever I can't eat with in a day. Set them on a baking sheet and put them right into the freezer. They should freeze in about 4 hours. After 4 hours put them into a freezer zip lock bag and keep them in the freezer no more than 3 months. You can do the same with crunchy topping. Just roll the topping into a ball, cover with plastic cling wrap and stick into a freezer zip lock bag. Now every time you crave a concha or have a pot luck or dinner to go to, just make some conchas!
