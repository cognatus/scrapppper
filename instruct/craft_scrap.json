There are a lot of substitutions you can make for tools, but each tool makes the job easier!\n+ Ruler/straightedge - there's no substitute for a good ruler and straightedge. I like mine to be clear, so I can get the most precise cuts I can.\n+ Knife - I use an X-Acto knife, and sometimes just a single sided razor blade. The X-Acto does a great all-around job.\n+ Pricking irons - this tool makes the holes that the stitching will join. An awl and ruler can substitute, but the even spacing in the pricking irons makes it much easier to get consistent spacing.\n+ Groover - this makes grooves to tell me where to put the stitch holes. Can be substituted with a pencil and ruler, but the groover makes it so much easier!\n+ Contact cement - this acts as glue to hold to leather together during stitching, but also prevents the edges from separating during normal use. Not necessary, but helps things look nice.\n+ Needles and thread - I use between 2 and 4 needles, and waxed polyester thread. Definitely necessary!\n+ Beeswax and burnishing tool - Edge burnishing essentially polishes the edges of the wallet, and makes it look refined. Beeswax keeps it together and looks even more shiny!\n+ Mallet - I use the mallet to hammer the pricking irons through the leather.\n+ Leather - This is Chestnut Buttero leather from Conceria Walpier in Italy.

The needles are threaded through the hole, and then that needle pierces the thread about an inch from the end. This holds the thread on the needle during stitching without a knot.\nTo begin, I pull one needle through my first hole, and make sure the thread length on either side is equal (pics 2, 3).

I hope you are excited to get started with weaving!\nToday, you're gonna learn a technique called coiling technique. One of the four main basketry waving techniques. Also known as African weaving style.\nI am Ana and I'm the person behind this instruction. I am very excited to introduce you to this technique!\nCoiling technique is an easy technique to follow, especially if it is done in one color. By following it, we are going to make a continuous spiral that is going to be the basic form of our brooch.\nTo get started with weaving this brooch you're going to need very few materials and approximately 2.5 hours. You don't need a loop!\nMATERIAL:\nsynthetic rope,\nraffia,\na needle,\na lighter\nbrooch needle,\nand beads of any kind you like.\nA ROPE: The brooch is not supposed to be very big, that's why the rope shouldn't be very thick. The thickness I suggest is 6-7 mm so we can form 3.5 rounds of a circle, ending with the with of a spiral of 5 cm. Sometimes the end of a rope can be very messy. Before starting, cut the end of the rope and heat it with a lighter around the edge. The heat is going to melt the long threads and make the end a bit harder and less messy.\nA NEEDLE: The needle you are going to need is any needle with a big eye but if you are not so careful generally, please, avoid needles with a sharp ending and instead use a needle without it.", "title": "Brooch Weaving", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Brooch-Weaving/", "section": "craft", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "To start a spiral take the rope and place it on the table. It is good to sit at the table while you're weaving in order for your hands to have more space and can move freely backward and forward.\nTake a piece of raffia and put its end 2-3cm inside the rope, opposite of the end of the rope. Now, start wrapping the rope with raffia going from you and to the front until you wrap 5-6 cm and can form a small spiral. The spiral should be big enough so you can easily hold it. Pay attention as the shorter spiral has a tendency to unroll and is very difficult to hold. In the beginning, you are going to feel tension and spasm in your fingers but be patient, after you secure your spiral it is going to be much easier to maneuver it.

For securing a spiral you need a little bit of patience in the start.\nHold the spiral with your left hand ( if left handed), the raffia should be hanging down from the outside edge of the spiral.\nPut raffia string, from underneath, in between the first, outer circle, and the middle one. Now raffia is in between two circles of the spiral. Go over the middle circle to the middle hole of the spiral. Then, from underneath, go with the needle up, again in between these two circles. After you go up and over the outer circle you are going to appear in the same position as when you started securing the spiral. Now, from underneath go with your needle up, in between the circles. You have formed number 8 around the ropes. This is going to be our security stitch. If you feel that the secured point is not enough strong repeat the 8 stitch. If you are satisfied, just go over the rope out from your body and you will appear in the same position as when you started securing the spiral.\nNow, we will continue the 8 stitch as many times as possible, not in the same spot but going from the outside in the center and from the center towards you and back. Repeat this many times and you are slowly going to see the difference in how strong the spiral became.\nOnce when you are satisfied with the result, go to our starting position from this step, and continue wrapping the coil. You will probably need to wrap 6-7 times. Then it will be the time for another 8 stitch to secure your spiral.\nAfter every 6-7 wraps, you will do the 8 stitch.\nTIPS:\n-when you start making your spiral maybe the rope is going to be seen in the middle.

Depending of the thickness of the yarn, I use between 2 and 6 threads. The ideal amount in my opinion is 3 strands of DK (like DROPS Karisma). I needed to feel in my hands what quantity worked well, and I tried to get that feeling for warp and weft of each square. Then, my only concern was about colors.\nI dived into my stash of old school, ugly, lablelless balls of yarn, and made boxes by color. I had only one rule when weaving for this project : use only one color for the group of thread composing the warp/weft, or not too contrasting colors.\nWeaving those squares is a great memory for me. First, I chose the colors for warp and weft, with a little universe in my mind. I then warped the loom with the first color, and finally I looked the colors mixing together while weaving. It is comtemplative and very concrete at the same time, the perfect combo for me. One square is done in half an hour after a bit of training. Finished squares carry all the vibrations I felt when thinking of my universe of colors. It is very difficult for me to stop touching them, watching them, comparing the choices I made for this or that square... I find it irresistibly fascinating.\nIn the beginning, I was weaving only for colors.

Here they are :\nThis method will allow you to join and bind off at the same time.\nWith 6.5mm needles and DROPS Eskimo, pick up and knit 21 stitches along one side of a square. Knit 5 rows. You have now 6 rows (or 3 ridges) of garter stitch, with right side facing you. Take the square to join and place it ahead of your work, wrong side facing you. In other word, the two squares are right sides together. Insert your right needle into the first bound off stitch from the square to join, then into the first stitch on your left needle. Knit one stitch through the two stitches, the one from your knitting then the one from the square to join. You got one stitch on your right needle.\nRepeat : *Insert your right needle into the next bound off stitch from the square to join, then into the first stitch on your left needle. Knitone stitch through the two stitches. There are 2 stitches on your right needle. Pass the first stitch over the stitch you just worked. There is one stitch on right needle*.\nRepeat from * to * until there is only one stitch remaining on the right needle. Cut the yarn, pass the end into the loop and pull to secure.\nJoin the twelve square of one stripe into a long stripe, do it for the twelve stripes. Then, do the same to join the stripes together. Pick up 21 stitches per square and 3 per garter stitch border (one stitch per ridge), which makes 285 stitches to pick up along one stripe.\nI also added a border of 6 ridges of garter stitch (12 rows) around the whole blanket.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMR/YDB5/JTCSOUH0/FMRYDB5JTCSOUH0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA6/JI1E/JTCSOU5A/FA6JI1EJTCSOU5A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUX/79E1/JTCSOXV7/FUX79E1JTCSOXV7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Joining the Blanket Together"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Because this project wasn't enormous enough, I decided to line it with some white polar fleece.

It lead to me getting a few amazing pieces of wood, and following the project to make a pendant. I knew I wanted to use the other pieces to turn into my own version.\nNow, that is where it got a bit tricky. I wanted to use wirework, but everything I thought of felt like a mismatch to the material. Again and again I came back to the original project, rereading the introduction. Most important for me was to be able to come up with a design that fit the original thought behind it, yet also putting my own style into it.\nSeeing the remix contest pass by sparked the concept again in my head. Out of nowhere, I knew what to make of it - two circles, of which the inner one could spin around. Yeah. So, I sawed out a rough shape, took a piece of sanding paper, and went outside to enjoy the weather while sanding the outer ring. While walking, I realised how interesting the slight curve of the material was, and a new concept was born - using it in a bracelet rather than a pendant, fitting against my arm, some macrame for the bracelet.

As an artist, inventor and engineer, I wanted to do something new and innovative, something that I could show her when she's older and tell her how much she meant to us! We also had friends and family in 5 continents, so it had to:\nStand the test of time. ( So she could see it when she grows up! )\nNeeded to be small and flat enough to fit in standard postal envelopes.\nIt needed to be post-able without making security alarms going off on every conveyor belt!\nIt needed to be sturdy enough to withstand the stress of an intercontinental postal journey.\nI wanted it to be unique, not a greeting card you can buy from any grocery store.\nI wanted it to be interactive ( have some sort of user input )\nI wanted it to narrate some sort of story\nIt needed to be cheap to build as I was kind of struggling ( financially ) at the time!\nAt the time, I was in Paris, waiting for my papers to flight to St. Louis and join my pregnant wife! while there, I participated in a Hackathon and won an incubation prize-pack that included a two-month membership in a cool Maker-Space called Usine IO ( IO Factory ) which was truly like a candy-factory for me! with all sort of manufacturing machines available to members! I would be staying in Paris though, for only a couple more weeks max! so I had to start right away! I decided to go with my first idea and make a mechanical card, with user input, that would fit in an envelope and last forever!\nThis ended up being a very cool and lovely project, just what I needed in the difficult times of being stranded in Paris, away from my family and dealing with stupid bureaucracy!\nIt was such a great project that I thought, once I settled and more stable, I will share it with others! so I documented all the steps and took photos and videos, and, when, finally, was leaving the country, put the hard drive with all the documents, carefully, in my back-pack and jumped on the plane,... later-on, when I attempted to start writing the story and the making-of, the hard-drive did not work! it was saying that it's not formatted and was making a funny noise! all very sad signs of a corrupted hard-drive!\nLong story short, I lost a ton of photos and videos and documents and memories ( not only this project but also captured moments of good, and bad times during the last couple of years! ), What was left was the stuff that I've shared on social media or those that were backed up on the cloud, which was, only the last part of the project!\nAnd this is it!

I had, however, a ton of experience with design tools and technics, both in 3D and 2D, I know how a laser cutter cuts, technically, and was a master at using drawing tools to produce Vector files, I knew Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, and Corel-Draw, inside-out! Not only, how to use them, but how to make them work! I used to develop plugins for some of these tools!\nSo converting my sketches to precise Vector graphics, without losing precision when converting from one tool and format to others, was a breeze. There were times when some of these tools were not playing nice with others, and I simply opened the SVG file and edited some attributes manually to fix the conversion (especially from Illustrator to Inkscape, I remember, there was an issue ).\nThe process was pretty simple, import the sketch and use it as a background image with reduced transparency, draw the Vector are in the preferred tool ( AI in my case ), then export / convert to the Inkscape format ( which was the format accepted with the Laser Cutter Machine at Usine-IO ), double check the measurements and the color-codes and adjust/fix the values accordingly.\nThe laser cutter machine at Usine-IO was a really good one, you could send a file in multiple colors and ask it to treat each color differently, so for instance, Red could mean cut with a higher power (cut-through), blue could mean cut with a lower color ( more like a vector etch for text or marking ) and Green could mean Raster etching! so the idea was to put everything in one file and have the machine to pass through the design 2 times, once ( and first ) for etching graphics and once ( and second ) for cutting, which was very important decision as it would make the manufacturing process much much easier by eliminating the need to re-align the laser head in different passes and resulted in much more precision over-all.\nGears:\nAt first, I was intimidated by the physics and maths of designing gears! so my first approach was to use 3rd party design tools and plugins to design gears with correct ratio, tooth and what not! but it was a nightmare! the free ones weren't as sophisticated as one would hope for and the commercial ones were either expensive or were completely limited in trial mode. so I did a bit of research, found out what makes good gears ( the angle of attack, the number, and thickness of teeth, the ratio and what not ) and tbh, not only it wasn't that complicated, I also enjoyed it very much!\nSo I ended up designing the gears from scratch in Adobe Illustrator, I would draw a circle with desired size, divide it to desired segments, extruding/beveling each other segment and smoothing out the edges, I would leave a tiny space in my design, so the teeth wouldn't fit perfectly in each-other ( Thought that may cause the system to lock ), and everything worked out beautifully! I was thinking I can introduce a bit lubricant to make things smoother, but even that wasn't necessary! It also gave me the option to make prettier and lighter gears, reducing the overall weight and letting me to cut some of the other elements inside the unused space of the larger gears.\nSo don't be intimidated by the amount of literature going around designing gears and moving elements and mechanical physics! most of that stuff is to perfect things and some of it may not have any effect on anything at all, except for satisfying a university that paid a Joe to produce a paper about that thing! As an insider, I can tell you that a considerable amount of these paper, may actually, be completely wrong! and for the most part, that's a normal and expected thing!\nTLDR!\nBack then, there weren't a lot of free and good tools to generate gear designs, nowadays, however, a little googling will yield more promising results! for instance I found this website very interesting and easy to use ( https://geargenerator.com ), give it a try! .. there are also other ones just Google, or DuckDuckGo, or whatever!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPN/1T7G/JTWSDV5H/FPN1T7GJTWSDV5H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMP/RUHH/JTWSDR39/FMPRUHHJTWSDR39.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN0/LH8Q/JTWSDQV8/FN0LH8QJTWSDQV8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6B/GWIM/JTWSDS0R/F6BGWIMJTWSDS0R.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Converting Raster Sketches to Vector Designs."}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "At the time, Usine had four laser cutter machines, two big ones, and two smaller ones.\nTurned out these machines are very popular and are booked very often! this turned out to be a problem, each of these machines has a different level of precision, power, and calibration and having to switch between them make pieces that are not compatible with each other. Also, depending on the time of the day, the settings needed to be different! What would have made a clean cut on the first batch, 8 in the morning, would over-burn the edges by 4 pm!\nThe other big issue and the one that took the most time to overcome was, design-adjustments to accommodate laser features and characteristics. As I said, this was my first experience with Laser and soon I learned that lasers are extremely good at following certain cuts and designs but they struggle with some others, For instance, it would be much easier and take much less time and create much less vibration, for the laser head to follow a curved angle comparing to a sharp corner, even though that curvature adds computational complexity to the design.\nAlso, I learned that over-all, the calibration errors are more pronounced as the head gets farther from the zero origins, so, no matter how small the error margins of a machine is, it's always worth when the head is the farthest from Zero base.\nAlso, if you are getting weird shapes, like a slightly elliptical circle or if the start and end of a closed path do meet, before anything else, check if your medium is secured well enough to the base ( usually a honey-comb or a metallic grid ), I used small magnets and metal weights to prevent the medium to move around when the powerful laser head makes rapid moves around the machine ( shaking everything! )\nAnother pro-tip would be to think about the movement of the head when designing your path, for me, this saved a lot of time and made the cuts way more precise. The thing is that, depending on the material, the heat produced by the laser may make the material expand, shrink, deform or bend a little bit, and if you have many passes at the same region this may make the effect more dramatic. keeping this in mind when drawing your lines make a much cleaner and more precise cut. It also helps the machine to manage the smoke and fumes better ( by distributing the amount of smoke at a given time ), again, resulting in cleaner and more consistent cuts and reduces the burns and mirror damages. An easy workaround for this problem is to use multiple stroke colors in the design, each for one pass of the head and assign all of them to the same power, speed, and cut settings ( only to force the head to cut a color first, then the next and so on, to distribute and dissipate the heat ). believe me, this helps a ton!\nThere are some other common sense design decisions that you may have to make knowing how the laser cutter works, for instance, if you have multiple nested complete cuts (closed paths shapes inside each-other) of material ( which is great to save both time and material ), you can't send them all to the machine and expect it to go through them in the right order. If the machine cuts the outer shape first, the piece may fall into the tray and not be there when the head decides to start cutting the inner shapes! again, as a simple workaround make different stroke colors and make the head to start from the inner-most shapes to the outer ones.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNB/PYV5/JTWSF9YR/FNBPYV5JTWSF9YR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCH/V9YZ/JTWSFA31/FCHV9YZJTWSFA31.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCE/GW8Y/JTWSFA30/FCEGW8YJTWSFA30.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUB/TRK8/JTWSDW63/FUBTRK8JTWSDW63.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F75/D0VY/JTWSDW66/F75D0VYJTWSDW66.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F12/U3SB/JTWSFA5Y/F12U3SBJTWSFA5Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F57/GQSM/JTWSDVO7/F57GQSMJTWSDVO7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFN/FA1B/JTWSDVL0/FFNFA1BJTWSDVL0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2X/17NM/JTWSFA4G/F2X17NMJTWSFA4G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXA/1VDC/JTWSDWA5/FXA1VDCJTWSDWA5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3F/A2BR/JTWSDVU6/F3FA2BRJTWSDVU6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTY/68BS/JTWSDWA3/FTY68BSJTWSDWA3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Trial & Error With the Laser-cutting Machine!"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Making the design simpler / more minimalist:\nAs an architect, I learned to love simplicity!\nI tried different designs with different mechanical movement principles, including a planetary gear system ( which I produced as a different project to create a limited edition business card! ), I also tried different mechanisms to transfer circular motion of the gears to linear motion for the heads.\nThe final design consisted of 7 gears, used to transform the movement in different directions and two slotted and routed shafts used to convert circular motion to reciprocating motion. The gear ratio was designed to make the movement smooth and user-friendly. I also exposed part of one of the bigger gears and used it as the user-input to engage and power the system.\nReducing the thickness:\nFirst I used a 4-millimeter thick acrylic sheet for the outer layers and a 2-mm thickness for the inner layer.\nI also had the outer layers etched and carved, each 1.5 mm, to create a housing for the inner layer ( the gears ) so the overall thickness would be 8 mm, but after a few experiments, I decided to use 2-mm sheets for everything and eliminate the internal carving entirely, committing to an overall thickness of 6 mm. this turned out to be a very critical decision in the success of the project as it reduced the design and manufacturing complexity and made the design more error tolerant, saving the project, as, after the final batch-cut, I realized that there was some inconsistency in the thickness of the sheets which would have caused serious problems during assembly with the previous layout.\nReducing the Layers:\nAll the rotary elements ( the gears ) were put in one layer, there was only one small shaft extending from one layer to another ( to convert the circular motion to reciprocating one ). if the thickness was not a concern, the ideal design would need to have 6 layers. I eliminated half of the layers by embedding their functionality in other layers with two tradeoffs, first one was that one of the outer layers would need to have a moving element ( not attached to anything ) that would fall out! I fixed this issue with a simple solution, I put transparent scotch tape on top of the moving element, putting another layer of the tape on the side and only masking the exposed parts that were facing the moving part ( so it wouldn't stick to it! ).\nThe other issue was that the heads ( that were moving back and forth, giving little kisses to each-other! ) ended up with no layer at all! which looked actually pretty cool, making the visuals more interesting and letting me reduce the overall size of the card ( as the heads, now, could extend outside of the card boundaries when farthest from each other ), with the tradeoff of making those elements more exposed and in-risk of breaking during the shipment. My workaround for this issue was to make the attachment of the head to the slotted square the weakest link ( connected with very little glue ) so if there were any parallel stress ( which is not very likely to happen in an envelope ) the head would detach from the shaft, rather than breaking, and this, indeed worked, and between all the delivered copies, there was only a one case (to my knowledge) were the head was not connected, and even in that case, the receiver figured they just need to glue that back!\nIn the original design, there were also two additional, paper thick, layers, cut from slippery plastic sheets to reduce the friction between the layers ( and also for visual aesthetics ) which were eliminated in the final production ( for the most part! ) as it wasn't really needed!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FY8/5A8H/JTWSDZQJ/FY85A8HJTWSDZQJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8R/GGXB/JTWSE049/F8RGGXBJTWSE049.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBU/88F3/JTWSDZYL/FBU88F3JTWSDZYL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAC/RL5H/JTWSDZUZ/FACRL5HJTWSDZUZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIK/NFH5/JTWSDZXP/FIKNFH5JTWSDZXP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDX/OI2K/JTWSDZQP/FDXOI2KJTWSDZQP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSL/JOEB/JTWSDZRM/FSLJOEBJTWSDZRM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7G/D4T5/JTWSDZVV/F7GD4T5JTWSDZVV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTA/X3E3/JTWSDZRL/FTAX3E3JTWSDZRL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Perfecting the Concept!"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "I spend 80% of this projects time on pre-production, and that was the best thing I could have done! because of that, the manufacturing and production of the final batch was a joy!

I instead, booked my time at 10:30, and hoped nobody would decide to get out of bed earlier to come and laser cut stuff! and that turned out to be right, but even that wasn't enough time to cut and etch everything!\nI ended up, going 2-3 days trying to use any single minute the machines were available to finish my job, the most difficult thing saw to calibrate the machines ( as I had to use different ones ), but by the second day, I figured ways to do that very quickly and efficiently as well! I decided to keep pieces cut by different machines separately though, as I thought ( correctly ), the laser beam itself may not have the same exact size in two machine ( due to calibration differences or different brands/build and capabilities of tubes with different powers ) which added a bit of time and complexity to the next step, which was the assembly!\nIn this final batch, I used only 2 mm sheets with two different colors, dark (for the inner layer) and light green ( for outer layers ), I also cut a couple more sheets just in case some of them had issues ( which they did! as an architect/engineer you should know that everything that can go wrong, will go wrong! ), I also had the gears tagged/numbered in my designs so I could use the exact gear that was cut in its exact place, which helped a lot to make things work together ( remember in one of the steps I said the error margin increases as the laser head moves away from the origin? If you use the components that were cut close to each other with each other, you can work around those errors, since the two components close to each, both will have, almost, the same amount of error, which reduces the margin of error between the two by factors of magnitude. in the other hand, if you use 2 components from two opposite sides of the cut medium, there you'll have the largest amount of difference/error )", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSU/EJ77/JTWSE5CN/FSUEJ77JTWSE5CN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCZ/EPD7/JTWSE53D/FCZEPD7JTWSE53D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FI8/1FEV/JTWSE59M/FI81FEVJTWSE59M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQM/O17U/JTWSE54P/FQMO17UJTWSE54P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F83/N9PT/JTWSE55N/F83N9PTJTWSE55N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBD/L5NU/JTWSE564/FBDL5NUJTWSE564.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3S/OIVM/JTWSE57W/F3SOIVMJTWSE57W.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Cutting the Final Batch"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "IMHO this may be the part that often gets the least amount of attention and causes the most amount of effort, cost and time in the manufacturing and prototyping.\nI knew that it's not going to be an easy task to assemble everything and because of that, I had this step in mind from the very first steps, especially during the design process I thought about assembly and designed the components in a way that I could make jigs for them to be able to place and assemble them fast and efficient but also very accurately!\nAnd that's what I did!

Being a research facility my office had electrical cable trays located throughout the ceiling. They looked like monkey bars set into the ceiling. It appeared to be the perfect habitat for a Sloth since they like hanging around and make very little commotion -- perfect for an office setting.\nSo Saul the Sloth was born. As most sloths do he moves very slowly. In fact so slow that no one sees him move from place to place but you know he moves since during the week he makes his way to different parts of the office. Some think he may be a bit nocturnal as he seems to move more at night. It has been fun to have Saul the Sloth around the office and to see where he gets moved to. Its a nice addition to liven up the atmosphere of the office.\nSaul the Sloth is made by printing a full-size image onto multiple sheets of paper that are mounted on foam core board with two wire hooks added to let him 'hang around'.", "title": "Saul the Sloth - 'Hanging Humor'", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Saul-the-Sloth-Hanging-Humor/", "section": "craft", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Materials:\nPaper\nFoam core board\nSpray Adhesive\nWire Coat Hanger\nMasking/Painters' Tape\nPaint Stir Stick or Ruler or Section of Yardstick (You are willing to sacrifice)\nScrap Cardboard\nPens - Broad Black and Fine-point Gray\nTools:\nRazor Knife\nPaper Cutter (You can use scissors if you have a steady hand.)\nWire Cutters\nHot Glue Gun & Glue Sticks\nGloves\nComputer with internet connection and Printer", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F04/RMWX/JF34ID6T/F04RMWXJF34ID6T.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Materials and Tools"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "We need a large sloth!

Despite all of the wonders, I'm going to focus today on the most basic of weaves: tabby, or plain weave. Most woven fabrics consist of two yarn components, a warp and a weft. The warp is generally the longer of the two, and is often held under tension on the loom. The weft runs perpendicular to the warp, and can incorporate materials with less tensile strength or that may be less conventional. In a tabby weave, the weft crosses the warp in a pattern of over one yarn, under the next yarn, over, under, over, and under throughout the width of the piece. This creates a balanced fabric with similar stretch along both the warp and weft directions. Changes made to the over-under pattern of the warp and weft creates the vast anthologies of weaving patterns that exist today.\nThis tutorial will focus on the use of a pin loom or other four-sided looms. Pieces made on these looms can be used as they are, often loved as coasters or hot pads, or combined together to create larger pieces, such as blankets, garments, or stuffed toys! My primary use of these squares has been as a sampling tool for my floor loom projects, which allows me to test different yarn, different densities of warp and weft, as well as color arrangements and palettes.\nA modern pin loom has pins along four sides of a frame, though every fourth pin location is skipped, creating a gap. Other looms will not have this gap, but the weaving is working just the same by skipping a pin on any other loom. Personally, for my sampling projects, I like having the non-pin loom because it allows me to easily adjust the number of times the yarn goes across in both directions. Your experience with any style of loom is of course personal to you, and I encourage the use of whichever style best suits your needs!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FB9/1U9U/JTWS3ZZ0/FB91U9UJTWS3ZZ0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: An (Very Brief) Intro to Weaving"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "A woven tabby square is done in four layers, the first three of which are strung layers placed one on top of the other, and a fourth woven layer which is actively woven among the previous three layers. The warp and the weft are each done in two halves, with each layer being constructed of alternating yarn and space between pins. By using this alternating pattern, this technique basically does 75% of the work for you.\nWhen thinking about the layers in the context of the tabby weave, this first strung warp layer will become all of the warp threads that will go over the fourth woven layer.\nAs you are stringing the warp and weft yarns across the loom, try to ensure that there is light tension on each of the strands and that the tension is consistent across the loom. In this style of tabby square, the goal is to have the tension of the warp and the weft be as similar as possible. The tension can be checked by gently pressing on several strands at a time to check that none have more of less give than their neighbors.\nSteps:\nSecure the warp yarn to one corner of the loom, generally this is the left corner closer to the weaver. Depending on the loom, this can be done in a variety of ways. Some looms offer a notch to slip the yarn into, a slip knot could be used around a pin, a loose knot around the frame, or a long loop that makes the first two warp threads. For my loom, I zig zag between extra pins that extend beyond the first corner.\nString the warp yarn from the furthest left space on the closer side to the furthest left space on the further side.\nLoop the yarn around the pins to the right and place the yarn between the second and third pin, leaving a gap space between the two spaces with the warp yarn.\nString the yarn to the space two pins to the right of the first yarn on the opposite side. Again, leaving a gap space.\nRepeat steps 3 and 4 across the full width of the loom. For the sake of this tutorial, the ideal is to end with the tail yarn at the opposite corner of the loom than where it started. Looking at the side of the loom from the outside, there should be alternating loops of yarn and gaps.\nPull the yarn around the outside of the pins at the far right corner. On a pin loom, this would be around the two corner pins and into the furthest top space on the right side of the loom. On my loom, this loop goes from the first gap above the corner into the first gap below the corner along the right side. This creates a loop around the corner that turns the warp yarn into the perpendicular weft yarn.\nOptional: Color changes between the warp and the weft yarns can easily be done at the corner. Tie a square knot to join the two yarns at the outside apex of the corner before proceeding onto the next step. Color changes can also be done in the middle of a step by knotting yarns to the outside of any side of the loom. For short color changes, I have carried yarn across multiple pins, but this does change the typical edge of the pin loom style square that may make it more difficult to join together with other squares.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOW/4FSD/JTWS3Z13/FOW4FSDJTWS3Z13.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWH/W4UM/JTWS3YZE/FWHW4UMJTWS3YZE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAE/6U61/JTWS3YXB/FAE6U61JTWS3YXB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHS/1KLE/JTWS3YWQ/FHS1KLEJTWS3YWQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Layer One: Warp One"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Layer two is worked almost identically to layer one, except that it runs perpendicular to the first layer. Before or after rounding the corner, many tutorials will suggest rotating the loom one direction or the other. In my experience, I may rotate the loom one direction initially, but will always rotate it into a \"home\" position where I am stringing the yarn away from and toward me, moving from left to right. I encourage you to experiment with your loom placement to find a position or positions that work best for you.\nI will use my home orientation to continue with these instructions, but remember that right will always be indicating moving away from the starting corner.

We will also be cutting our yarn, which can seem a bit intimidating because of needing to make sure you have enough to complete the project. However, it is easy to estimate! To ensure that I have more than enough yarn, I loosely drape the yarn across the loom the same number of times that I went back and forth on the first weft layer before cutting the long tail. Depending on the size of the loom, this can get to be quite long, so if it is necessary to join a second piece of yarn to shorten the working yarn, that can be done using the same method as described for color changes in layer one.\nSteps:\nCut a long tail of yarn and thread through a sturdy needle. Craft stores carry a variety of options that can be used for a needle, included weaving needles, doll jointing needles, or simply long darning needles. Any sturdy needle that is easy to handle will work just as well for this purpose.\nAlign the needle with the second furthest left space on the closer side of the loom. Using the needle, guide the weft yarn so that it goes under the layer one warp and over the layer three warp. This weft yarn should be going over and under the warps in an opposite pattern to the first weft layer. Finish the row by guiding the needle through the second furthest left space on the further side.\nLoop the yarn around the pins to the right and place the needle between the second and third pin from your first weft yarn of this layer, leaving a gap space over the space where the layer two weft yarn was placed. This is identical to the pattern used in the layer three warp layer.\nWeave the weft yarn across the loom, following the same under layer one warp and over layer three warp pattern described in Step 2. Continue until the needle can be guided to the space two pins to the right of the first yarn on the opposite side.

If the weft went over the last warp yarn, go under the first two warp yarns, then return to the over-under pattern used for the final weft yarn. This will secure the tail yarn. This step can be repeated with the tail yarn from the beginning of the square. Any other tails throughout the project can be woven in in a similar manner. Alternatively, ends can be left free and used to sew pieces together later.\nThere will be some shrinkage as the tension on the yarn is released, allowing the yarns to relax over and under one another. This loss is called take-up in the warp, and draw in in the weft. When using squares for sampling, this is a very important factor to take note of. Additionally, if the squares are intended to be part of a larger project, it can be beneficial to wash the pieces.

When wrapping the thread, pull it taut enough that it will not easily slip out of position (a bit of slide when pushed is ok) but also not so tight that it distorts the hoop. Don't worry if the spokes are perfectly evenly spaced. There should be just enough give to be able to push them back in place and a bit of unevenness won't be noticeable once you begin the weaving.\n1. Cow hitch knot the thread onto the hoop. Leave at least 4in/10cm for the short end of the thread to make a loop for hanging the hoop at the end. You can always trim it away at the end if you change your mind. Push the knot to the back side of the hoop. Rotate your hoop so that the cow hitch knot is at top. Make sure the cow hitch knot is secure and won't come undone. Feel free to knot it with an overhand knot (like doing a shoelace), but the cotton thread should have enough friction with itself to not unravel.\n2. Now bring the thread down so that it is now on the opposite side of the hoop. Also bring it so it is in the front of the hoop. Wrap it under the hoop, then bring it up to about 1 inch/2.5cm away from the right side of the cow hitch knot, bringing the thread back to the front.\n3. Now, with the thread in front, wrap it around to the back again, passing under the threads, and coming up and over the hoop about 1in/2.5cm to the left of the previous thread (position 2).\nAlways follow this pattern of passing the warp thread from the back of the hoop, under the crossed threads, then bringing the thread to the front of the hoop to wrap it around to the back when crossing.

The roving is what makes the puffs in the hoop.\nRoving is probably too thick in it's default form for the 8in/20cm hoop. We can thin it out by gently pulling from one end and stretching the fibres apart. Be careful not to pull it too thin or pull it apart completely.\nSwitch in the roving as you would any material and weave as normal. For roving and chunky yarns (or just a lot of yarn) you might find it easier to just ball it up and use your hands rather than the needle. On the \"over\" parts of the weaving, leave a loop or puff of roving. Don't pull it tight like the yarn. Leave a bit larger of a puff than you want, as when you weave more layers of roving or yarn, it will compress a little.

Don't cut with scissors as roving won't behave as nicely for weaving in the ends in the back if you do.\nI did a single circle of yellow roving, end with one extra puff to prevent a gap, then I wove more green to secure the roving into place.

It is time to complete the spaces you left between the half-hitches rows.\nTake a piece of the yarn of your choice, the length you want (it's not a problem to attach another piece of yarn if these one is too short to weave the whole space so don't worry about that).\nThere are many ways to weave your yarn, each way create a different pattern so you can play with it to make different parts in your wall hanging.\nI started with the basic weaving technics but first, let me teach you or remember you, some basic vocabulary of weaving.\nWoven cloth is formed when parallel yarns (or cords in our case) that are held taut are interlaced by a second yarn. As a unit, the taut yarn is called the warp; individual yarns (also called threads) are called warp ends. The yarn that travels over and under (or weaves) between the warp ends is called the weft; individual weft threads are called picks. Woven cloth is made by interlacing the warp ends with weft picks.\nAs I said earlier, there are many weaving patterns you can use on your work, but the most common is the basic weave pattern is a simple over and under pattern (the weft yarn passes alternately over and under the warp ends to weave cloth).\nYou can make up your own variations of the basic weave by changing the number of warps you weave under and over, for example:\nover 2, under 2\nover 1, under 2\nover 2, under 1\nYou will be surprised by the designs you can create with these simple patterns and combinations. There are a number of textural and decorative stitches you can add to your weavings. Here are a few of the most common.\nSOUMAK STITCH (illustrated in picture)\nSoumak stitch uses a continuous weft thread that loops around a group of warp threads, traveling from one stitch to the next, to create a raised texture or ridge. It reminds me of hand embroidery. A single row of soumak weaving creates raised slanted stitches. However, when you weave two lines together, slanting them in opposite directions, then something exciting happens\u2014it creates a braided effect.\nI mostly used this stich because I love the braided effect it gives.\nHow to do:\n1-Fold over the end of the weft yarn by 2 in. (5 cm). Tie this loop to the first warp thread on the left-hand side using a Lark\u2019s Head Knot. Begin working in the direction of the tails (moving from left to right). Tuck the short tail to the reverse side of the weaving.\n2-With your fingers, lift up the next two warp threads to the right. Pass the yarn underneath these two warp threads and then pull up to the left side of the weaving once more.\n3-Draw the stitch down toward the completed weaving.\n4-Lift up the next two warp threads to the right and tuck the yarn under again. Tuck so that the weft travels over four warp threads and back under two.\n5-Continue in this way until you reach the last warp thread. Adjust the size of the stitches as you go, if necessary. You will see that this creates a stitch that slants upward to the left. (Soumak stitch always slants in the opposite direction to the one in which you are working.)\n6-When you reach the end of the row, wrap the weft once around the last warp thread.\n7-To complete the braid with the slant going in the opposite direction, you will need to weave another row of soumak stitch. Lift up the next two warp threads to the left. Pass the weft over these two threads, then tuck the weft back under the raised warp threads toward the right again.\n8-Continue across the row, as you did before, so that the weft travels over four warp threads and back under two. The new direction you are working in changes the direction of the slant. To finish, wrap the weft once around the last warp thread on the right and tuck it to the back.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5R/78SJ/JTONBJ20/F5R78SJJTONBJ20.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPD/3GV4/JTONBJ6Z/FPD3GV4JTONBJ6Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIT/0IFU/JTONCFCG/FIT0IFUJTONCFCG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 14: Filling the Hole : the Weaving Part"}, {"step": 15, "steps_text": "Once you have the full line of double half-hitches, we have an extra string hanging over each side.

I even made my own version with braided yarn as a small child, though they were more coaster sized than rug size.\nI rooted around in fabric bureaus, boxes, and bins to find quilting cotton remnants that I thought would work together to create a cohesive color scheme.

I used a few scraps of muslin to test the best way to go about creating finished edge strips. What I ended up with were three inch torn strips that I folded and ironed to hide those dreaded raw bits. To start ripping, I would clip the edge of the fabric with a pair of scissors to start the process, and then tear along the entire length of fabric. This also ensures that the strips are on grain.\nOnce three of these folded strips of cotton were ready to go, I stitched the ends together, and started braiding.\nWhen I came to the end of a strip, I would add another by stitching a torn strip to the short end, right sides together. That strip would then be taken to the ironing board to fold into a finished strip of cotton, ready for braiding.\nI just had to remember to add my next strip of fabric while it was still long enough to reach from the sewing table to the ironing board.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F52/RU23/JTENGRX4/F52RU23JTENGRX4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO7/QU66/JTENGTI6/FO7QU66JTENGTI6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUA/0XM4/JTENGS28/FUA0XM4JTENGS28.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4Q/QBLA/JTENGT8L/F4QQBLAJTENGT8L.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ8/6SDX/JTENGTBT/FQ86SDXJTENGTBT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Preparing the Strips"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "My trusty sewing basket was used as a sturdy anchor point, which made it much easier to braid the pieces together.

I was expecting that I would have leftovers, but I ended up using the entire three yards for this rug.\nWhich means that I used up six yards of cotton scraps for the second and third strands of the braid.\nIt also made me reevaluate some of the tiny scraps of fabric that I have been hoarding - there is a limit to how useful micro remnants can be, and if I save every bit of cotton I will not be able to maneuver around the sewing room at all.

When harvesting flax or grasses cut from the bottom:\n\nThe (flax) plant is seen as a family.

Natural materials can be really awkward and difficult to work with! For this reason I started off my weaving with some wool. I didn't want to buy any so went with the most inoffensive colour I had....I figured it would be covered by the fringe I was planning and is a good way to show the basics of weaving!\nStart by cutting yourself a longish piece of your chosen thread onto your needle (or popsicle stick in my case). This thread is your 'weft' - the threads that are pulled through the warp. There is a LOT of jargon associated with weaving!\nSlide to dowel down to create a shed (the space between the warp threads).\nSlide your needle through the shed from left to right - straight thru the gap. You may need more than one take to get through if you cannot reach all the way, but make sure you are staying inside the shed and not catching other threads!\nPull the thread through till you have a small tail on the left side. We will tuck this in later! Use a fork to press the thread down against the carboard so it is snug.\nRaise the dowel back to the top of the loom to flatten the warp out and using your needle weave back from right to left picking up each alternate thread. You want to start so that your thread will wrap around the last warp thread when it is pulled tight You can see in the picture above that the first weft sits on top of the last warp thread, so I started my weaving by going underneath that warp thread. Continue until you get to the other side.\nPull the thread through. Once it is sitting against the right hand warp thread but not pulling it inwards (you may need to pull it back so it is sitting right - we dont want our warp warped!) hold the weft and the right hand warp thread and pull the loose end of the weft thread (on the left hand side) down to create an arc. Use the fork to press it down into the weave. Making an arc rather than pulling the weft straight through stops you from making it too tight and pulling your warp out of shape :)\nRepeat until done!\nCongratulations! You are a weaver!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRR/FSX3/JTIYKF16/FRRFSX3JTIYKF16.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVU/SMEV/JTIYKF30/FVUSMEVJTIYKF30.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8E/N19N/JTIYKF4Q/F8EN19NJTIYKF4Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB0/AB6D/JTIYKF5A/FB0AB6DJTIYKF5A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYN/NLA4/JTIYKF7A/FYNNLA4JTIYKF7A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F81/75H4/JTIYKF8L/F8175H4JTIYKF8L.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Weaving: the Basics"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "I wanted to hid the wool that I started off with and the bark I found was perfect for a thick fringe at the bottom of this piece.\nCut a whole bunch of pieces of whatever you are using for your fringe.

Most things you find may not be long enough to weave back and forth using a long piece like you would with wood or thread. Here is how I dealt with each circumstance.\nSingle Length strands\nSome of the materials I had only just reached from one side of the warp to the other. The sections of palm leaf I had I threaded through and left the ends poking out. This worked at the bottom of the piece because I was trying to make it look all wild and fluffy round the bottom! If you don't want pieces poking out you can either fold them back and try and tuck them into the warp at the back (can be difficult with the stiffer leaves) or trim them off once you are finished - not too close to the warp though!\nMore Than Single Length Strands\nSome of the longer pieces of the bark fibre were about 2.5 times the width of the warp , so I could go across and back, but on the third pass it finished in the middle. If a piece does not stretch all the way across you can end it midway by making sure the end pokes out the back. You then thread a new piece onto your needle and start threading your new piece in so it overlaps a little with the old one. The ends can either be left, or tucked in with a needle later.\nNot Quite Single Length Stands\nThese tended to be the bulkier items like the pampas grass fronds and the evergreen leaves. In both cases I made sure I was on a left to right weft so I didn't need to thread these pieces in manually. I found a couple of pieces that would stretch across nicely, and wouldn't make too much of a lump in the middle, then slipped them into the shed - sometimes one from each end.\nGaps and Beating\nIn every case you need to use your fork to beat the weft down so that you don't end up with gaps. I found the green palm fronds were very reluctant to be beaten down and then proceeded to shrink so I was left with a couple of spaces in the final product! Something to keep in mind when using green materials...\nWarp Colour\nYou may notice that the warp changes colour part way though my weaving. I did this using a normal teabag with a bit of hot water on it - wait for it to steep a bit then dab or carefully rub the teabag on the warp threads where you want a darker shade.\nWarp Spacing\nThe other issue I encountered with the natural fibres is that they don't naturally 'slide' into the warp. They grab a hold and drag that warp threads all over the place. I was constantly (with varying states of success) using the fork to drag the warp back into nice even spaces. The dowel at the top helps with this because it is always nice and even at the top!\nAs you weave make sure you are leaving yourself enough room at the top to tie off the warp.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F2L/ZPU3/JTIYKFBN/F2LZPU3JTIYKFBN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBI/S533/JTIYKFC7/FBIS533JTIYKFC7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKV/5Y3N/JTIYKFCR/FKV5Y3NJTIYKFCR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKF/UUIA/JTIYKEOD/FKFUUIAJTIYKEOD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8T/JFQZ/JTIYKFDX/F8TJFQZJTIYKFDX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOS/UF1F/JTIYKEKJ/FOSUF1FJTIYKEKJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3L/8TDS/JTIYKELV/F3L8TDSJTIYKELV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXL/QHWZ/JTIYKFDC/FXLQHWZJTIYKFDC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDS/F147/JTIYKFHB/FDSF147JTIYKFHB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Weaving Your Art"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "There are a couple of things to do once you have finished weaving in order to complete your piece of art.\nTying off\nThis is to stop the weaving from falling apart.\nGently slide the cardboard out from the bottom of the loom and slip the warp threads off the nails.

I actually tied two loops together - wasn't as neat, but with the fringe at the top it didn't matter too much.\nOnce knotted you can snip off the loops - unless you want to use the ones at the top for hanging.\nTying in\nAll the loose ends need to be woven into the back of the weave. You can use a needle (a proper one - your popsicle stick may be to big for this!) to poke the threads thru the warp at the back, tucking the ends out of sight. As I mentioned previously the chunkier ends might have to just be trimmed as close as you dare.\nTucking in\nI collected a bunch of little twigs and bits of seaweed that I tucked under the warp threads where I wanted them for added colour and texture.\nHanging\nYou can use all or some of the top loops to hang your piece.

It's a stretchy black synthetic knit with a metallic foil finish on one side, and it matches the fishscale fabric I used to make this mermaid dress. My friend sent me a huge piece of it because she rocks, and I decided to use some of it to make this swimsuit cover-up I'd had in my head for a while.\nMy idea was that I'd use fabric strips to weave a tube that was large enough to fit around my whole body, kind of like one of those Chinese finger traps, and leave a couple of strips longer than the rest so that I could use them as straps to hold the dress up.\nSince you end up with a tube, it has no front or back, so you can spin the dress around to make the straps fall wherever you want, and therefore you have a bunch of different options for how you style the straps.\nYou can vary the length, width, and number of fabric strips to change the size of the dress, or even use this method to make a top or a skirt. I will give you all of the measurements that I used, and you can use them or modify them to make a dress of your own!\nNote: This isn't really a beginner project... stretchy fabric can be hard to work with if you haven't used it before. And swimwear fabric in particular is pretty slippery. But I'll give you all the tips I can, and if you don't feel like you're ready to work with stretchy fabric yet, you can practice by using strips of upcycled denim jeans to make a bath mat using the same method. Denim is a lot easier to work with, and readily available. If you do the denim thing, you need to use a size 16 sharp needle (it might be called a size 100 regular, depending on where you live, or it might even be called a jeans needle. They're all the same thing) instead of the stretch needle I'm using for the swimsuit fabric.", "title": "Swimsuit Cover-Up Made With Woven Strips of Fabric", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Swimsuit-Cover-Up-Made-With-Woven-Strips-of-Fabric/", "section": "craft", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The fabric I'm using is a black poly/spandex knit with a metallic foil finish on one side. It's very stretchy, and was made for dance and swim wear. If you're making a dress that's not for swimming, you don't have to be as choosy about the fabric, but it's important to note that the completed dress will be a cylindrical tube, and whatever you use needs to stretch enough that you can get in and out of it, and still have it conform to your body in a comfortable, flattering way.\nYou can absolutely use two different fabrics to make the weave pattern even more pronounced, but they should be similar to each other in thickness and stretch, so that they aren't fighting with each other once you put them together into the dress.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0X/0GHC/JTIYNWEY/F0X0GHCJTIYNWEY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Choose Your Fabric"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "If your fabric only stretches in one direction, you should cut the strips so that they are stretchy from side to side, and not down the length of the strip. I used a little less than one yard of 60\" (150 cm) wide fabric, but my fabric was very stretchy in both directions. For a fabric that only stretches in one direction, I would recommend buying at least a yard and a half, so that you can cut long enough pieces to make the straps.\nMost of the strips that I used were 4\" wide by 29\" long (10 cm by 74 cm), and two of them were 58\" long, so that I could use the extra length as straps to hold the dress up. I used 14 strips in total: 7 that slanted to the left, and 7 that slanted to the right. I ended up with a tube that was 28\" in circumference.\nThe basic formula is (strip width) times (the number of strips slanting in each direction) equals (the width your finished panel will be). So, 4\" X 7 = 28\". You probably want the width of the finished panel to equal at least the measurement around your waist. But your fabric might be more or less stretchy than mine was, or you might prefer a looser or tighter fit, so I can't give you exact measurements, only that general guideline.\nIf you wanted to change the size or length of the swimsuit cover-up, you can make the strips wider or use more strips, and that will give you a larger dress. Make the strips narrower, or use fewer strips, and that will give you a smaller dress. You can use longer strips to make a longer dress, or use shorter strips if you want to make just a top or a skirt.\nYou need to have the same number of strips slanting in each direction. So if you want a wider panel, you have to add two strips: one that leans left, and one that leans right.\nYou may want to cut 4 of the strips longer, so that you have more strap options on the finished dress, and you can always trim off any that you decide not to use.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ8/1DX0/JTIYNWJC/FQ81DX0JTIYNWJC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXS/7F4L/JTIYO6MZ/FXS7F4LJTIYO6MZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Cut the Fabric Into Strips"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I recommend laying out all of your strips and weaving them together without gluing or sewing anything at first, to make sure that the garment will end up the right size once you are done.\nI laid out two strips to begin with, the long ones that were going to become the straps. I ignored the extra length for now, and pretended that they were only as long as the other straps. I made an X shape with them, and placed them with the ends 6\" (15 cm) away from each other. Add strips parallel to the two long strips, going under-over-under-over the opposite strips in a basic plain weave. If the previous strip went under a crossing strip, the next strip goes over, and vice versa.\nThe bottom points were all aligned along a straight line (the edge of your table works great.) I made sure to line up the bottom points, and not the top, because I was planning to leave the bottom edge of the skirt with the strips hanging free, just like they were woven, and hem the top. So I wanted the bottom edge to be evenly lined up, but I wasn't really worried about making sure the top edge looked tidy yet.\nRandom note: When I was starting to work out the pattern, my goofball brother photobombed me. So to pay him back, I'm putting the photo in my Instructable. lol\nWhen you're done, measure across the center like it shows in the last picture, and measure around your waist.

You do want to use a ballpoint (stretch) needle, or you may end up with skipped stitches. I'm using a size 11 (which may be called size 75, depending on where you live), but if your fabric is thicker you can use a size 14 (aka size 90).\nI sewed all of the seams from the right side (the top, pretty side of the panel), about 1/4\" (half a centimeter) away from the edge of each top strip, to attach it to the strip it was crossing over. I used a straight stitch, but a zigzag would be a good choice too. Sew in reverse for a couple of stitches at the beginning and end of each seam, to fasten your stitches in place.\nI chose to start with two strips, sew one seam at time, and then lay the dress out flat again and work on the next seam. You may decide to weave together all of the strips at once, and then sew every seam one right after another. That might work out well with a less-slippery fabric, but it didn't really seem practical for the fabric I chose.\nI decided to use this temporary spray adhesive to spray each strip that I was about to sew, to make sure it stayed exactly where I wanted it while I was sewing. Again, if your fabric isn't as difficult, you might not need to do this, but it's a helpful tip to use if you run into trouble with the fabric shifting. The adhesive makes your fabric tacky, like the sticky part of a post-it note, and then disappears on its own in a few days, so you don't have to worry about globs of glue hanging around or gunking up on your needle.\nSpray only the part of the strip that will be covered up when you lay the next strip down. You can use pieces of paper to protect the rest of the strip and your table from overspray. You don't want the part with the adhesive on it to be against your presser foot or the bed of your machine, because of course it will stick to them.\nA couple of times I had a space-out moment, and sprayed the adhesive on the wrong side of the fabric strip. When that happened, I put strips of paper over the sticky area to keep the fabric from sticking to the presser foot, and sewed through the paper and fabric at the same time. Then I tore the paper away after I'd finished sewing the seam. But it's easier to just pay attention in the first place. :-)\nP.S. The link to the spray adhesive is an affiliate link, so I will earn a small commission (at no extra cost to you) if you use that link to make a purchase. I'm recommending that one in particular because that's the brand I actually use, and I've never had any issues with it being gunky when I'm sewing through it.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FX3/YVAW/JTIYONT4/FX3YVAWJTIYONT4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2N/1CY9/JTIYONZK/F2N1CY9JTIYONZK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUM/SLS8/JTIYMDD9/FUMSLS8JTIYMDD9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8D/ZMYK/JTIYONV9/F8DZMYKJTIYONV9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Sew the Strips Into a Panel"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Once all of the strips are added and fastened down, you should have some loose ends hanging off to the sides of your woven panel.

Just weave and sew them like you did with the other strips, and they should all fit into each other perfectly.\nThe last few seams will be a tiny bit more difficult to sew, since you're working with a tube now, instead of a flat panel. But just take a second each time before you sew, to make sure that you're not catching the bottom layer in your stitching and sewing the back of the tube to the front.

(Tie them together before you wrap them around your neck, or else it will get uncomfortably tight around your throat. Knotting them together first puts all of the pressure on your shoulder instead.) Or tie them together behind your neck and make halter straps. You can criss-cross them, or twist them. It's up to you.\nYou can also pass them over your shoulders and sew them to the other side of the dress, like tank top straps.

I have divided the poster into 4 basic layers with a gap of 10 mm between each layer. so that gives me a width of 40 mm. Then, I've added some wooden end stops for supporting the light and the poster from either sides as shown which take about 10 mm\nThen, the lights alone take about 40 mm including the adapter.\nand then finally, the front of the whole frame is a bit higher than the poster so about 10 mm more.

These LEDs are pretty cheap and you can get them at any local electrical or hardware store.\nNext, you need to provide an offset so that your led's dont land on the wooden standoffs installed in the frame. I've given an offset of 20 mm.\nAfter that, divide the area into multiple sections so that the strip width(mine was 5 mm) fits in them (I divided them into 10 kinda equal parts). The LED strips usually have a glue back, so they can glued to the mdf board by cutting them (A scissor mark will be shown along the LED strip that you buy indicating the places at which it can be cut. usually, its after 3 LEDs). Cut the strips according to the length and marks and stick them to the mdf either by using their own glue or by using a glue gun. Normal adhesives dont usually work on mdf as it is highly absorbent.\nNow, the connections. LEDs are connected in parallel, meaning, all the positives of the strips are connected and so are the negatives, which are then connected to the positive and negative output of the adaptor respectively. It is shown in the second figure.\nNow connect the adaptor and check if it works.

Your paper might have a weight (specified in some weight per area unit) that you can compare to your printer's specs. If your printer has a special feed tray for thick paper, use that. If your printer jams up, you can always find a local print shop that will print your paper for a small fee.\nAnother thing you want to double check before printing all of your paper is that you are printing on the correct side of the paper. Some colored and patterned paper have different things on each side. If you have certain colors or patterns you want to be visible, the cut and fold lines need to be on the back of the paper. It is a good idea to send a test sheet of paper through with something written on one side so that you know which side of the paper your printer prints on.\nOnce you've worked these details out, shuffle up your paper and send it through the printer.

I also recommend downloading Pepakura and using it to figure out what sheet of paper a piece is on. It also really helps to see the 3d model when deciding what piece to do next. The free version of Pepakura should allow you to view the model and see what sheet a piece is on.\nIf you are on a Mac or Linux machine, look into installing wine (the software, not the drink!) on your machine. I was able to get Pepakura to run on my Macbook with wine.\nCutting\nWhen cutting out your pieces, only cut along solid lines.\nThe cutting blades will dull out throughout the project, and having a sharp blade makes the process much quicker and easier. I recommend having some spare blades to swap out as you progress through the project.\nFolding\nDashed lines are valley folds. Dash-dot lines are mountain folds. (See the above photo if you aren't sure which is which).\nUsing a straight edge to help with getting precise fold lines is a must. I've heard of some people useing the back of their xacto knife to help score the fold lines. I didn't do this, but you can give it a try to see if it helps for you.\nTaping\nTry to assemble the small intricate edges before doing big, easy ones. It sucks when you need to get to a small flap, but your piece is locked in by another taped flap that prevents you from easily maneuvering around.\nWork your way from the front to the back on each body part.

Each new piece of tape should cover half the width of the previous piece (picture 1). Keep the tape taut as you lay it down and use your free hand to smooth it into place. Press down on each piece to remove air bubbles and to ensure that the tape adheres completely.\nPull up the sheet, starting with the initial layer (picture 2). Note: If you start with the top layer, you may accidentally split the sheet in half.\nFlip the sheet over, hold it in place with very small pieces of tape so it doesn\u2019t shift, and finish the reverse side in the same way as the first (picture 3). Work slowly and deliberately: It\u2019s difficult to adjust a long piece of tape once the two adhesive surfaces are stuck together. If a mistake does occur, smooth it out as best as you can, and consider applying another layer of tape to cover the imperfections.\nTrim the uneven edges with a rotary tool (picture 4).

These instructions include a step-by-step, image-guided process for making pom-poms at home. We\u2019ve also included four additional sets of instructions for some possible at-home projects using your new, fun, and colorful pom-poms!\nPom-poms\nMaterials Needed:\n-Yarn\nMost types and textures of yarn will work well for this project. Keep in mind that for a thinner yarn, a significant amount of more yarn will be required in order to make a more full pom-pom. If an ultra-plush or thicker yarn is being used, we recommend using a larger sized pom-pom maker. If you desire stiffer pom-poms, use a more structured yarn; for floppier pom-poms, use a thinner yarn.\n-Standard pom-pom maker\nStandard pom-pom makers are typically under ten dollars and can be found at most craft stores. Keep in mind that the devices come in various sizes. Each pom-pom maker makes only one size of pom-pom that will be relatively the same size as the device itself.\n-Fabric scissors\nThe right scissors are very important in this craft. Sharpened fabric scissors will produce the most clean-cut and fluffy pom-poms.

This helps make sure the interior depth of the bases are made precisely as needed (see photo 1).\nFor the back piece of the frame I used oak, and the thickness used depended on the style of hinges I planned to use for that case (so some photos show a thicker doubled-up piece, and others show a thinner piece).\nThe remaining pieces of the base are made from 9mm plywood, with the sides layered to create a lip that registers the top cover piece in place.\nThe frame pieces are 3\" and 1 3/4\" tall respectively, and cut to length as needed to create the interior opening sized as noted above.\nAll of these pieces were cut using a table saw for long cuts, and table saw with cross-cut sled to cut them to length.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNU/3F33/JT4TVU9C/FNU3F33JT4TVU9C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIR/TE9R/JT4TVTTR/FIRTE9RJT4TVTTR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Base Measurements"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The pieces for the inside layer of the base were glued and nailed together using a brad nailer, as shown.\nA bottom piece was then cut and glued/nailed in place.\nThen the outer frame pieces were added in the same fashion.

From past 3-4 weeks, I am researching on engraving and I found myself so much attraction towards this work that I decided to step into this new kind of work. I saw many companies selling the set of gravers but overall in the end if you are going to use them then you definitely need to sharpen them again because their sharpness not going to last long because if you are a beginner then I think you are definitely going to break a lot of tip during your work and for that you need to sharpen that graver and there is no doubt that you are not getting the exact angle you need to grave the metal surface. so by considering this thing in my mind I decided to make a set of gravers completely out of scratch and decided to share my experience to other so that anyone who is fascinating about doing this new work can easily able to master this technique. This doesn't seem hard to make the graver shape but if you don't have power honing wheel then this will take a lot of elbow grease to make the set. I am also in one of them who don't have power honing wheel. Some of the things are easier for you to understand in the video part so I definitely recommend you to watch that as well and if you himself a master engraver saying this video on this instructable and found anything wrong then let me know in the comment section so that I am able to update that and everybody knows about that mistake.

If you want to make a set of graver then you definitely not going to use the normal carbon Steel. You need a material which is going to hold it edge for a long time. If you compare normal carbon steel to the high-speed Steel and pay some attention to the composition then you find that high-speed Steel has some different composition. It contains a different kind of element like chromium vanadium molybdenum tungsten so these kinds of material provide much resistance towards aberration so that the reasons why high-speed steel is preferred to make the gravers. Other than that you can use tungsten carbide blanks for making a set of the graver. The only downfall of carbide is that it is very brittle than high-speed Steel but on the other side it going to hold the edge for a longer time. Many master engravers told that if you are beginners in engraving then it's better to use high-speed Steel as a graver as compared to carbide because carbide is less forgiving. So father material you have only two options either to go with high speed steel or you can go with carbide.in my case I go with both of the material to take a look that what amount of difference is in both the material and even if you were beginner in the engraving you will notice the difference between both the materials. And I found that difference during my first attempt at engraving. For the engraving surface I am using mild steel and the stool I am using is made up of carbide 90 degrees graver and during my first three-four lines I break the carbide graver 7 times and then I switch the graver to onglette graver which is made up of high-speed steel and also more forgiving towards the smaller corners. few hours I practice with the outlet graver to make myself comfortable with this new kind of work and once again some confidence I switch the graver bit to the carbide and succeeded as some extent even though I am still breaking the tip of the gravers but the number 7 which was in the first attempt decreases to 1 and I think with the passage of sometimes this number decreases and came down to 0.\nMaterial used:-\n1.

Here are some parameters you can follow:-\n1. For softer material angles from 30\u00b0- 40\u00b0 works\n2. For mostly used material angle from 40\u00b0- 50\u00b0 works\n3.

The importance of heel is to prevent the graver dive deep into the material surface", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 2: Parameters Used in Graver Making"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Before making the graver trample our need to know about different kinds of size, shapes of gravers. In my research, I found that many Japanese master engravers made a bunch of their own set of gravers which doesn't even exist in the books. From that research I learned that it's completely depends upon you that how you can solve your problem. This thing completely depends upon your problem solving techniques. If you saw a person named Ford Half Japanese metalwork you may learn how many different kinds of gravers need to make to solve the problem if normal graver didn't work at that stage. So before jumping to the designing section, I would like to tell you about different kinds of commonly used gravers which I am going to made in this Instructables and their uses.\nV-Point Gravers have a diamond-shaped face but with a sharper cutting angle. They're used for removing background material, shading, cutting borders and star shapes, and for raising beads for stone setting. So all the gravers whose angles vary from 70, 90, 96, 105, 110, 120 & 130 degrees come in v point gravers. Each person prefers different gravers, but what I experienced in my first attempt is that gravers having angles less than 90 degrees are more likely to break or chip. You have to be a little careful about these gravers.\nFlat Gravers have a flat cutting edge with either parallel or slightly tapered sides. They're useful for removing or texturing backgrounds, bright-cutting, block lettering, and cutting consistent width lines for borders. The flat gravers with the slightly tapered sides also are used for inlay work.\nRound Gravers have a round cutting edge with either parallel or slightly tapered sides. They're used primarily for raising and rolling beads for stone setting or cutting smooth curves when engraving or chasing.\nOnglette Gravers have a cutting edge that comes to a fine point and curved sides. They're used for stone setting, line engraving, lettering, and inlay work. Perfect for cutting smooth curves and fine lines.\nOval Gravers have an oval-shaped face with a curved cutting edge. They're useful for shading curved surfaces, deep cutting, and for some styles of block lettering. They're also used for raising and rolling beads for stone setting.\nKnife Gravers have straight sides that taper to a very sharp point. They produce deep, narrow cuts making them great for fine-line engraving and for removing excess metal from around stone settings.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F7K/29R7/JTEN35ZX/F7K29R7JTEN35ZX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1M/JQ5B/JTEN35GV/F1MJQ5BJTEN35GV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRI/ARM0/JTEN35JR/FRIARM0JTEN35JR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1I/1T9G/JTEN35X2/F1I1T9GJTEN35X2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBN/7S1I/JTEN3588/FBN7S1IJTEN3588.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEM/LQCG/JTEN35US/FEMLQCGJTEN35US.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Commonly Used Gravers"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "So the crucial step in making a set of graver is how you can make your templates. Because these are the only thing with which you are able to follow the profile and transfer it on to the graver. The process of making the template is very easy and to illustrate you I am going to upload a set of pictures describing how you can make doors template. So there are few things which going to play an important role in increasing or decreasing the size of the template. Because largest the size of the template, more will be easy to follow that profile precisely, and smaller the template difficult to do your job. as far as gravers are concerned there are two different kinds of graver one are those in which you are using a hand-held hammer to cut down the material surface and second are those in which you use some kind of power tool to remove the material. In my case, I am using foredom to do the job and for the tool attachment, I'm using number 15 hammer handpiece. The link for all of those are in the tools section. So there are few things you need to be considered while designing a graver template as follow:-\n1. Length of the graver:-\nGraver plays an important role in designing the template because if you are using hammer and chisel engraving technique then you can kept your graver length quite long as compared to the pneumatic or handheld have a piece which are work with some Power tools because the graver which you are using along with some Power tools need small graver blank for the cutting action because the tool holder itself has some length and if you are keeping your gravers too long then it would be very difficult for you to do your job. On the other hand, if you are using hammer and chisel technique in which you need to strike the hammer on to the graver back, in that case, you can get the graver length long enough because you have to hold that in your hand and strike with the hammer. You cannot use smaller graver with hammer and chisel technique because it is very difficult to hold that graver and follow the path to cut down the material so that's why I am saying that length of the graver place the important role in designing the template. Longer the length of the graver more will be the area you have to hold the graver to its place during the sharpening process in the templates.\n2. Thickness of the sending block:-\nThe thickness of sending block also plays an important role while designing the template because more will be the thickness of your sending plate the more will be the height needed to keep that phase angle and as a result, a larger template is going to be constructed. So it is difficult for me to illustrate you with just simple writing about the template making process so that's why I am going to upload a set of pictures which will clarify you how you can make the graver template and what are the factors you needed to know while designing your templates. If you did not understand in this phase then I would recommend you to watch the video I think that will clarify your doubt on this part of the project.\n3. Face angle of the graver:-\nFace angle of the graver is another important part of designing the graver template. The face angle varies from 30-60 degree. The bigger the angle is the more will be the height of the template and vice versa.\nTo make the template first draw a box equal to the length and thickness of your grinding stone or plate. Then you have to draw a line whose length is equal to G mm (see Image 2) at an angle which lies between 30-60 degree. This usually depends upon the type of material onto which you have to engrave. For most of the material 45-degree angle works. Then draw a perpendicular at the end of the G towards the table surface and measure that distance which is X mm (see Image 2). Repeat the step for heel as well by taking the angle from 15-20 degree with the same length G mm which we used earlier we got length Y mm. Now we have two lengths having distance known for both sides. Now draw a horizontal line on a paper and draw perpendicular onto it. At X mm distance draw a circle where you need to drill the hole for the graver holder. After that extend that line to Ymm more. That is going to make the heel. The tip of the Y mm is the Point where the graver tip is going to be reached. Then make the required shape and angle by considering that point as the extreme end and everything you have to draw needs to remain below that point. This is how your face and heel can be formed. The same process has to be repeated with the clearance template the angle varies from 5-8 degree. If it seems too step then lower the angle. If you don't want to use this template then try to use thinner material like near about 2 mm. That case, you don't need a smaller template.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLO/NUVT/JTEN35M7/FLONUVTJTEN35M7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD4/5B0V/JTEN35NR/FD45B0VJTEN35NR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZH/RNUZ/JTEN35SJ/FZHRNUZJTEN35SJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F65/AAAS/JTEN3BR3/F65AAASJTEN3BR3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Designing the Templates"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "The alignment hole is also one of the necessary parts in designing the template because this is the only thing which helps you to align the graver and lockdown to its place at exact position in each attempt in different graver templates. So the location of the hole can be made anywhere on the template you want but the main point to be noted that the hole was not too far from the graver holder reach. If you Mark the hole location too far then the graver holders will not be going to lock down and you are ended up with the nasty result. Other things also taking care of while marking the alignment hole is that the location needed to be the same position in all of the templates because the dimension and the graver holder is same for all of the templates and if you make this alignment hole wrongly then you are ended up with inconsistent grind and that is not good for engraving. It is always good to design the whole location according to the smallest template because if you design it according to the longer template and made it to for then there might be a chance that the hole appears out of the smaller templates. So these are the few things you need to know about this alignment hole.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFA/H1B8/JTEMZSFQ/FFAH1B8JTEMZSFQ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Making the Alignment Hole in the Template"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Once the design phase of the template has been finished the only thing left is to make them for use. For that, I glue the templates onto a piece of acrylic. For the acrylic, I am using cast acrylic because it works well on to the scroll saw because it did not melt during the cutting process. so I would definitely recommend preferring cast acrylic over the extruded acrylic because cast gives you a better result. So once the templates have been glued onto the acrylic I mark the hole location with a spring loaded center punch and I am very careful during this process because the tiny amount of misalignment can affect my graver final outcome. Then I cut all of the templates onto my scroll saw. Here I tried my best to get as close as possible as I can because this is also the first time I am using this scroll saw and the quality of cut completely blew my mind. I highly recommend this kind of power tool in the workshop. Since it's my first project with the scroll saw the cuts are slightly wiggly because of the lack of experience and to remove that wiggle I use a set of needle files to do that work. I hold them into my vice and then carefully reached to the final lines what I needed. This is definitely not the accurate method but if you pay some attention to this then you will achieve closest to that accuracy. You can use CNC or laser cutter for this project. The 3d printer also is a good option for making these templates. So go whatever you find easy. So once the templates are completely finalize the only thing left is to drill the holes. So as I described earlier there are going to be two holes one for the graver holder and second for the holder alignment. For the holder, I am going to drill 10 mm hole because I am using 10 mm bolt for the holder lock down onto the template and for the alignment hole I go with 3mm hole because I am using 3mm grub screws. So at this stage, the templates are ready to use.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FQQ/Y7TQ/JTEMZSL6/FQQY7TQJTEMZSL6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSD/6KDV/JTEMZSLD/FSD6KDVJTEMZSLD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYW/AG7C/JTEMZSLH/FYWAG7CJTEMZSLH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZG/RCYB/JTEMZSM6/FZGRCYBJTEMZSM6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFU/HU4W/JTEMZSMB/FFUHU4WJTEMZSMB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFN/AGZ6/JTEMZSME/FFNAGZ6JTEMZSME.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKN/9ZDN/JTEN0MXI/FKN9ZDNJTEN0MXI.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0E/YPRF/JTEN0OFA/F0EYPRFJTEN0OFA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCS/JMTS/JTEN0OJU/FCSJMTSJTEN0OJU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDC/AYCO/JTEN0OJV/FDCAYCOJTEN0OJV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGX/FYXG/JTEN0OP3/FGXFYXGJTEN0OP3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4R/249R/JTEN0OYB/F4R249RJTEN0OYB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Making the Template's"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "So this one is also the most time-consuming process in this build and the main reason for this is that I made 6 unsuccessful tries and then able to make this final version. But even then if I compared this with the finishing I am definitely not happy that much but I think if you have a lack of tools then you have to compromise at some place. So come onto the building section of this holder I cut down \u00be\u201d piece of round stock and I roughly cut down it to around 1\u201d in length. Then with the help of center finding jig, I marked the center onto this stock and repeat the same procedure onto the back side also. Then I first use 3mm drill to make the pilot hole and I approach the same thing from both sides drill the hole from the back side since the dimensions of the graver blank is 4mmX4mm and therefore I drill a 4mm hole. Once the 4mm hole has been drilled throughout at one of its ends I drilled 8mm hole and that is used to make the tap for m10 bolt which I am going to fit inside this holder blank. Once the tap has been made inside that hole I made a test piece and insert it into the jig. And everything seems to be work fine. Then I hold that holder into the vice and drill through the hole into that so that graver blank can be put inside that hole. Onto the threaded portion, I drilled a slightly larger hole so that no additional work needs to be done on that side. Since I drill a 4mm hole and the 4mm square graver blank not going to fit inside that hole so I hold that holder into the vice and start filling down the hole to a square section until the graver blank fits inside that hole. Once this thing is achieved I made a mark perpendicular to one of the square faces and the main reason to do this is to make a locking mechanism for the holder to lock down the graver to its place during the grinding process of the graver blank. Once the mark is done I center punch and drill the hole and then make the thread with the m4 tap. Now comes the tricky part that's why I said that it's good to use lathe machine for this process. So to remove the bulkiness of the holder I hold it inside the drill and then grind the taper but making sure not to remove too much of the material because out of 19 mm 10 mm is used by that bolt and in the remaining material we need to provide some space and drill hole for the 3 mm grub screw and that thing also need some space. So this kind of things you need to take care of while grinding the taper. Another thing you need to remember that the portion where you make a tap for 4mm hold down, don't grind that area too much otherwise the number of thread decreases and you are not able to hold your graver in the holder. One thing also to suggest you that if the holder seems bigger for some of the templates then change the angle in the design and remake the template, you can also change the hole position of the holder slightly down where your grinding is not disturbed by that holder. So you can say this is a little bit of try and error. In my case, I grind that holder into a triangular shape so that it will not come in the way of grinding plate. I also remove the bulkiness of the nut as well I hold it into the drill and then grind the surface to make it round in shape.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIW/FONB/JTEN0P8Z/FIWFONBJTEN0P8Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEP/38X3/JTEN0PA1/FEP38X3JTEN0PA1.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0A/9MRT/JTEN0X97/F0A9MRTJTEN0X97.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8F/TP42/JTEN0X9C/F8FTP42JTEN0X9C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLW/DF7E/JTEN0X9E/FLWDF7EJTEN0X9E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F52/ZC5R/JTEN0X9G/F52ZC5RJTEN0X9G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F26/PI7N/JTEN0X9I/F26PI7NJTEN0X9I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F82/MBK9/JTEN0X9M/F82MBK9JTEN0X9M.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCX/3P3M/JTEN0X9Q/FCX3P3MJTEN0X9Q.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FV3/F5XR/JTEN0X9R/FV3F5XRJTEN0X9R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHO/IV1F/JTEN0X9S/FHOIV1FJTEN0X9S.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXE/BQL4/JTEN0XA0/FXEBQL4JTEN0XA0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR7/WW5G/JTEN0XA2/FR7WW5GJTEN0XA2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIE/FOWP/JTEN0XA7/FIEFOWPJTEN0XA7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKD/FOT5/JTEN0XAB/FKDFOT5JTEN0XAB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIW/8NMS/JTEN0XAG/FIW8NMSJTEN0XAG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3X/H3RG/JTEN0XAL/F3XH3RGJTEN0XAL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Making the Graver Holder"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "this is the easiest part of this build and what you need to do is hold the graver holder into the jig and insert the graver blank inside the holder and lock down the graver to its place inside that holder.

For cutting, I use two different methods. In first I use foredom and a diamond wheel to cut down the graver blank but the one wheel completely wear off to cut down one blank. So I approached a different technique. I grind the line around the perimeter or the graver with the help of diamond file and then hold it as closer to that line in the vice. Then apply a little amount of force to break it in half. It is very easy to snap this in half but to get a good cut you need to scour the line around all four sides.

Unfortunately, I didn't make any- so here are some after-the-fact! (Refer to the pdf- I don't recommend it as a template, but it will give you a sense or placement and proportion.)\nI started by cutting a knife shape and the handle form on the band saw. The initial knife shape was pretty straightforward- \"blade\" with a long tail that will work well as a handle and lever, and \"handle\" with holes to serve as a pivot point, and a slot for the tail piece.\nThe center rectangle should be about the width of the thickness of your knife metal, plus a little extra for washers. The placement of the holes was tricky- I found a good spot by cutting out my knife piece and kind of imagining how it would pivot. You want the blade to be completely covered by the brass when \"sheathed\" (rotated in) and you want as much blade as possible when rotated out.\nConsider printing and cutting out the pdf drawings, putting a pin through the holes, and seeing how it all fits together- you can make your own custom template this way, too.\nWe all make mistakes.\nZoom in on the brass. See how both sides of the handle have double dimples? I couldn't decide where to put the hole, so I marked the spot twice. At least I didn't drill it.

I did this by using a ball peen hammer to make dimples in the surface of the brass that would face out. Once the brass gets too hard, don't try to force it- heat it until it turns a dull red, then throw it in water (quench it). This is called annealing, and it's a process by which metal is relaxed to become more workable.\nEither before or after texturing, drill holes for the hinge in the handle. The important thing is that they are symmetrical to each other across the center line of the handle. To drill a perfectly sized hole, measure the piece of rod you're using with calipers or a micrometer, and use a drill bit with the same diameter. If you don't have a ton of drill bits, that's fine! Go for the next closest size up.\nOnce your handle is satisfactory, fold it! There are a number of ways to do this- I clamped mine and bent it around a ninety degree corner, then again around a piece of metal with a thickness that I liked. Take it slow- if it gets wonky (it did for me) and the holes become misaligned, anneal it, and work it a little more. Hole alignment and having the slot in the middle of the handle are the most important bits.\nEDIT\nWhen you have the drill press set up to drill your handle, go ahead and drill your pivot point in your blade blank too.

Once you have your blade cut out, and a hole drilled where you want it, approach the grinder (with confidence- you are gonna own this grind). Practice on some metal first, to get a sense of angle and control.\nI like to hold a work piece in some Vice Grips- you don't have to, but if you don't, dunk it frequently so it stays cool and holdable. I encourage you to research bevel types, but if you're lazy like me, here's a crash course.\nThe bevel is the \"blade\" part of a blade, where it goes from the thickest part (the spine) the the thinnest (the edge). There's loads of types of bevels, which we won't get into. A great, functional, and simple bevel is the flat bevel- a flat transition from the spine to the edge.\nTo grind, hold your work piece at an angle against the grinder. The angle your hold your work piece at will be mirrored by the grind- I like to grind nice and long, almost as if I'm just pressing the flat of the blade against the grind, but at the slightest angle. Make sure the edge doesn't look wonky- you want it to taper to the tip but still be sharp along the whole length.\n\nGrinding is an art, to be learned by doing. If you want this knife to be perfect, practice on scrap metal a lot. This is my fifth or sixth knife, so I'm just starting to feel good about my grinds. Find photos of knives you like and try to emulate those.\nI start with a 60 or 80 grit sandpaper, and move up to 120, then, 320 or 400 off the grinder.

Make sure you can heat the knife without setting anything on fire.\nFirst we harden. Apply heat to the blade until it all turns an even, cherry red- I like to start at the spine, so by the time it's hot enough the thinner blade will be ready, too. As soon as you evenly achieve this color, quickly dunk the whole knife in oil. Stir it around, watching out for flames. After a couple stirs, take it out and make sure it's straight. Small bends can be gently corrected. Use the table vice to grip the blade, and very slowly reverse any kinks- check your work frequently, since you only have about ten seconds. If there are still bends after that window closes, thats okay! Reheat the blade to cherry red and then let it air cool.

As you slide the mask, it cycles through the four frames, giving the illusion of motion.\nThe downside of this technique is that the mask is mostly dark, so the more frames in the animation, the darker it will make the animation look.

For those who are interested, the \".scad\" files are attached.\nI then used the GIMP to create a custom 20x20 pattern that consisted of one line of white pixels and three lines of black pixels repeated five times. This pattern was used for the mask. I installed this into my GIMP patterns directory as a custom pattern (see tutorial here or see the pre-made \"four-frames.pat\" file that I attached).\nI then opened the four animation frames I exported from OpenSCAD into GIMP using the \"Open as Layers...\" feature. I changed the mode of the images to \"Indexed Color\" and selected the 1-bit B&W palette. I changed the resolution of the image to 150 dpi, so that it would print okay on a 300 dpi laser printer.\nFor each layer, I right clicked and selected \"Add Layer Mask...\" and then checked \"Show Layer Mask\" for each layer. I used the Bucket Fill tool to fill each layer mask with the custom mask pattern. The mask makes it so just one line out of every four will be shown, with the others masked out.\nIt is then necessary to stagger the masks so that each layer contributes a different line. I zoomed the document to 800%, scrolled to the top of the image, and used the Move Tool to move the white row of pixels in the 1st mask to the 1st line of the image, to the 2nd line of pixels for the 2nd mask, to the 3rd line of pixels for the 3rd mask, and to the 4th line of pixels on the 4th mask. I then unchecked \"Show Layer Mask\" and \"Edit Layer Mask\" for each layer, giving me the composite image.\nThe resulting file was saved as \"greeting_card_template.xcf\".\nIf you want to make a new pattern, you can do so by opening that file. Right click each layer and select \"Disable Layer Mask\" for each layer. Also make sure \"Show Layer Mask\" and \"Edit Layer Mask\" are unchecked. You should now be able to switch from layer to layer and replace the gears with four new frames of your choosing.

For the sake of this Instructable, we would like to achieve something similar to the ball dropping - nothing too complex but still very visually appealing.\nIf you are struggling to come up with an idea for your flipbook, I highly recommend starting with the ball animation (Picture 2).You can even use the photo I have here as a reference! It really drives home the principle of animation and it still looks fantastic once it is completed. Also, you don't have to worry about replicating different images over and over again, but rather just one image a couple of times.

If you want to make a grade school ball bouncing type book then there really isn't too much thought or complication to it. However, if you want movement, frame changing, or a story to be told through it, then its going to take some thought and planning.\nInspiration for these types of books can come from the simplest of places. For example, my internet this last week has had problems working and when that would happen, I would keep seeing this dinosaur pop up that we all know and sometimes love (he isn't always appearing under the most enjoyable circumstances). And when this little game would pop up, it would provide some momentary joy as your internet would try and find its way back from the twilight zone.\nI thought that it would be a fun idea to create mini-story out of it.\nWhatever you choose, make it your own! Your ideas could be based off of something or it could be something totally unique to you!

We don't want all of your hard work to be for nothing. Instead, make sure you are drawing on the right side of book. Also, be sure to leave a little space on the right so your thumb doesn't obscure any of the drawings as well. (This may not be an issue if you don't have massive thumbs like me ^^) (Picture 1)\nSecond - As you are drawing each individual page, make sure that you are numbering each page as you go in the corner. It really is so annoying if you accidentally mess up the order of the pages and spend hours of your time sorting through the minor differences to try and reconstruct the story. All of the time can be saved if you just simply number the backside corners of the pages as you go. This will not be visible as you are flipping through your book and if your pages ever get mixed up, it will be a simple fix. I had this happen to me several times as I was making my book so I highly recommend doing this. (Picture 2)\nThird - Create some drawings for any reoccurring patterns that you may encounter making your flipbook. In my case, the entire thing is a reoccurring pattern so I made sure to make a couple of initial highly detailed stencils of the ground, the dinosaur walking, the birds flapping, and the cacti so that I could use them without wasting time trying to meticulously draw each frame as neatly as I did the previous one. This will save you time and effort and will help you make your flipbook as fast and as neatly as possible. (Picture 3)\nFourth - Use a pencil and eraser when initially doing your drawings. I find that it is so much easier to correct a mistake rather than draw in pen and have to start over the whole frame again if you make a mistake. *Note* You may not have to do this if your flip book is simple enough.\nFifth - Have a mini storyboard to organize your thoughts. When you don't have a meaningful ending to the story, or a goal in sight, you tend to keep drawing and drawing without a specific ending in mind. If you do this, you will 9 times out of 10 quit early due to the magnitude of drawing left to complete the story or the amount of touch-ups you will have to do in the end. A good sized story without too much headache is around 50-150 frames. Any more than that and you are in for a long ride. Keep in mind though that my 130 page flip book was only 25 seconds so be sure to create a story then create a manageable structure for that story.\nNow that we have those general tips under our belts, let's get to the actual process of Illustrating the book.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FR4/GORM/JT91ICKB/FR4GORMJT91ICKB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FP3/DFRT/JT91ICM3/FP3DFRTJT91ICM3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEQ/78K3/JT91IJKT/FEQ78K3JT91IJKT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Helpful Tips to Get Started"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Like I said before, there are some tips to get you working on the Illustrating of the book. These will save you a lot of time and effort. Depending on how long you want your story to be, you may have a lot of illustrating ahead of you. But no need to fear. Once you have your reference cards made, and your idea in place, you will start to develop a rhythm to your flipbook making. In other words, practice makes perfect.\nThe rhythm/pattern I follow for my flip book making is:\nWrite the next slide number in the top right back-side corner (So you don't mess up the order)\nTrace my next slide on top of the previous slide but shifted slightly (Picture 3)\nSet aside face down on the work surface and use the illustrated frame you just made as the template for the next frame.\nRepeat steps 1-3 from before until you are done. (Picture 4)\nOnce you have done this a couple of times, 2-3 frames side-by-side should look somewhat identical with slight variations.

This is my favorite part because you can really just relax, throw on some netflix and color. The book also starts to look really crisp and professional.\nI try to stick to black and white only when it comes to flip books because it can take a long time to color in. For example, my book took a tremendous amount of time to fill in all of the dinosaurs, the cacti and the birds. It would have taken far less time if it was just black and white with nothing filled in. It isn't a bad thing, it just depends on how much detail and time you want to put into your book.

You can achieve this by binding the pages together as tightly as you can. The length or duration of your book should determine what method you choose.\nThere are two main methods with four total methods that I am aware of. I will go over all of them starting with the two main ones. *Note*you can also use pre-punched paper and binding screws but those materials can be either slightly expensive or tough to find. We are doing this project on a \"pennies\" budget so we won't be using those materials.\nThe easiest method and themost time-efficient method is probably method 1.\n-This is simply just a result of binding the note cards together with two binding clips. This will create a tight connection and will make sure that the pages won't move out of place.\nThe second method was the method that I used for my own personal book. My book was about 130 total pages which is quite a lot of paper (Picture 6). If you have binding clips that large, I would still recommend using that method. However, since I didn't have those materials available to me, I used the gluing method.\n-To do this, you cut off a section of Index card (Picture 2) ensuring that it will overlap the bottom and top of the index cards you wish to bind (Picture 3). Next, you pre-fold the binding piece over the cards (Picture 4) and then you glue them (Picture 5). During this process, be sure to glue the back side of the papers. You can do this by running the glue stick along the edge of the papers. When you do this, each of the papers find their own little connections and just adds to the durability of book itself.\nThe third method is to take enough rubber bands pull them over onto the edges. However, I do not like this method because it doesn't apply well across all types of flip books. For example, if you book is a little bit shorter, your flip book will easily be bent by the stress of the rubber bands so I tend to stray from this method when I can.\nThe fourth method is to take duct tape and very tightly and carefully tape the edge of the book. Now this may sound easy, but depending on the size of your book, this could be difficult if you are worried about your pages shifting around as you are taping. So again, I tend to stray from this method.\nNow that you have found the binding method that is right for you, you should be 100% done with your book!

This has always been a big pain because both of these are touch screens - thus resulting in a really scribbled and unprofessional trace. Not to mention I have always been terrified of scratching the screens themselves. I finally decided enough was enough and I made my own light pad - but with a twist.\nThis light box was going to be the king of light boxes.

It is a very expensive option, but if you check out JON-A-TRON's class for 3D printing here, he includes some good recommendations for places where you can get your stuff made, or a pretty inexpensive 3D printer you can purchase.\nI have included three STL files for this project. So in total, you have the top drawer, bottom drawer, and the box. I designed the box so the drawers would just slide in and out without guides but weren't loose enough to fall out if tipped on the side.\nOnce you've printed out the box, you can either prime it and paint it, or you can just take it as is. For me, I didn't want to paint it because of the additional steps involved it also has no effect as far as the functionality of the product itself. However, if that is something you are interested in, by all means paint away! :D Included in the design are also some notches that protrude out slightly on the top to be able to sustain the 5\" x 7\" pane of glass.\nGo ahead and slide the glass pane on to the top of those notches.

The little cubbies in the box are designed for these lights so they fit pretty snug anyways.

Pins need to be sharp too.\nThe finished bag has a base that measures about 27cm x 10cm (10\u00be\" x 4\") and it's 35cm (13\u00be\") tall, plenty big enough to carry a few unexpected purchases home.

This will be my second ever post on Instructable that I will be making and it is a much more updated and detailed version of my previous tutorial. So to start off I need to introduce myself. My name is Thomas Truong and I am a 19 yr old papermodel Artist from Melbourne Australia. I am also know as Hacaosuka Designs as some may have seen on Instagram. Although I spend my time in uni nowadays, I spend the rest of the hours building papermodels of peoples car which they commission. These end up being about 60cm long finished and they tend to become wall arts in someones home. My aim for these models is to make highly detailed 100% paper made model and making them one-offs where the files of each car is never released even at whatever price I receive.\nToday I will be going through the steps of how you could possible do the same for any car you want starting from the 3D modelling process to unfolding the model in Pepakura.

Once decided, do the investigating of what images and angles you may need to get it as accurate as possible. Although the images are more of the modified car, its also good to just search up what a stock body one would look like also and this can help a lot even when there's cosmetics that may have hid the car of what it looks like originally. This can also be the part where you start looking for images you could use as texture later on e.g Headlights.\nAnother thing to look for is the blueprints of the car. This image includes the front, side, top, rear views of the car at a orthogonal perspective and also the width, height and length.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTC/0YLD/JT4TXZSS/FTC0YLDJT4TXZSS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUG/ZINN/JT4TY00F/FUGZINNJT4TY00F.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Decision and Image Searching"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "So for this stage, it doesn't really matter on what programs you have used before. Doesn't matter if you use Sketchup Pro, Blender or 3ds max, the same process applies to all. Although for people that haven't used any of these programs before I would recommend Google Sketchup due to its snap lock abilities making it easier for this kind of work. Although you have to pay for the program, there's the 30 day trial you could try out and I have added an extra thing for you at the end of this stage. :p\nhttps://www.sketchup.com/try-sketchup\nTo start of first, You need to set up the blueprints which you need to crop first so that each part is touching the edge of the border. For e.g wheels touching bottom border, roof touching the top e.t.c e.t.c Import the images as an Image.\n(Make sure the Camera is set to Parallel Projection by the way!)\nAnother thing to take note are those 3 lines. The green is the Y axis which moves back and forwards , The red is the X Axis which moves Left and Right and the Z axis moves up and down. Now that you know this, this is how you control your line. This can be done through your arrow keypads and will lock in the direction the line goes.\nNow align them as shown above. Now from here my preferable way is to start from the bonnet tracing the lines from the top view. Then once done move the bonnet up to the height of what the side view looks like. Check the front and make sure its aligned up and then continue the same step by starting the line from the bonnet and working your way around the whole car. You only have to make half the car as it can be duplicated and aligned up symmetrically through this step. Tap the 3 times to select the whole model, Right click and select make component, press create, and then CTRL drag the model. Finally flip the model by right clicking and selecting flip along components red and join the model. Now if you edit the right it will automatically edit the other side also.\nI have added a file below for those who want to see the linework (image 4) and want to connect the polygons themself.

Then drag the inner circle to the other side of the tire and tap the back side face and it should automatically remove the face leaving a wall.

Have something to help with rounding curves to give it its clean smooth bodywork. By having the same coloured texta you can hide the white edges of the templates making it look more realistic. Do full closed parts last for e.g the back wall of the tire which connects to the wheel arches. Superglue will be helpful in some circumstances also. Start with the front of your car and build all the way to the back. Then the underbody and finally other seperate parts such as the spoiler, wheels, side mirror e.t.c e.t.c\nNow that you know what to do, Go ahead! Try it out and once the model is done, apply a few layers of clear coat to give it that shiny finish! Go display on your bedroom wall or the living room next to your TV. The options are endless!

Any comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated.\n\nHigh Density PolyEthylene (HDPE) is one of the most commonly used plastics today, being used in a wide variety of items from tiny pill bottles to large barrels and water storage tanks. Chances are that in the last 24 to 48 hours you have carried groceries home in plastic shopping bags made of HDPE, drunk juice or milk from an HDPE jug, or pop from a bottle with an HDPE cap, thrown dirty clothes into a plastic clothes hamper made of HDPE, washed your hair with shampoo from an HDPE bottle, and thrown several HDPE jugs and bottles into a recycling box, also made of HDPE.\nI first got interested in recycling HDPE about a year and a half ago, after stumbling across a few videos on the subject. The idea of remelting HDPE intrigued me, doubly so, because the resulting blocks and sheets can be cut and worked with ordinary woodworking tools as easily as wood. (i.e. My bandsaw chews through HDPE as easily as the softest pine.)\nI have spent most of the last year doing only occasional melting experiments, without any clear projects to make from the resulting blocks. However, with Christmas coming up in a couple of months, three nieces to get presents for, and not a lot of money in my pocket to buy said presents, I have finally thought of a use for my HDPE. This year, I am going to make bangle bracelets for my nieces to wear.\nMaterials needed:\nHigh Density PolyEthylene from various bottles and plastic bags\nTools needed:\nDish washing detergeant for cleaning HDPE containers\nA solvent such as Goo Gone or Goof Off to remove label adhesive from containers. WD40 also appears to work for this purpose.\nAn expendable pair of scissors or heavy duty shears to cut jugs, bottles, and other HDPE items into smaller pieces\nContainers for storing the HDPE pieces\nA 4 inch (10cm) diameter soup can to use as a mold\nA can opener for opening the can\nAn oven with temperature controls\nA saw for cutting a wooden disk\n5 inch C-clamps for compressing the HDPE. A jack, such as a scissor jack or a bottle jack may work as well.\nA wooden disk for compressing the HDPE\nScrap wood\nAviation snips for cutting the 4 inch can\nA pair of pliers for tearing open the can\nA hammer and 2 chisels to separate the wooden disk from the HDPE blank\nA centre finder (home made) to find the centre of the HDPE blank\nA drill press (optional) or hand drill.\nA heat gun for remelting small areas of the HDPE. A wind proof lighter *might* also work for this purpose (I have not tested this).\nA lathe\nLathe tools (parting tool, gouge, and skew chissel)\nA caliper or ruler\nSeveral grades of sandpaper\nA spindle sander or drum sander (optional)\nThe patience of Job (required)", "title": "Making Bracelets From Recycled HDPE Plastic", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Making-Bracelets-From-Recycled-HDPE-Plastic/", "section": "craft", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "HDPE is one of the most common plastics today.

These tend to be much easier to remove than paper labels. They are also attached to the bottles with adhesive, which will also need to be removed the same way as the paper labels.\nMany laundry detergent bottles have a strange sort of plastic label.

It totally depends upon you to choose the length of the strip as this will determine the overall size of the flower.\nThen, using the quilling tool, roll the strip into a tight circle and glue the end.

It is a weaving technique used to create anything from jewelry to animals and boxes using beads, adding them one by one. This technique is very time-demanding and mastering it requires practice, time and patience. The real and fair price of the beadwoven jewelry easily equals that of jewelry made from precious metals. Even experienced jewelry makers need lots of time to make a piece and the quality material is not a cheap thing. Beadweaving uses several stitches, one of them being the peyote stitch that I will teach you in this tutorial. And I'll not just teach you the stitch, I'll also show you how to use it and make a flower, a ring and weave around a rivoli. You can choose any colors you like but in case you want to use the same like mine, there's a detailed description of the material used in the next step.", "title": "Beadweaving - the Flower Ring", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Beadweaving-the-Flower-Ring/", "section": "craft", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Material\n- beads - 2 sizes\n- beading needle\n- beading thread\n- rivoli\n- scissors\nQuality material is really important here. If you want to just try beadweaving and you are willing to accept that you might not like the result you can work with what you find at home - nameless beads and normal using thread. However, if you want to work smoothly and the result to be worth anything, you will have to invest into the material and tools. Check out the online stores with beading supplies and maybe there's even a shop in your town (in Czech Republic it is really easy to get quality beads and supplies especially in bigger cities).\nNeedles\nThe beading needles are different from usual sewing needles. They are very thin and don't get thicker around the eye, which makes it possible for them to pass through the beads. You can get them in many sizes marked with numbers. The higher the number, the thinner the needle. I use John James needles and as a general rule I'd say that for beads size 15 (Japanese) you need a needle size 15 and for beads size 11 you need a needle size 12.\nBeads\nIf you want to make quality jewelry, you just cannot use some cheap nameless beads. They tend to be very irregular, stain etc. Basically, you have two options - Czech or Japanese beads. The Czech beads are made in the city of Jablonec, home of the Preciosa beads and the famous Czech glass industry. We can be proud of it, it is of a very high quality and well knows all around the world. It comes is hundreds of shapes, colors and finishes. The Japanese beads are more expensive and it's suitable especially for projects that require a high level of regularity - the Japanese beads tend to be really very very regular in shape. Some of the good Japanese marks are TOHO, Miyuki or Matubo. You will need beads of two sizes for this project, bigger amount of the larger beads and just very few of the smaller ones - I am using the following (Japanese):\n- red - TOHO TR-11-45 (flower and ring)\n- black - TOHO TR-11-49F (flower and rivoli)\n- white - TOHO TR-11-41 (flower and rivoli rivoli)\n- green - TOHO TR-15-44 (rivoli)\nRivoli\nRivoli is the crystal I'm using in the center of the flower. It's a crystal stone shaped pointy towards the center. The most famous rivoli are made by Swarovski, nowadays there are also cheaper copies on the market.\nThread\nSame like the needles, the beadweaving thread is quite different from a sewing thread. It is flat and with a smooth finish to pass easily through the very thin eye of the beading needle. Probably the most famous thread is the nylon thread called NYMO which comes in many colors and sizes from 00 (thinnest) to F (thickest). You have to choose the thickness of your thread according to the bead size and you have to choose your needle according to the thickness of the thread. Another famous and really good thread is the Fireline. For this project I'm using red NYMO in size B for the flower and ring and black NYMO in size B for the rivoli.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVS/K11F/JSYZ8OGO/FVSK11FJSYZ8OGO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRP/C1BK/JSYZ8OIS/FRPC1BKJSYZ8OIS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX2/H137/JSYZ8OKU/FX2H137JSYZ8OKU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4D/GEN0/JSYZ8OMK/F4DGEN0JSYZ8OMK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Material"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Remember, glue and knots have no place in a beadwoven jewelry when it comes to finishing one thread and starting another.

If you really need to make a knot you should find a way to hide it and make sure no one will ever see it - but that would need to be some very exceptional case. Using glue is never justifiable. Later on I will show you how to finish a piece of thread and start a new one.\nBefore you start I recommend you to prepare some bowls for the beads or a fleece pad on which you can distribute the beads according to their size and color.

A Tripod - Your tripod should be able to move up and down, and have a head that tilts back and forth. Depending on how wide of a shot you want, you may also need some tripod accessories (see optional)\n3. A Light Source(s) - This could be a window letting in natural light, an LED light panel, A diffusion box, a shop light, etc.\n4.

Use the Manual Settings on Your Camera - This allows you to control and repeat how much light is getting into the camera by adjusting the aperture (how big a hole light can get through), shutter speed (how long that hole is open), and ISO (how sensitive your sensor is to light).\n2. Use a Tripod - This is a necessary step because then you can control the angle of your photograph by tilting and turning the camera on the tripod. This angle can be locked in place to keep the camera steady.\n3. Use Stationary Lights & Bounce Cards - Put lights on some kind of stand or table so that they stay in one place. You can use flashes or continuous light, one light or multiple. For still life subjects, such as food photography, it is recommended that you have your key (main light) coming from the side or from behind. To fill in any shadows some kind of bounce card can be used to \"bounce\" light back at an overly dark area.\n4. Use a Tether - Plug your camera into a computer running tethering software with a tethering cord. This allows you to control your camera from your computer and import photos directly into the computer. This will speed up your process because you can see final images on a large screen and make decisions on what else needs to be adjusted in your final image.\nBy controlling as many elements as possible a studio setup allows a photographer to first get technical elements right and then focus solely on your subject, adjusting composition and giving direction.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F74/5ZH3/JSUP0LAS/F745ZH3JSUP0LAS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBW/H83Q/JSUP0LAT/FBWH83QJSUP0LAT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPW/9GIV/JSUP0LAV/FPW9GIVJSUP0LAV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Studio Setup"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Angles:\n90\u00b0.....Camera facing down, called a \"Flat Lay\", \"Birds Eye\" or \"Down Shot\"\n45\u00b0.....Camera diagonal to your subject\n10\u00b0.....Camera slightly above your subject\n0\u00b0.......Camera facing front, looking strait at your subject\n-90\u00b0....Camera facing up, called a \"Worms Eye\" or \"Up Shot\"\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDistances:\nExtreme Close-up.....Super close to the subject, good for showing fine detail and texture, \"Macro\"\nClose-up....................In tight on your subject with very little surrounding it\nMedium Shot.............Slightly backed off of your subject, enough to see the context of what is around the subject\nWide Shot....................Shows the full area around your subject, showcasing a wider scene", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOA/PMOV/JSL36M5U/FOAPMOVJSL36M5U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB5/8NR5/JSL36M2H/FB58NR5JSL36M2H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1I/I8YV/JSL36LZ5/F1II8YVJSL36LZ5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLF/5FR2/JSUP0LJU/FLF5FR2JSUP0LJU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZR/JP5H/JSL36M45/FZRJP5HJSL36M45.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F7U/ZJ69/JSL367RX/F7UZJ69JSL367RX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Perspective Overview"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "So with so many options how do we choose where to put the camera?\n-----------------------------------------------\nIt all depends on your subject!

I also was worried that if I made a weighted t-shirt blanket then decided I just wanted it to be a regular blanket that it would take a lot of work to remove all of the weight inside the blanket.\nSo...that led me to the idea of making a weighted duvet, and a t-shirt duvet cover. That way the weights would be in a separate blanket and not wear on the t-shirts, and if I decided I'd rather just have this duvet cover become a regular t-shirt blanket it's a really easy fix.\nNow that the duvet cover is done, next up is for me to make the weighted duvet. I will be making the weighted duvet using a king size sheet folded in half, sewn into columns, then row by row filled with poly pellet weights.

Once you get confident, you can use your rotary cutter to make all the cuts; this makes it go a lot faster with smoother lines! Finish cutting all your shirts before proceeding.\nTake a shirt and roughly cut a piece of interfacing that is larger than the print/logo. Place the interfacing bumpy side down on the backside of the logo or desired section of shirt, lay an extra scrap t-shirt on top of it, and iron on the interfacing according to package instructions.

After that, you will add \u00bc\u201d seam allowances on all sides. Stay with me. Here are examples of what I mean:\nYou have a logo or print that is 3.25\u201d by 10\u201d. You will round up the 3.25\u201d side to 4\u201d and your 10\u201d side to 12\u201d. Then you will add in your \u00bc\u201d on all sides. That makes the final block 4.5\u201dx12.5\u201d.\nYou have a logo or print that is 4.5\u201dx13.5\u201d. You will round up the 4.5\u201d side to 8\u201d and 13.5\u201d side to 16\u201d. After adding in the \u00bc\u201d, the finished block will be 8.5\u201dx16.5\u201d.\nTo make it easier, you are welcome to assume all block sides will be 4.5\u201d,8.5\u201d,12.5\u201d, or 16.5\u201d, but then you might cut off a logo. For example, you might have a logo that is 12.25\u201dx12.25\u201d; you think, that fits into a 12.5\u201dx12.5\u201d square, so I\u2019m good. But when you go to sew your \u00bc\u201d seam, you will lose sides of your logo. This is up to you. Sometimes I don\u2019t mind if a snippet of a logo is cut off because I don\u2019t want to go up to 16.5\u201d, but sometimes the print needs to be wholly intact, so I round up to a bigger size.\n---\nSo what\u2019s the best way to start? Find the exact center of the print/logo. I start by measuring the height of the print. The Mizzou logo is 2\u201d tall. Half of that? 1\u201d. I mark the half point on the left and right side of the logo and draw a line connecting the two, creating the horizontal center line. Then I measure the width of the logo. This one is 10.5\u201d wide, with the half mark at 5.25\u201d. I mark the top and bottom of the logo and draw a vertical line. Now we have the \u201cexact\u201d center.\nI know that my 10.5\u201d width logo needs to be rounded up to 12\u201d with a \u00bc\u201d extra on each side of the center line (that means 6.25\u201d to the right and left, equalling 12.5\" total). Hey, I said this wasn\u2019t beginner, right? :) Take your ruler (or rulers if you don\u2019t have a wide enough one) and measure 6.25\u201d off the right of the center line. DOUBLE CHECK. Then cut. Do the same thing on the left side. I double check to make sure I cut it right. 12.5\u201d width? Yep. Moving on.\nNow I will cut the top and bottom. My 2\u201d tall logo has to be rounded up to 4\u201d (totaling 4.5\u201d). I place my ruler at the 2.25\u201d mark and cut the top of the block. My identical next cut on the bottom will make the completed height 4.5\u201d.\nThe staring logo was 2\u201dx 10.5\u201d and the final block is 4.5\u201dx12.5\u201d.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFH/8UJJ/JSUOWJXJ/FFH8UJJJSUOWJXJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3Q/O2Z8/JSUOW26N/F3QO2Z8JSUOW26N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1E/KBI3/JSUOW26E/F1EKBI3JSUOW26E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4M/ZI5Q/JSUOW2YV/F4MZI5QJSUOW2YV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFE/URU3/JSUOW2CW/FFEURU3JSUOW2CW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAZ/34N6/JSUOW25A/FAZ34N6JSUOW25A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRB/224I/JSUOW1GZ/FRB224IJSUOW1GZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN3/OHO7/JSUOW1A0/FN3OHO7JSUOW1A0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGA/K4CC/JSUOW1P4/FGAK4CCJSUOW1P4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJJ/9Z82/JSUOW1YX/FJJ9Z82JSUOW1YX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSV/P1PB/JSUOW236/FSVP1PBJSUOW236.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWD/2AB1/JSUOW23V/FWD2AB1JSUOW23V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY5/H3EB/JSUOW23W/FY5H3EBJSUOW23W.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: T-Shirt Trimming to Blocks"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "After all that previous work, the best feeling is when you have a logo size that matches a ruler you own!

I had over 70 pieces, so I couldn\u2019t get a spot big enough.\nDo you have a favorite shirt that would be perfect for the center of the quilt? Pick it and let\u2019s start. I chose my first ever sorority shirt because of the symbolism and because it\u2019s so colorful, and I placed it roughly in the center of the floor. Then I picked a shirt that wasn\u2019t so bright (plain and white) and laid it touching but higher than the first shirt; they are touching on the top and bottom 3\u201d of both shirts.\nThe most important thing to remember when laying out shirts is each block side can be divided into 4\u201d sections. (A 4\u201d side is one section, an 8\u201d side has 2 sections, a 12\u201d side has 3 sections, and a 16\u201d side has 4 sections.) To make the shirt layout work, you can\u2019t just lay shirts out willy-nilly. Sides either need to line up perfect (i.e. an 8\u201d side lines up to an 8\u201d side) or the shirts overlap according to \"sections\". My first and second shirt overlap one section (they overlap 4\"). This means an 8\u201d tall block would fit perfectly on top of the first block and line up with the top of the second block.\nYou will get slight overhangs when laying out the quilt because of the \u00bc\u201d seam allowance, but when sewed, the quilt fits perfectly together; you will understand once you start laying out the quilt. It will work, I promise!\nNow, unless magic happened, there will be holes. In one of the last pictures, I have the quilt size I want, but there are gaps where I didn't have enough shirts. This is an easy fix. I know by looking at the quilt holes what size block I will need to fill these gaps. You will too. You will see a hole bigger than 4.5\u201d but smaller than 12.5\u201d and think, I need an 8.5\u201d piece. Often, I will just need a 4.5\u201dx4.5\u201d scrap piece to fill a small gap. Other times, if I am widening a quilt, I will use bigger pieces. It just depends on the look you\u2019re going for. After you know what size you need, pick a scrap piece of shirt, add interfacing, and treat it just like a regular t-shirt block.\nScrap blocks are a perfect way to add more color to an area or just break up a print heavy section, so don't throw those scraps away until the very end!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFZ/BLU6/JSUOX4OG/FFZBLU6JSUOX4OG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ3/0TF0/JSUOX4PN/FQ30TF0JSUOX4PN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAD/983H/JSUOX4RN/FAD983HJSUOX4RN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZK/R2N0/JSUOX4YE/FZKR2N0JSUOX4YE.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCJ/YTG9/JSUOX522/FCJYTG9JSUOX522.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8F/7OEQ/JSUOX56Z/F8F7OEQJSUOX56Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPS/8DHM/JSUOX5IU/FPS8DHMJSUOX5IU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY1/1JB8/JSUOX5LD/FY11JB8JSUOX5LD.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Quilt Layout"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Before you move on and sew anything, take a bunch of pictures!

I started at the top left.\nYellow: sew the easy stuff. The small blocks are literally building blocks. You can\u2019t move on until these are sewed. Basically, sew everything that has a 1:1 matching edge (like an 8\" block and 8\" block). Think: would I have to do anything weird to sew these together? I have squared in yellow the blocks I sewed first.\nBlue: next I sew together more 1:1 sides that I couldn't do in the previous step. For example, I can't sew a 4.5\" to a 12.5\" square, so I'll sew the 4.5\" to an 8.5\", which equals 12.5\", and THEN sew those two blocks to the 12.5\" square. Basically, just keep adding on. The light blue represents the first sections sewed together and the dark blue is just me adding on more blocks that line up perfectly.\nMagenta: this is where it starts to get weird. You'll reach a point where blocks don't line up perfectly anymore and you'll eventually need to sew a block into the \"L\" of another set of blocks. Yes, this is confusing. Don't worry; you'll know exactly what I mean when you get to this point! When you have a seam that just ends (like sewing a 4.5\" side to an 8.5\" side, stop 1/4\" early on the non-flush end.\nMagenta pt 2 - picture 5 shows closer up what this means and where to stop sewing 1/4\" early.\nPicture 6: I have sewed as much as I can without doing the \"funky sewing\". This picture shows that we have a large zig zag piece and we need to sew in the light pink KD section.\nFirst, flip the block over and line it up, right sides together, with the appropriate edges touching. I flipped the light pink KD over the vertical axis. Then I sewed down the vertical seam.\nPicture 8: This is what the stitching looks like after being opened up.\nThen flip the light pink KD section over the horizontal axis, line up the appropriate edges - right sides together -and sew the length of the edges.\nContinue on until all the quadrants are pieced and then repeat with the entire quilt.

I didn't want the quilt to be overwhelming cluttered, so before adding on the scrappy border, I sewed on a 1.5\" white rose fabric border (white rose is the Kappa Delta symbol). The final white border is 1\".\nTo create the scrappy border, I first picked out the greens, whites, light grays, and dark grays that I wanted to see more of. To decide on the width, I needed to make sure my finished top would fit on the batting and backing. (Currently, the quilt is about 80\"x85\" without borders.) Therefore, the top had to be under 104\" (well, under 108\" backing, but I like to leave myself wiggle room). Because of my dimensions, I knew I needed 4.5\" strips.\nI started by cutting a bunch of 4.5\" interfacing strips (so 4.5\"x 20\"). Then I ironed the interfacing to the t-shirts and cut 4.5\" strips. I took the strips and cut all different lengths so the border was extra scrappy and random.

If it's too wide then my pants become baggy, but if the strip is not wide enough then they are too skinny which brings me back to where I started!\nTo measure, I first roughly fit the pants around my legs and figured out how much wider I needed them to be. I ended up deciding that 3 extra inches would give me a comfortable width, so I need to cut the strip to be 3.5 inches wide so that I can have about 1/4th an inch for seam allowance.\nAfter cutting out two strips 3.5 Inches wide by about 33 Inches long, I sewed them together to make one long strip that was about 65 inches in length! This gave me plenty of room for error, and because I sewed the strip from the middle, (starting at the crotch area and working my way down) I was able to just cut off the extra length down by my ankles in the end.\nPro Tip!: When sewing, be sure that you are stitching the \"wrong sides together\".

We will start with pinning the strip into the inside of the pants, to do this I am going to flip the pants outside out and begin pinning! (wrong sides together)\nWhen pinning the inner strip, I found that it is best to start at the middle most top point of the pants (crotch area). This is so that there will be a little bit of extra fabric hanging down on each side near the ankles, rather than having a LOT of extra fabric hanging down on one side!\nHere's a Pro Tip when pinning: Placing the pins horizontally will ensure that you don't need to take out each pin when sewing. Because the pins are so thin and pointed horizontally (left to right as opposed to up and down) the needle of the sewing machine is able to sew right over them without skipping a beat!\nOnce you're done pinning, just run it through the machine! This should be easy because your pins are in place and everything is lined up. When sewing, I first used a very wide straight stitch. I did this because using a wide stitch makes it easier to take out with a seam ripper if you make a mistake. After I tried it on and found that it fit the way I wanted, then I went over it with a zigzag stitch to lock it in!\nAgain, be sure to watch my video or ask a question if you need something cleared up!", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 5: Sew the Strip to the Inseam!"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Woohoo!

Depending on whether it is a knit or crochet slipper and how stretchy it is, you may need to do this step with your foot in the slipper. As these were very bulky, not too stretchy crochet slippers, I could get away with putting my foot in the slipper on the paper then carefully removing my foot before tracing. In the past though I have added soles to knit slippers with a lot of stretch to them. In this case, you would need to be wearing the slipper to stretch it to the proper size before you trace it (as the suede will not have stretch to it when it is added).\nTrace around the outside of the slipper with a pencil. When you have gone all the way around the slipper you can remove it from the paper and smooth up the outline of the slipper so it is nice and even.\nNow that I have the outline of the soles, I like to add two things to my template that are optional. I like to have the suede wrap up a bit over the toe end of the slipper, so I add a little bit at the top for that. I also make a separation between the top of the slipper and the bottom (with about 3/4 - 1 inch separation). Because the suede will not stretch, this give a little bit of stretching wiggle room to the slipper after the sole is attached. The separation should happen a little closer to the back of the slipper (not right in the middle) , the heel section will be smaller than the front section. I like to round the edges where I've created the separation.\nOnce you have your template sketch finalized go over it with a marker or pen. If you have a lot of extra pencil lines this makes things less confusing when you start to cut it out. If you've created separation between top and bottom you will need to note that on the pieces. If you are making soles for several different slippers at the same time, you should note on the template which set it belongs to. (In this case, I was making a set of 3 slippers in small, medium and large for guest use. Size medium is shown in this instructable)\nCut out your template pieces.

Depending on the slipper you are using you can try to line it up with the rows of the slipper to get a straight even edge. Next, I take the top piece and attach it to the middle of the toe end. My sole is made to slightly wrap around the toe end of the slipper. Then I attach the separation edge of the top, making sure that there is some space between the top and bottom to allow for some stretch. Lastly, I attach it in a few places along the sides of the slippers to keep everything in place while I sew it together. I pin both soles into place before I start sewing so I can make sure that they look the same.\nUsing a yarn needle and yarn, sew the soles to the bottom of the slippers. I used the same yarn that I made the slippers with so that it blends in, but if you are looking for a contrast you could use a different colour of yarn. I sewed the pieces on in the same order that I attached them to the slipper with the pins (starting with the middle of the heel and the middle of the toe.

If at all possible, do this OUTSIDE. I tried but my tealight kept blowing out, so instead I did this right next to an open window. This method creates smoke so make sure you have good ventilation.*\nUse your brush to apply a good layer of glue to the top of the paper leaf. Try to get right to the edges.\nHold the leaf as flat as you can in your metal tweezers. I only had a crocodile clip contraption to do this with, but tweezers would have been easier!\nCarefully move the paper leaf over the flame. Put the paper right onto the flame, making sure the glue-covered side is facing downwards. Constantly keep the leaf moving.\nFocus on a small area at a time, and every few seconds check to see which areas of the glue have been blackened. The idea is to blacken the entire glued surface and get rid of the white colour of the glue.\nIf you hear sizzling, that's good because it means the glue will be bubbling in the flame, but don't keep the same bit sizzling for more than a second otherwise it could catch fire.\nThe main problem I had was with the edges catching light, so only briefly flame the edges. The glue protects the paper, but at the edges the flame can reach the bare paper on top of the leaf, which can then set alight - and the result can be seen in one of the photos above! If this happens, dunk it into your container of water. This is why we make spares :)\nThen repeat the same for every leaf. This is a bit time consuming!\nNOTE: If both sides of your paper shapes will be visible in your project, you will need to repeat the process for the other side of the shapes as well (rather than just the fronts).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVZ/809O/JSSU2W2E/FVZ809OJSSU2W2E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAR/A33V/JSSU2W30/FARA33VJSSU2W30.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR2/0KBT/JSSU2W4X/FR20KBTJSSU2W4X.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZX/BMMO/JSSU2W9N/FZXBMMOJSSU2W9N.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHA/40CW/JSSU2WAS/FHA40CWJSSU2WAS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFM/MZL0/JSSU2WCF/FFMMZL0JSSU2WCF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9T/V4RY/JSSU2WDF/F9TV4RYJSSU2WDF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVG/SJRL/JSSU2WDX/FVGSJRLJSSU2WDX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Flame the Paper"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Next, you simply take a folded up piece of paper kitchen roll and rub the blackened surfaces of the leaves.\nYou only need to do this for 5-10 seconds - just to remove any excess black soot and 'buff' the paper to a shinier finish.\nDo the same for all the leaves.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FAV/GT07/JSSU2WED/FAVGT07JSSU2WED.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB6/D8FG/JSSU2WET/FB6D8FGJSSU2WET.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCL/277H/JSSU2WF9/FCL277HJSSU2WF9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: 'Polish' the Leaves"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "This is an optional step, but I think it looks nice :)\nI put a small amount of gold acrylic paint onto a piece of folded-up kitchen roll and used it to apply a very small amount to each leaf.

There are 192 squares in the sample bedspread. Do the math, that\u2019s a lot of yarn ends to weave in and you do this securely. Make it a practice to weave these in as you crochet each square, unless the pattern says not to (see video). This way, there will be only one yarn end to weave in - the last yarn end, on each square.\nI didn't realize this in the beginning. For the first squares I made, they all have 8 tails to weave in. My strategy was to run the finish end to the beg end of the same color, tie a square knot, run in more following stitch pattern on the back and then clip ends.\nStart with the finish end (yarn end hanging on the edge in this case).\nFold the very end of the yarn end on needle to flatten it so it doesn\u2019t split when you try to thread, Thread your tapestry needle, follow stitch pattern on the back, run in the finish end to the beg end that\u2019s worked over by the dcs. Tie a square knot, thread both ends to tapestry needle, run in more stitches, go in and come out the other side of dcs on corner. Clip yarn ends. Be very careful, don\u2019t cut stitches.\nFinish weaving in the remaining yarn ends the same way.\nAgain the smartest way to do is to weave in yarn end as you crochet by holding the yarn end together with the working end.

This will be your gauge. Mine was 4.5\u201d.\nBedspread size Measure and decide what size you want your bedspread to be. I wanted mine to be 58\u201d by 76\u201d\nSquares total Calculate how many squares you need to make for the size of the bedspread you want. Mine was12.8 squares by 16.8 squares. I decided to round off to 12 squares by 16 squares, 192 squares in total. You can always use edging to make up to the size.\nYarn total Divide your squares total by the rnds that one 100g skein of worsted yarn can make for the rnd (91 rnds for the first color, 57 for the second, 41 for the third, and 29 for the fourth), you get the answer (estimation) for how much yarn you need to buy for each color.\nYarn for 1st rnd, 100g skein of worsted yarn makes 91 rnds, 192/91 = 2.1, round off to 2, I did use exactly 2 of 100g yarn skeins to make 192 rnds of the first color. Calculate yours.\nYarn for 2nd rnd, 100g skein of worsted yarn makes 57 rnds, 192/57 = 3.4, round off to 4, I did use 4 of 100g yarn skeins to make 192 rnds of the second color with some left over. How much will you need?\nYarn for 3rd rnd, 100g skein of worsted yarn makes 41 rnds, 192/41 = 4.7, round off to 5, I did use 5 of 100g yarn skeins to make 192 rnds of the third color with a little bit left over. How much will you need?\nYarn for 4th rnd, 100g skein of worsted yarn makes 29 rnds, 192/29 = 6.6, round off to 7, I did use 7 of 100g yarn skeins to make 192 rnds of the fourth color with a little bit left over. How much will you need?\nYarn for Edging When you complete joining all the squares (192 in this sample), you do edging around the whole bedspread. There were 53 squares around in this pattern. But you only need to work on one of the four sides of the 53 squares. You can do 1, 2, 3 or how many rnds of edging you need to. I did 2 rnds in this pattern. I used same color for edging as the last rnd of the sqaure, 53/4*2 = 26.5, round it off to 27, the amount of yarn needed to do edging is equivalent to make 27 rnds of the last rnd of the square, 27/29 = 0.9, round it off to 1. So I used about 1 skein (100g) of yarn of the 4th color on edging.\nYarn for Fringe How much yarn needed to do fringe depends on the following factors: height of the fringe (12.5\u201d in the sample), multiply by 2 (yarn strand is folded in half to the height), stands of yarn per fringe (2 strands was used in the sample), space between fringes (fringe in every space and between stitches) or in another word, total fringes for the end(s) you will fringe (I did for one long end of the bedspread in the pattern, total fringes for the end is 208), so I used 12.5*2*2*208 = 10400 inches of yarn for fringe. One skein of the yarn used in the project has 210 yards, that\u2019s 7560 inches, 10400/7560 = 1.4, So it was 1.4 skein of yarn for fringe.\nNotes: The measurements and numbers above are project specific, you substitute them with yours.

There are plenty of examples of easy sew pants on Pinterest and the like. These generally rely on the pants being made from two pieces - so the back and the front are the same shape. These pants are a little more complicated than those, but more comfortable in the end!\nMaking a pattern is useful if you want to make more than one set of pants. It also makes it easier to get the design right as the paper will not move and fold like a pair of pants does when you try and arrange it and cut around it. If you are feeling confident you can go right ahead and use your pants as a pattern and skip this step. If you do this, remember to allow for seams so cut a cm or so wider than the actual pants.\nWhen making this pattern I rolled out the paper on a rug and use pins to hold the paper and the pants in place while I drew around them - stops things moving but not necessary!\nFind your most comfortable pair of pajamas or tracksuit pants and turn them inside out.\nFold them so that you have one complete piece of fabric facing up - with seams all around. Generally these pants are made from four panels - the back and front of each leg - so if you fold them in half and lay them down, you can reasonably easily arrange the pants so that the seams are on the outside edge like the first photo above.\nDraw around the edge of the pants, giving yourself an extra cm or two along the edges and a couple of cm at the top and bottom. This is called seam allowance and allows for the fabric that will be used when sewing the pieces together. Note: You will need to make an allowance for the elastic around the waist of your pants when making the pattern. I laid the pants out so the majority of the leg was straight up the edge of the paper. At the top the elastic will pull the fabric away from the edge - don't draw this bit in - start drawing at the top of the pants and leave the long outsdie edge straight up.\nRepeat for the panel - if the one you have done is one of the front panels, make sure the second one you do is a back panel!

Today, I\u2019m going to share two ways that you can use sewing to help to winterize your home and keep you warm.

There\u2019s one in particular that doesn\u2019t close completely and I\u2019d like to be able to close it off in the winter to divert heat to other parts of the house. Sometimes, I need to have it closed because I use that space to cure some candy (which can take three days) and I don\u2019t want dust blowing on it. You may have a vent that has a broken lever or is painted in position. Either way, I\u2019ll show how to make your very own magnetic vent cover.\nThe second project to help winterize your house is how to make a faucet insulator. This is super important to have when temperatures get below freezing. I made mine to assist my elderly neighbor who didn\u2019t have a proper insulator.\nThese projects are fairly easy if you are a beginner sewer.

It\u2019s cute, fun, and totally cozy.\nAnd it\u2019s surprisingly easy to crochet.\nThis project is a greatly simplified variation of the Mermaid Tail Throw by Mary Maxim, Pattern #98999N.\nThe craft kit is available from https://www.marymaxim.com/catalog/product/view/id...\nOn sale at $28.99, the original craft kit includes the necessary three colors of yarn: 18 ounces of wisteria, and 12 ounces each of blue and green.\nIt is a project that requires at least \"intermediate\" skill.\nThe Simple Mermaid Throw is an improved version that is also much easier to crochet.", "title": "Simple Mermaid Throw", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-Mermaid-Throw/", "section": "craft", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "For this Instructable, I simplified the Mermaid Tail Throw by using only two colors of yarn. One is called Wildflower. It\u2019s variegated with soft hues of blue, green, pale yellow, and teal. The other is a solid color called Dark Violet. Both yarns are available from Walmart. I used 18 ounces of each color.\nI chose the colors from yarn I already had on hand. Any pair of colors can be used that go together well.\nThe variegated yarn substitutes nicely for two different yarn colors and makes an attractively subtle pattern that looks pleasantly aquatic. Having two strands of yarn rather than with three makes the Simple Mermaid Throw faster and easier to crochet.\nTo make it even easier I changed the pattern of Rows into modules: two-Row modules for the flipper and four-Row modules for the body. The modular system is very easy to understand and keep track of.\nIn addition, I modified the stitches to make the Rows simpler, so the throw is easier to crochet overall.\nThe stitch originally used in the body looks very nice, but I found the instructions rather difficult to decipher, and the stitch itself hard to maintain. The original Mermaid Tail Throw is not an easy project.\nI made another major change by making the flipper out of two identical fin shapes, stacked and edged together, rather than from just one layer.\nThe original single-layer flipper had was decorative, but had no practical function. It was \u201cfloppy/droopy\u201d and attached to the bottom of the body with a heavy gathered seam. The two-layer flipper is much more substantial and attaches smoothly. It\u2019s also hollow, which not only provides a perfect cozy pocket for Little Mermaid feet but makes the flipper amazingly expressive.\nI was delightfully surprised the first time my Little Mermaid said hello by flapping her flipper at me. It was very lifelike. She has since developed an interesting collection of flips, flaps, and flumps to convey fine nuances of feeling\u2014and keep me laughing.\nThe Simple Mermaid Throw is made from two easy pieces: the body, which has a rectangular upper portion and a tapered lower portion, and the flipper, which is made from two identical fin shapes that stack and are edged together.\nI made the flipper first.\nI used a size H-8 (5.0 mm) hook for the fin shapes and a size I-9 (5.5 mm) hook for the body. I used a small pair of scissors to cut the yarn as needed. I also used four size 2 (1.5\u201d) safety pins to pin the fin shapes together as I edged them, and to pin the flipper to the body as they were being edged together.\nThe smaller stitches from the H-8 hook make the flipper extra warm and comfortable for Little Mermaid feet.\nThis project is a snap for someone who already knows how to do basic crochet. If you can chain, make rows, make the basic stitches, increase, decrease, and back-loop, you\u2019re pretty much good to go.\nFour basic stitches are used in this project, in addition to the usual starting chain:\nSC means Single Crochet\nDC means Double Crochet\nHDC means Half Double Crochet\nTC means Triple Crochet.\nAlways turn the piece over (TO) at the end of each Row to continue.\nYou\u2019ll be alternating colors every two Rows, but you won\u2019t need to cut the yarn each time. Just let each color dangle and then pick it back up when you need it again\u2014which will always be exactly two Rows later.\nAll of the short bare lengths of yarn along the outside edges of the piece will be neatly covered over by the edging when the Simple Mermaid Throw is finished.\nAlways cut and tie off the yarn as you finish with each color, and don't forget to bury the tails.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FGU/4S2X/JSL3CU71/FGU4S2XJSL3CU71.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPV/X919/JSL3AN69/FPVX919JSL3AN69.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Starting Simple"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The fin shapes use two-Row modules throughout that always alternate in color.\nStart with a chain of 40 stitches in Dark Violet. The fin shape is made sideways with the starting chain at the top.\nThe chain runs from the left upper point of the fin to the flat edge at the right that will eventually be joined to the bottom of the body. Don\u2019t worry about shape at this point. As the Rows progress, they will automatically give the pieces their proper finny shape.\nThe first two-Row module is done in Dark Violet. The Rows are designated F1 and F2. Each Row back-loops into the Row that precedes it. This being the first two-Row module, the F1 Row back-loops into the starting chain.\nBack-looping gives the flipper an interesting texture.\nRow F1 is a sequence of 10 SC, 10 HDC, and 20 DC.\nRow F2 is a full-length Row of DC back-looped in each stitch of Row F1.\nThat completes the first flipper module. The color of each flipper module alternates, so switch to Wildflower for the second flipper module.\nStarting with the second flipper module, each F1 Row decreases by one stitch at the left end. The F2 Rows are always the same length as the F1 Rows that precede them. This decrease is what curves the fin shape in on the top half of left end.\nContinue the decreasing flipper modules until you have completed 10 two-Row modules.\nThe last decreasing flipper module will be done in Wildflower.\nFrom there, stop decreasing and make 2 more two-Row modules. That makes the center strip of the fin shape.\nAfter the center strip, start increasing the two-Row modules.\nEach F1 Row is increased one stitch at the left end. This increase is what curves the fin shape out on the bottom half of the left end.\nEach F2 Row is always the same length as the F1 Row that precedes it.\nMake a total of 10 increasing two-Row modules. That will make the piece nicely symmetrical. It will be about 12\u201d wide at the right end.\nThe last increasing flipper module will be done in Dark Violet.\nThat finishes the first fin shape.\nMake two identical fin shapes, then stack them with their back sides together.\nUse the safety pins to hold them in alignment, then stitch the curved sides of the fin shapes together with one Row of SC edging done in Dark Violet, removing the pins as you go.\nLeave the straight side open.\nThat completes the flipper.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8E/D0RG/JSPAAI6J/F8ED0RGJSPAAI6J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FW7/BS9D/JSPAAI4M/FW7BS9DJSPAAI4M.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Make the Flipper"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Working from top to bottom, start with Dark Violet and make a chain of stitches 42\u201d long.

What could I make with only things I already had in the house? Items used to fabricate this jacket have been scraps of leather I had saved up over the years, some remnant cloth, and a used YKK zipper. The rivets were probably the only items used that weren't given a second life.\n\nSEWING MACHINES\nThere's a misconception that you need to be rich to afford equipment that will allow you to make beautiful luxury goods. It's not necessarily true, but specialized machines do give you better results. However, you can get away with sewing lightweight leathers on your average home sewing machine. There are some long term cons in doing so, but if it's a one time project or you're just testing the waters, use what you've got. I started off with a $200 Kenmore sewing machine then went to a Singer Heavy Duty ($230). And for the people who still don't believe me, everything on my fashion Instagram page: @jessica.barter has been sewn on the Singer machine. I'm not saying the Singer Heavy Duty was an amazing machine because it wasn't. It broke 4 times in a short span of 5-6 years, but I'm also very aggressive with my tools. Anyways, what I'm trying to say is you can still get away with making a couple of intricate pieces before the timing on your machine seizes. I've upgraded to a JUKI Exceed HZL-F600 ($1049) since. Pricier, but more convenient. You don't need fancy tools, just a vision, and passion.\nIt's important to note, that you'll need an open-toed walking foot attachment to make running the leather through easier on home sewing machines. Teflon feet don't work as well.", "title": "HOW TO MAKE a LEATHER JACKET OUT OF SCRAPS", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/HOW-TO-MAKE-a-LEATHER-JACKET-OUT-OF-SCRAPS/", "section": "craft", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "If you're making your jacket out of full skins, then you don't have to worry about this part.

It's a meticulous task, but if you take the time to check your work, it'll pay off in the sewing process.\nSTEP 1:\nStart with your basic block. If you don't have one or are new to patterning, take a basic well-fitted shirt that doesn't stretch and use it as a template. You're going to transfer the different pieces that comprise your shirt onto paper. For beginners, it's easier to deconstruct the shirt, so there's no guesswork. For more seasoned sewers, you can use a fabric weight and a tracing wheel to transfer the basic block over.\nSTEP 2:\nDraw your cut lines onto the block. I like keeping a blueprint of the design, so I trace the pattern pieces onto a separate sheet of paper and add on the seam allowance. This method takes longer but keeps you more organized. You always have something to refer back to, in case you lose a pattern piece or forget to label/notch a piece. If you're in a hurry or this is a one-time use project, feel free to just cut the pieces out directly and tape additional paper onto the borders for seam allowance. DON'T FORGET TO LABEL YOUR PATTERN PIECES.\nA general rule is 1/2\" all around and 1/4\" on inclosed seams like necklines and cuffs. Those guidelines can change based on your design or if you're from a different country.\nSTEP 3:\nTrue up your patterns. Truing up your patterns or walking them is the process of aligning pieces that will be sewn together to check if they will sew together correctly. It allows you to see if you have an excess length on one pattern piece or not. If you do, then you're going to have to correct it, either by increasing the length on the opposing pattern piece or by finding the difference between the two. During this part, you also want to notch your pattern pieces. Notching is the act of putting visual registration marks on your pattern piece, so when you go to sewing it, you have indicators to align the seams. When you're done, it should look something like the picture with all the pattern pieces laid out on the floor.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F5P/YVPY/JSIUO8O6/F5PYVPYJSIUO8O6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2S/JKES/JSIUO8O7/F2SJKESJSIUO8O7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGM/FW91/JSIUO8PL/FGMFW91JSIUO8PL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: PATTERN MAKING"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "For larger basic pattern shapes, put a fabric weight down on the pattern pieces backside and cut it out with a rotary blade.

If you're using a medium weight, you want to skive some of the thickness off the areas where the seam allowance will be. This will help prevent bulk in the sewing process and ensure it runs through your machine.\nFor padding detail, cut some foam out slightly larger than your pattern piece without seam allowance.

Mark the top of the zipper webbing where it bisects the sew line on the top pattern piece.

The nipper pliers are the ones that look like a stumpy hammerhead shark. These pliers work best for removing zipper teeth. Other pliers work but aren't as efficient.

Sew it in place with the usual seam allowance (measured from the edge of the patchwork, not the total width if the blanket is bigger). Repeat with the other long strip. Then wrap the strip around the edge of the blanket, folding the edge inward. It should go a little past (by 1/8\" or so) the sewn line on the back of the blanket. Pin it in place, and sew another line where the border and the patchwork meet (\"stitch-in-the-ditch\"). It should go through the border fabric on the back to hold it in place, while not being noticeable on the front.\nDo a similar thing with the shorter strips, except their ends should overhang the edges of the blanket, rather than stop at them. After sewing the strip to the front, fold the ends over to hide the rough edges (see the fifth photo), before folding the strip around the edge as with the long strips.

Just make sure to buy extra fabric if you think you might want to play with the size. More on fabric in the next steps.\nThe most important tool you\u2019ll need for a successful rag quilt is a very sharp scissor. They make special scissors for rag quilting, but you don\u2019t need them unless you plan on making a lot of quilts. Of course this project will go much faster with a sewing machine, though you can hand sew with needle & thread if you choose.

I like to choose contrasting colors and a variety of patterns and solids. How much you need depends on the size of your quilt. I like to err on the side of caution, so I tend to buy more fabric then I will need.\nHere is my general rule of thumb: After you\u2019ve decided on a quilt size, figure out how many square inches it will be. (Just multiply length x width) Now add another 50%. This will be approximately how much total fabric you need for one side. Remember, you\u2019ll be piecing together squares from multiple fabric cuts, so you need extra in case the number of squares don\u2019t work out perfectly with the fabric with you have chosen. Then you will need to do the same thing for your fabric on the back of your quilt.\nIf you want a solid border around your quilt, purchase enough extra fabric to go around the length and the width without chopping those pieces into squares. You can always decide on the border at the end, and purchase your border fabric when you have your quilt done.\nSo, for a small 3\u2018 x 3\u2018 quilt, I make sure to have at least a yard and a half for the front and a yard and a half for the back of the quilt. I usually over-buy so that I have flexibility in my sizing and design. Flannel is cheap so the extra cost is negligible.\nNote: Cheating is OK\nYou can buy precut squares of flannel if you want to skip the steps of choosing your own combinations and cutting out squares. I\u2019ve never done this because I enjoy designing the pattern, but there\u2019s no reason not to. Just make sure that you are getting flannel, and that you have enough for your entire quilt. This is a much more expensive option than buying yardage and cutting the fabric yourself.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F8I/F8MC/JSL382AR/F8IF8MCJSL382AR.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Getting Started - Flannel"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Once I have the idea for my quilt, I like to go to the fabric store and begin by choosing one or two patterns that I love.

It\u2019s also OK to make the front and the back the same, if you want. Personally, I like to contrast the front and the back, but this is part of your creative choice.\nWhen first learning to make rag quilts, purchase equal amounts of each color or pattern for the front, adding up to at least the total you previously calculated. Do the same for the back fabrics.\n\nNot sure?

At least for your first couple of quilts, all the squares should be the same size.\nIf you don\u2019t have a quilt pattern in mind, the best thing to do is start by cutting an equal number of squares from each flannel pattern. You can cut squares with a scissor or a rotary cutter either on a ruled mat or by marking the fabric with something washable.

I'm The Redsmith, I'm a maker.\nA few days ago, my wife, my son and I were lucky enough to get tickets for the premiere of the movie How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World. We love the franchise and the movie was wonderful. It's the perfect ending for the trilogy. I highly recommend you to go and watch it.\nAs I was watching the movie, I started to wonder if I would be able to make Hiccup's helmet for my kid, and as soon as I got back home, I started working on this helmet. It took me a long time to figure out a design that would work from my memories and the few pictures I found online, but I think I got it pretty close to what you'll see in the movie.\nI used 2.4mm/6oz vegetable tanned leather for all the parts of the helmet, except the little spikes on the side, for which I used 2.2mm/5oz veg. tan. leather. There are many ways to make a helmet out of leather. Personally, I chose to wet the leather and to shape it on a mannequin head which is almost the size of my kid's head. The most difficult part was to carve the leather in order to make it look like dragons scales, but I think I managed to make fake dragon scales pretty well :)\n\nThe helmet is too small for me a slightly too big for my kid, which is a good thing, he'll be able to play with it for a long time as he grows up. It was a lot of work, but my kid loves it, so it was totally worth the time I spent on it.\nThis helmet is a unique piece, only made for my son. I don't have a pattern as I was prototyping it as I built it.\nBut here is how I built it.\nI made a full tutorial video that you can watch here :", "title": "Hiccup's Leather Helmet From How to Train Your Dragon: the Hidden World", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Hiccups-Leather-Helmet-From-How-to-Train-Your-Drag/", "section": "craft", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "For this build you will need:\nA mannequin foam head\nSome plastic cooking wrap\nSome duct tape\n2.4mm/6oz vegetable tanned leather\n2.2/5oz vegetable tanned leather\nBlack & red leather dye\nLeather neatsfoot oil\nLeather lacquer\nWaxed cotton thread\nSewing needles\nSewing pins\nA stitching pony\nA sewing meter\nAn x-acto knife\nA size 4 diamond hole punch\nA round leather punch\nTwo black rivets + rivet punch\nA wooden mallet\nA ballpoint stylus\nSome leather tracing paper\nA edge beveler\nA groover\nA stitching awl\nA nail file\nA swivel knife\nA beveler stamp\nA background stamp\nA clean sponge\nSome warm water\nThese are the tools I used for the build but some of them can be replaced by the tools you have at home.\nNow, let's get to it.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FL8/OM22/JSKOR0D0/FL8OM22JSKOR0D0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Get Ready"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "One of the critical part of the build is good preparation.\nThe foam mannequin head will help your draw the design and also for the wet forming of the sides of the helmet.\nI drew the horizontal and vertical lines on the mannequin head with a black sharpie, making sure the line were deep enough to be felt by the finder under a coat of cooking wrap and duct tape.\nThen I wrapped the head with cooking wrap to get the desired head size and with duct tape to be able to draw on it with a sharpie.

People are crazy about these, and at $125-$300 a blanket, you started wondering, is it all hype? Why would people pay that much for a blanket?\nThe underlying science of weighted blankets are that by applying pressure to the body they will increase the release of serotonin. Serotonin is a chemical in the body that promotes relaxation.\nThere are other names for weighted blankets, such as gravity blanket or therapy blanket. They are not a new thing, they have been used for ages. But they are super popular right now.\nDisclaimer: I am not a medical professional, I don\u2019t play one on TV and never intend to either. The information I am sharing is from personal experiences, internet research and discussion with people that have these blankets. I don't know everything, but I do enjoy making these blankets and so far those that have received them, seem to enjoy them.\nYou can learn a little more about the suggested benefits by a quick google search. Here is a site you can start with:\nhttps://www.sensacalm.com/blogs/news/benefits-of-weighted-blanket-therapy\nAnyway, all that mumbo jumbo aside, you might be reading this because you want to make or buy a weighted blanket. Hopefully I can provide more info on what goes into making the blanket and what works for me.\nWord for the wise, you can make a blanket in a weekend, but this is not a one hour project and materials are not cheap. In some cases you might have to purchase some materials online. If your planning to whip one out in an evening for $20 or $30 bucks, forget it. The fabric will cost you $25+ on the cheap side, weighted pellets or beads are $2-$4 a pound. Raw cost for me to make a throw size, weighted blanket with all material included is at least $75 and it takes me about 2 days. But that is part of why they sell for so much.

Too many colors, too wild of a pattern or too many textures all play with a person\u2019s senses. The purpose of the blanket is to relax and provide comfort. Someone with a severe sensory acuteness can find these things stressful, not relaxing. This is why a true therapy blanket is plain, made of cotton and solid colors.\nAre you making this for someone with anxiety issues or PTSD? Go a little on the heavy side. I have no science to support this, but my experience with those I have made blankets for that suffer from these \"restless\" types of disorders actually seem happier with blankets that weigh them down more. Something about being more grounded.\nThere is no one fabric, weight, size or color for everyone, but think about who you are making this for and you can get a good idea of what details to place at your highest priority.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBU/U6E1/JSITP5MW/FBUU6E1JSITP5MW.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: A Few Things Before You Start Sewing: User"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "When considering the fabric you want to use, think about the person you are making the blanket for.

But also think about some of these factors:\nAre they short, like me? In that case a long throw size is extra weight that hangs off the couch and pulls on my feet, thus I don't like it.\nAre they using this at night? A minkie or sherpa fabric will slide around and fall off the bed in their sleep. It is also warm and might be sweaty in their sleep.\nWill it be used as a throw blanket for the couch? They will want something to snuggle into, so maybe not a cotton or wool blanket.\nA few more things in mind:\nThe fabric will define the weighted pellets and/or if you have to line the blanket.\nSome people get pre-made blankets and open the seam on one side. I have done this, it worked great and cut down on cost. I have also gone to the local fabric store and purchased fabric, either way is fine.\nYou can use any type of fabric, some popular fabrics are minkie, sherpa, wool, polar fleece and cotton.\nRemember that you have to put the weight in the blanket so check the weave, you don\u2019t want the weighted pellets to drop through the fabric.\nIf the fabric you choose doesn't have a tight weave you need to plan to have a liner, like a extra length of muslin or cotton on the inside to hold the pellets in.\nOnce the weight is in the blanket, you don\u2019t want the fabric to droop, so buy quality fabric.\nSee more about fabric, under the fifth point, about the weight in a weighted blanket.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FZA/BJ2S/JSITP0HA/FZABJ2SJSITP0HA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: A Few Things Before You Start Sewing: Fabric"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "How do you know how heavy a weight blanket should be? Well the blankets should give the person using it the feeling of being relaxed. Too light, and it is just a blanket, too heavy and it is overbearing.\nThink of it this way, when the blanket is too heavy it is like going on a long walk, you feel fatigued and exhausted, essentially weighted down. At the right weight it will feel like a welcome hug, grounded and relaxed.\nHow do you find that weight? The magic number is 10% of a person's body weight, give or take 3 lbs. A child\u2019s blanket should never be more than 10 lbs, and are most often in the 5 lbs range. Weighted blankets are not recommended at all for pregnant woman.\nThe plus or minus 3 lbs is personal preference. As I mentioned earlier, my experience with those that have anxiety issues is that they seem to prefer a blanket that is a little on the heavy side, weighing them down more.\nI have no medical concerns and actually prefer a blanket that is on the light side. My husband who also has no medical concerns likes a blanket about exact to his weight.\nSo how do you know what to make? Well you can make multiple blankets and play with the weight, go to a craft fair and try out blankets someone else has made, or just make one to the 10%. The nice thing is if you make one to 10% and you don't like it, chances are your husband, parent, child, friend or neighbor will love it and you have an idea of what weight you want to make for the next one.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FH3/ZUHK/JSITOI6Z/FH3ZUHKJSITOI6Z.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: A Few Things Before You Start Sewing: Heavy"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The size you want the blanket to be is totally up to the person making the blanket and how the blanket is going to be used.

These are the same things used by our grandmothers for years to make all those cute little dolls with the heavy rear ends. How do you know what to use? Everyone you ask will have a list of do\u2019s and don\u2019t. There are lots of opinions and interpretations. Here is my breakdown:\nPoly Pellets: Poly is actually the brand name. This brand has been around since . . .well forever. These are plastic pellets, made of 100% polypropylene, hint the Poly part of the name. You can find many other brands of plastic pellets, but essentially, they are small round plastic pellets that create a uniform fill. They do have a texture like tiny pebbles. Many people have said to stay away from recycled pellets, something about their smell. I have never used recycled pellets so I can not speak to this.\nThese are NOT made of PET or PETE (polyethylene terephthalate), the dreaded bottle plastic. These are said to be safe.\nGlass Beads: Also like the name implies, these are truly glass beads, like what is used in a sand blasting cabinet. The weights and sizes of these beads vary from small pebbles to a thin sand. Choose wisely, they have to stay inside your blanket without sliding through the weave of the fabric. While these are glass, I have never heard any stories of the glass breaking or splintering, again said to be totally safe.\nA great resource for more info is https://thesleepstudies.com/glass-beads-plastic-pellets-for-weighted-blanket\nFYI I am not in any way affiliated with this website. I don't know who wrote it, but I found the info very helpful.\nWhether you choose Poly pellets or glass beads, it will make a difference in the fabric you use for your blanket and the overall feel of the blanket. Because Poly pellets are larger and plastic is lighter, you will need to use more pellets by quantity to get the same weight, but you can use a looser woven fabric. This will mean that the weight is visible when the blanket lays flat. The blue a grey blanket I am making for this, will be made with a version of Poly Pellets.\nUsing glass beads means a thinner profile for the blanket, so you may not actually see the weight in the blanket. But it also means that likely you will have to include a liner to keep the pellets from sliding through the weaves in the fabric, adding to cost. The all grey minkie blanket in some of my pictures was made with glass beads and includes a cotton liner.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTL/47KA/JSITOI53/FTL47KAJSITOI53.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: A Few Things Before You Start Sewing: Weight"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "When you pick your fabric, know your pellets, for my first project I used minkie and my glass pellets slid right through. I had to use a liner to keep the pellets in and that adds extra time and costs.\nIn a pinch, old sheets make a great liner, after all no one is going to see the material on the inside anyway.\nIf you use minkie fabric, just plan to use a liner.\nWeight is total weight, not just the pellet weight. Weigh the fabric before adding pellets. Otherwise your 18 lbs blanket will end up being 23 lbs after your done.\nAll pellets differ a little, so don\u2019t assume that 1 tablespoon will always weigh the same. Different manufacturers or materials will make an even bigger difference. You have to actually weigh each pocket as you go. You have to have a scale to distribute the weight evenly.\nGet a fabric with lines in the pattern, like a plaid. You might be great at sewing straight lines, but once your halfway through the blanket and there is some weight to one side, it will want to slide off the table. You will get tired of fighting it, and your lines will start getting crazy. The bottom and top fabric don\u2019t have to have lines, but if one does you will save yourself a lot of frustration.\nPlan a few extra inches of fabric on the top of the blanket, this will give you plenty of space for feeding the pellets and to sew the last line without having to vacuum up thousands of pellets later. Trust me, at least an extra 2 inches.\nWhen you are pouring the weight into the blanket, rest the blanket on a chair. Set the blanket in the chair, pour over the back of the chair, so the weight settles in the seat of the chair. If you have a swivel chair, or one on wheels this helps move the blanket around and saves some arm strength and back twisting. The 10 or 15 lbs of blanket will start feeling a million times heavier after moving it around for 2+ hours.\nTape the funnel to the wrapping paper roll. My hubby is a genius!\nIf you use polar fleece, cut off the rolled raw edge, it just leaves a lump in the blanket.\nPro Tip: If you cut it nice, you can use it as a \u201cribbon\u201d to wrap around the blanket. This looks nice if your giving the blanket as a gift.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRQ/L49P/JSITOGPK/FRQL49PJSITOGPK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F43/U8UJ/JSITOGQA/F43U8UJJSITOGQA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFW/20CT/JSITOBN0/FFW20CTJSITOBN0.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Important Things I Learned - Trial and Lots of Errors"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Must have:\nSewing machine\nThread\nScissors\nShipping scale (or food scale) that measures ounces\nScale (like the one from your bathroom) that measures pounds\nCup (I use a measuring cup)\nRuler\nFabric = 2 lengths (front and back) - see above for more on picking fabric\nPellets or beads - see above for that too\nFor this instructable I am making a long throw size.

But really, start out by doing the same steps you would do to make any simple two fabric blanket.\nTake right sides of the fabric and line them up together. You want right sides together, (that means that the sides you want to see when the blanket is complete are touching).\nThan sew a tight straight stitch along 3 of the 4 edges. You want to leave one side open for adding the pellets.\nWhen you sew, leave or 1/4\" to 1/2\" seam. If your blanket requires a liner, sew all 3 or 4 layers of fabric together at once. Put the liner fabrics on the outside, so when you turn the blanket right sides out, the liner will be in the inside.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what side of the blanket is left open - unless there are only lines (stripes) in the fabric running one direction, make sure you leave open the side with the lines running vertical, so you can sew on the line after weight is added. If it is plaid, than Bob\u2019s your Uncle.\nNow, turn the blanket right sides out, and lay the seam flat. You should now have three sides sewn together and one side open, like a pillow case.\nNow sew a small tight zigzag line around the 3 sewn edges. You are doing this for aesthetics. When you complete the 4th edge, you will not be able to turn the blanket inside out, thus you will fold in the fabric and close it with the same small tight zigzag line giving the blanket consistency all the way around.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPP/1S2R/JSITOLN9/FPP1S2RJSITOLN9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXV/KCBB/JSITOLWV/FXVKCBBJSITOLWV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO8/7H0L/JSITORU9/FO87H0LJSITORU9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ7/D632/JSITOCKG/FQ7D632JSITOCKG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Now Let's Get Started"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "To evenly distribute the weight, a grid of pockets is created that hold the weighted pellets in place. This way you don\u2019t get 10 lbs all in one corner of the blanket. These don\u2019t have to be squares, have fun, make them whatever fits your fabric, rectangle, triangle, duck shapes. Again there are a lot of opinions about how big or small each pocket should be. I feel this is defined by the material, what weighted pellets you use and just plan personal preference. Here is how I define my grid.\n1. Weigh the blanket, using the scale (like the one from your bathroom) that measures pounds to see how heavy the blanket is at this time. Write that number down. In the picture you can see my fabric weighs 3 lbs.\n2. Now lay the blanket out on the floor or table so you can see the whole blanket. Look at the fabric. If you have plaid or stripes measure the distance between the lines, I find that 4 to 6 inch squares are ideal. See how your blanket lays out using the patterns you have in the fabric. Don\u2019t set up the pockets to sew through the animals on the fabric when maybe you can sew a grid around them.\nI said that the pellets and personal preference also weigh in:\nIf your using Poly pellets, they are larger in size for the same weight. Thus your pockets will need to be large enough to fit the desired weight in each pocket of the grid. Glass beads can be very small but are heavier, so you get more weight with less mass. In the end you want the pellets to have enough space to lay flat in the pocket later, after you wash the blanket, you want to lay it flat to dry, so some space is a good thing.\nPersonal preference is all about you, do you want to sew and fill four hundred pockets with a \u215b oz of pellets or only one hundred pockets with \u00bd oz of pellets each? Obviously one hundred pockets is faster, but is it better? In my experience, big pockets are not better. When the weighted pellets have lots of room to move around, they do. And that takes away from the even distribution of weight. Thus I go for a 4\u201dx 4\u201d to a 5\u201d x 5\u201d square. Somewhere in this realm usually means around 200 pockets. Thus I keep my sanity and the weight distributes nicely.\n3. Don\u2019t sew anything yet, just get out a piece of paper and draw your plan. You will need vertical and horizontal lines to create the pockets/grid for the weight. Count how many horizontal pockets and how many vertical pockets you have and write that down. Take those two numbers and multiply them to know how many pockets you will make total. For instance if you have 14 horizontal pockets and 16 vertical pockets, you will have created 224 pockets.\n4. Now that you know the weight of the fabric in pounds, the number of pockets, and how heavy you want the blanket to be you can define how much weight goes in each pocket of the grid. See above in \"Step 3: A Few Things Before You Start Sewing: How Heavy\" if you need to figure how heavy you want the blanket.\nStart by taking how heavy you want the blanket to be and subtracting the current weight of the fabric to get the weight that needs added.\nLet\u2019s say the current fabric weight is 3 pounds. I want a 10 pound blanket. Thus I need to add 7 pounds.\n10 lbs - 3 lbs = 7 lbs\nSince there are 16 ounces in a pound, you can multiply the pounds needed by 16 to get total ounces to add.\nI need to add 7 pounds, times 16 equals 112 ounces.\n7 lbs X 16 = 112 oz\nDivide the number of ounces needed by the number of pockets to get how many ounces per pocket.\nI need to divide 112 ounces to 224 pockets, I need to add 0.5 ounces per pocket.\n224 / 112 oz = 0.5 oz\n5. Now go to your Shipping scale (or food scale) that measures ounces and actually measure out the ounces that go into one pocket. I am a visual person and this helps me see how much or how little I am adding. All pellets differ a little, so don\u2019t assume that 1 tablespoon will always weight the same. Different manufacturers or materials will make an even bigger difference. You have to actually weigh each pocket as you go, but for now this gives you a visual of what it will look like.\nNow we go back to personal preference, are you adding a 1/16th ounce of weight to 500 pockets? Do you really want to do that, would 1/8th ounce to 250 pockets make a difference? Look at the volume of pellets and the size of the pocket. Find the medium that feels good to you and flows with your fabric. Making 2\u201d X 2\u201d squares looks amazing, but will take way longer than 2 days to make. A 6\u201d X 6\u201d square might seem huge and sloppy or maybe it is the perfect fit for your fabric and pellets.\n6. Once you have played with the numbers and your fabric to find the grid that works for you, take the Embroidery Tape (blue tape of you don\u2019t have embroidery tape) and mark your lines. Just a small piece of tape at the line you will start on is enough if your fabric has stripes.\nIf your fabric does not have lines to follow for sewing, you will need to use a fabric pen to draw lines for sewing, draw the lines all the way across the fabric. See the attached image, draw both the red and the blue lines, creating your complete grid.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJD/1SHG/JSITOCOI/FJD1SHGJSITOCOI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FMD/KV6R/JSITOCWY/FMDKV6RJSITOCWY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUH/H6WS/JSITOW94/FUHH6WSJSITOW94.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSU/DPWR/JSITOGNU/FSUDPWRJSITOGNU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBF/997V/JSITOGNP/FBF997VJSITOGNP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAG/9NM0/JSITOCYC/FAG9NM0JSITOCYC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F40/PT62/JSITOD0Y/F40PT62JSITOD0Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKY/LPRK/JSITOD2H/FKYLPRKJSITOD2H.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: The Grid and the Weight"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "Now that you have had a mental drain from figuring out the size of the blanket, how the grid will lay, how big the pockets will be, the weight and size of the blanket and all that other jazz; you are ready to lean back and just sew.\nStart by sewing a tight straight stitch for all the horizontal lines on the blanket, these are the blue lines on the attached picture. The horizontal lines run the length of the blanket and end at the open side. These stitches need to be tight enough that pellets cannot travel between the stitches and end up in a different pocket.\nLeave a few inches between your final stitch and the end of the fabric.

You are going to fill each of these pockets with the desired weight of pellets per one pocket. In this example, you are adding 0.5 oz to each line/pocket.\nTo make this easier, take an old wrapping paper tube, tape a funnel on the top. Shove it down the first pocket and than pour the pellets in the funnel. This will assist guiding the weighted pellets to the bottom of the blanket. This way you don\u2019t have to shake the pellets down, and they end exactly where you want them.\nNow remove the tube from the first pocket, go to the next pocket and repeat until all the pockets from one row are filled.\nAfter one row has been filled, sew the same type of tight straight stitch across the vertical line as you did the horizontal lines, closing the pocket. This is the lowest red lines in the attached drawing. FYI your sewing machine will be unhappy if the needle hits a pellet, so guide the pellets out of the way with your fingers if you have too.\nNow start the next row of pockets, one row at a time. Fill each of these pockets with the desired weight of pellets per one pocket, after one row has been completed you will sew across the vertical line, closing the pockets on the second row and moving to the third . . . continuing until you are at the last row.\nPro Tip: When you are pouring the weight into the blanket, rest the blanket on a chair.

In this case my solid grey fabric is longer than my print fabric so I trim the solid grey fabric so it is close to the same length as the print fabric.\nNow, while sitting at your sewing machine, pour the pellets in the pocket, one pocket at a time. Sew that pocket closed and than pour the weight in the next pocket. Depending on how big the pockets are, you may have to fill two pockets at a time, due to the neck width of the sewing machine (room between the needle and the edge of the machine as the fabric runs).\nThe other trick with these pockets, are that you are closing the blanket at the same time you are adding the weights. This is why you left an extra few inches of fabric. Pour the pellets in the pocket, fold the fabric right sides together, creating the binding and than sew a small tight zigzag line looking similar to what was sewn on the other 3 sides.\nAdd pellets to the next pocket and continue to the end of the blanket.\nDONE!!

I did not need to have the pedals raised higher off the floor but you can build with thicker materials if desired.\nInstead of using power tools and kicking up a lot of debris and dust when cutting particle board kind of stuff, you can deeply score the hardboard with a utility knife and snap it on the line to break and separate, just like drywall. Cut the line deep or else the material might rip a ragged edge or tear out a random piece from either side.\nI used some 1/2 inch x 2 inch craft wood strip stock to form the sides.\nLay out your foot pedals and use a small scrap piece of stock pushed up against the sides of your foot pedal and as a spacer between the foot pedals to mark out exactly where you need to cut. No need to use exact ruler measurements. Cutting a hair bigger or outside the marked line will give enough play for the foot pedal to fit in...or else trim/sand later to make it fit.\nPieces are cut to frame out the pedal and make the holding compartment for each.\nGlue the first piece on. When dry, test fit the next piece and mark the position so you can apply glue and glue it on.\nClamp for even contact between the hardboard and wood pieces.

Wire flush cutters work surprisingly well for wood.\nA wood rasp, surform tool, edge radius rounding slickplane, file, and sandpaper will handle the rest of the shaping and finishing. Use the sanding dust to mix with glue for filler if you find any large voids that may appear, especially at the glue joints. I did not cut everything exactly square with the hand saw and did not glue precisely.\nSince the foot pedals are under the table out of sight, I can probably memorize which pedal is which but I added a texture under the sewing machine foot pedal for more positive tactile feedback that I am stepping on the correct pedal.

You know.\nThey would always look for warm spots to take a nap, because ferret fur isn\u2019t very thick, and they would get cold easily. So I\u2019d make little tents, covered hammocks, tunnels, and things like that.\nI had so much fun designing this ferret house. I love the spikes, and the springy tail that looks like a medieval mace and has a squeaker inside. The monster body is held open with poly featherboning, to make it easy for the little fuzzbutts to crawl inside and snooze. The details like the teeth and spikes on the tail/spine were both for looks, and so that the ferrets would have more things to tug on.\nI will give the pattern away here as a free download to anyone who might want to make their own ferret monster, or if you would rather buy the monster that I made for this Instructable, you can do so on my blog. You can also use the methods in this tutorial to design a creature from your own imagination.\nThe completed sleeper is quite large (44\" long, including the tail), and I'd imagine that a small dog or cat could also use this to play in.

Most fleece in the fabric store is that wide, but check and make sure before you buy it.\nYou will need a small amount of fleece in a contrasting color for the teeth, claws, eyeballs, and spikes on the spine/tail. 1/4 yard of 57\u2033 wide fleece is plenty.\nYou also need basic sewing supplies (thread, scissors, etc), and if you are using a sewing machine, you will need to use a size 14 ball point needle. (Depending on where you live, it might be called a size 90 stretch needle.)\nI used a piece of 1\u2033 wide elastic that is 15\u2033 long, to make the tail springy. My ferrets loved boingy things. But if you want, you can omit the elastic and you\u2019ll have a longer, flatter tail.\nI used 2 yards of poly featherboning to hold the mouth open, so my little monsters could easily find their way inside the big monster. This is optional, but I think it makes the sleeping bag more practical. I chose poly because then you can throw the monster into the washing machine (machine washability is a must when I make a project for pets). (The link to the featherboning is an affiliate link, meaning that if you use it to make a purchase, I will earn a small commission at no extra cost to you.)\nI'm putting a squeaker in the tail, but you could use a rattle, or leave the noisemaker out entirely.\nThe monster eyeballs are open to interpretation, but make sure they aren\u2019t made out of anything that the ferrets could choke on (buttons seem like a potential choking hazard to me). I have included a pattern piece to make eyeballs out of your accent fabric.\nYou will also need access to a printer to print out the pattern, and tape to tape the pieces together.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FM6/AFI7/JSCG4BNO/FM6AFI7JSCG4BNO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Materials"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Print page 1 of the pattern at 100%, and page 2 at 400%. Page 2 should be tiled onto 16 sheets of paper. You will need to cut out the pieces from page 2, and tape them together into larger pattern pieces. Using the original file as your guide, cut on the lines, match everything up, and tape the pattern pieces together.\nFold the large piece of fleece in half, right sides together, with the two selvages (the edges that were not cut at the fabric store) meeting each other. You should have a piece that is about 30\u2033 by 36\u2033. Lay out the pattern pieces on the fabric as shown: One piece will be placed along the folded edge, and the others will be spaced out across the rest of the fabric.\nYou will need to cut out the legs 4 times, which will give you 8 pieces (because the fabric was folded to begin with.) Just cut out one leg at a time, and then move your pattern piece over to cut the other 3 legs, spacing them out like I\u2019ve shown in the picture. You should have plenty of fabric if you don\u2019t make your cuts too far apart. It\u2019s a good idea to pin the pairs of leg pieces together as you get them cut out, because you will sew them in pairs, and pinning them now will save some rearranging time later. Pin the tail pieces together, too.\nPage 1 of the pattern is printed at the correct size already, so just cut out all of the paper pieces on the line. The oval shapes are to make the ball at the end of the tail. You will need to cut 6 of the ovals out of the large fleece piece (so cut out the oval 3 times on the folded fabric, which will give you 6 ovals).\nThe other pieces from page 1 (a circle and two triangles) will be cut out of the other fabric. Fold your 1/4 yard of accent fabric in half, right sides together. The circles are for the monster\u2019s eyeballs, so you need to cut the pattern piece once out of your accent fabric (which gives you two eyeballs, because the fabric is folded).\nGo on to the next step to use the triangle-shaped pattern pieces.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FY3/8NFT/JSAOUKJ7/FY38NFTJSAOUKJ7.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKX/SPK2/JSAOUKJI/FKXSPK2JSAOUKJI.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Print the Pattern and Cut"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The triangles are for the teeth, claws, and spikes.

Leave some space in between the long edges of the triangles (about 1/2\u2033, or 1 cm will work fine) so that you can cut them apart after they\u2019re sewn. But you can trace the short ends right next to each other, or against the edge of your fabric, because the short side will not need a seam allowance.\nSew a V shape on the line, so that you\u2019ve sewn the long sides of the triangle, and left the bottom unsewn. Now cut all of the triangles out. Cut right on the unsewn line (the shortest line, the bottom of the triangle), but leave a small seam allowance on the two sewn sides.

Now take 3 of the small triangle shapes, and place them between the pieces of leg fabric, one at the end of each toe. The unsewn, short end of the triangle should be lined up with the cut edge of the leg fabric, and the tip of the triangle should be pointing in towards the foot.

So more pins is better, unless you\u2019re a seasoned seamer and feel like you\u2019ve got this.\nSew, starting at the shoulder end, all down one side, around each toe, and back up the other side towards the shoulder.

Leave 2\u2033 unspiked at the wide end, and 1\u2033 at the narrower end, so that you can sew those edges later on without spikes in your way. I think it looks cool to have more of the spike showing near the monster\u2019s head, and gradually have the spikes lower as you get towards the tail. If you like that look, just leave more of each spike sticking out of your \u201csandwich\u201d as you go towards the tail end.\nSew only the long, straight seam with the spikes in it.

This might seem a little bit tricky, but don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not as hard as it looks. Cut the featherboning into 5 pieces: two that are 8\u2033 long (20 cm), two that are 11\u2033 long (28 cm), and one that is 34\u2033 long (86 cm).\nYou will need to push an inch (2.5 cm) of plastic out of the fabric casing of each piece of featherboning and trim it off. Now trim the corners off both ends of the plastic, so that the tip of the plastic is rounded. (Trimming the inch off is so you can fully encase the plastic in the fabric casing, and rounding the ends is so that the corners of the plastic aren\u2019t sharp enough to poke their way out of the casing later on.) Now push the plastic back into the casing, and stitch 1/2\u2033 from each end of the casing to hold the plastic inside. Be careful not to stitch through the actual plastic, just the fabric casing.\nJoin the 34\" piece of featherboning into a circle by folding the ends of the casing under, overlapping the plastic by about an inch, and stitching the casings together like I\u2019ve done in the picture.

Place them against the wrong side of the fabric, with the convex side (outside curve) touching the fabric. The pattern tells you exactly where it goes.

They will cross over the 8\u2033 pieces at one end.\nSew through the fabric casing to attach the featherboning to the fleece. Use the stitching line on the casing itself as your guide, because if you sew on the original stitching line, then you know you won\u2019t be catching the plastic with your needle. Sew slowly, and hold down the featherboning with your fingers as you guide the piece through the machine. Remove your pins as you come to them, and stitch both sides of all 4 of the casings.\nI did stitch through the plastic in one spot, and I\u2019ve done it plenty of times in the past, too.

The cut edges should all line up, and the legs should be laying across the monster, pointing away from the center of the monster's body. Roll the legs up, and pin them to themselves, to keep the toes from being caught in the opposite seam when you sew. Put the tail in the same way, at the narrow end of the body.

I put some of the spikes higher and some lower in the seam, but you can do what suits you.\nAdd one more oval and spike, so that you have 3 ovals sewn together with 2 spikes. You will need to hold the first seam to one side while you stitch the second seam. Now repeat the process with the other 3 ovals, so that you have two halves of a spiky sphere. Place the two halves right-sides together, adding three more spikes in the seam, and pin. Now you can sew all 6 ovals together into a ball, but start stitching about 1/2\" away from the short end, so that you are leaving about an inch (2.5 cm) unsewn. There are a lot of seams converging at the tip of the ball, but just spread them out and then run over them, keeping with your 3/8\" seam allowance. Now turn the ball right-side out through the 1\u2033 opening.\nTake some small scraps of fleece, and stuff them inside the ball. I'm adding a squeaker, but that's optional.

Take a doubled length of thread and hand-sew a large running stitch (just a basic in-and-out stitch) around the edge like I'm doing in the picture. You should use matching thread, I'm just using contrasting thread so that you can see it better. Make one stitch past the point where you started, grab both ends of the thread, and pull the thread to draw the circle up into a gathered, 3-dimensional shape.
