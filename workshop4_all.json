I'm glad you asked. There's not much interesting about a a skinny ink pen that cost (almost) literally a dime a dozen. Because wood is a natural, organic material, each pen make from wood is truly unique. Another reason is because lathe work is very satisfying, and turning pens is a relatively easy way to get started.\nLet's talk about the tools and materials you'll need. (Incoming long list! Just stick with me, it's not as much as you think!)\nHardwood.\nThis instructable is going to feature Ironwood (AKA Lignum Vitae) which is the hardest wood in the world. However, you can use any type of hardwood you want, from domestically available oak, to exotic and colorful African hardwoods. However, I wouldn't really recommend softwoods like pine, poplar, or cedar, especially for a beginner. Hardwood pen blanks are easily found online for pretty cheap.\nA pen kit.\nThis is easily found in specialty woodworking shops like Woodcraft. If there isn't a woodworking shop in your area, you can find tons of different kits online. A quick google search should turn up a lot of results.\nAccess to a lathe.\nYou're probably thinking, \"I don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on specialized machines just to have a cool writing pen!\" and I'm here to say that you don't have to. You only need a mini or midi sized lathe for small spindle turning, and those lathes can be found as cheap as 100 bucks, especially if you buy used. You can also look into local makerspaces that have lathes, or ask around, and find someone who will let you use theirs. Make sure the lathe has a spindle adapter. This can be found for like 30 bucks online, and used for a lot more than just pens.\nBushings.\nThese are little metal spacers that show you how much material to remove. These are super cheap (like 2 bucks) and your pen kit will tell you which ones to get.\nLathe tools.\nYou only really need a spindle gouge and a smallish skew. Make sure they're sharp though!\nA drill press.\nYou don't need a big one. Access to a $100 benchtop press will do. You'll also need the appropriote sized drill bit, which will be specified in the pen kit instructions.\nA saw.\nThis could be anything from an old hacksaw to the fanciest of miter saws. Anything that can chop a 3/4\" piece of hardwood\nA vice.\nOr basically anything that can hold your pen blank perpendicular while you drill a hole in it. If you don't want to buy a vice, you can probably get creative with a few planks and a handful of clamps.\nA pen barrel trimmer. (optional)\nThis is a cool little tool that can be chucked onto the lathe or a drill press. I'll explain what this is for in a later step.\nCyanoacrylate Glue.\nOr CA glue. Basically, it's just superglue.\nSand paper.\nYou want as many grits as you can get your hands on. For this project, I used 150, 220, 320, 420, and a friction polish, but it's not a bad idea to use even more.\nA finish for you pen.\nYou can use a variety of finishes, and it's really up to what you want to use, and what you have access too. I'm using a shellac/wax finish, but you can use oils, polys, and you can even use that same CA glue we talked about.\nA pen makers press (optional)\nThis is a handy little jig that helps me assemble pens. It's just a simple press that I bought online for 30 or 40 bucks. You don't need one, but it helps. You can just carefully use a small hammer or a vice.\nA pencil.\nYes, you need a pencil to make a pen. I know...", "title": "Turning an Ironwood Pen on a Lathe", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Turning-an-Ironwood-Pen-on-a-Lathe/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Okay, we have a chunk of wood. Believe it or not, this will soon be the coolest pen you've ever owned! This is called the pen \"blank\" because it hasn't been shaped yet. The kit I'm using is the Executive ballpoint pen kit from Penn State Industries. The first thing we're going to do is cut the blank to length using any type of saw you have on hand. My tube is 2 inches long, so I'm going to cut the blank 2 1/8 inches, so we have a little leeway during the glue up. It should go without saying, but make sure you take all safety precautions like using eye and ear protection, proper saw usage, and adult supervision if you are a young woodworker!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F4Y/LYYQ/IOPZD8XR/F4YLYYQIOPZD8XR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUI/S790/IOPZD8Z2/FUIS790IOPZD8Z2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Cutting Your Blank"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Once it's cut, we need to drill a hold down the center for the brass tube. Before you drill, use a straight edge and a pencil to find the center point on the end of the blank. I use a pen-turners vice, but you can get creative a make it work without one. Now, drill right through that center point. Make sure to go slow! It's also a good idea to drill a little bit, and then retract the bit so the dust can escape, using the \"in-n-out\" method (not a technical term). If your vice and blank aren't clamped down securely, you need to do so!\nNow that your blank is cut and drilled, time to stick that brass tube in there. Pro tip: give that tube a quick sanding before you glue, so that the adhesive has a little more surface area to grab onto. You don't need to be conservative with that CA glue. Read the drying times on the glue packaging, and follow them.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FG7/D4WS/IOPZD8Z5/FG7D4WSIOPZD8Z5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCU/YZRV/IOPZD90I/FCUYZRVIOPZD90I.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Drilling and Gluing Your Blank"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Okay, our Ironwood is cut, drilled, and glued. Remember how I cut the blank a little proud (i.e. longer than the tube)? That gave us a little leeway during the glue up, but now we need to trim the blank to the exact size of the brass tube. You can use a fancy pen barrel trimmer (again, you can easily find this online) to do this quickly, or you can take a little more time and just cut and sand it down (carefully!)\nNow you want to affix this on the spindle of your lathe. Make sure you use all the proper bushings, and tightly screw the brass fastener at the end of the spindle. Also make sure you have secured the live center of your lathe, and have the tool rest at the correct height. At this point, make sure any loose hair is tied back, roll up long sleeves, and tuck in those little strings if you're wearing a hoodie. And definitely don't wear gloves. Lathes can be dangerous machines, and you don't want to take the risk!\nNow, it's time to turn your pen! Start by carefully taking off the corners with the a spindle gouge. You don't even want to look at the skew until your blank is completely round. Once your corners are completely rounded, you can get a little more aggressive with the material, if you're comfortable with it. Some turners can make a pen in like 5 minutes, but that doesn't mean you're doing it wrong if takes you well over an hour. Move at your own pace!\nOnce you have the rough shape you like, you can refine and shape the pen with the skew. You want to use a pretty light touch with the skew, to avoid a blowout. Now that you have your pen shaped, it's time to start sanding.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F0O/0IN4/IOPZD90J/F0O0IN4IOPZD90J.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB4/BXA2/IOPZD91W/FB4BXA2IOPZD91W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJG/45IC/IOPZD91Y/FJG45ICIOPZD91Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBM/WZI3/IOPZD93B/FBMWZI3IOPZD93B.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Turning Your Pen"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "You'll want to use the lowest grit, and gradually move through the higher grits. So I start by sanding the pen with 150 grit while the lathe is on. Then I turn it off and give it a quick sanding with the grain to remove the machine marks. I do that for each grit, and generally, you can't spend too much time sanding. Once you get to the higher grits, it feels a little redundant, but I promise it's worth it!\nAfter sanding, I apply the friction polish. I do this by wiping it on while the lathe is off. I then turn on the lathe and wipe it off, applying some pressure. You'll sort of get a feel for the right amount of pressure. I love this part because the color and characteristics of the wood really come to life!\nFinally, the pen is ready for the finish. The type of finish you use will determine how you apply it, but generally, I put a small amount of finish on a rag, and apply it to the wood while the lathe is on. Be careful using rags and sandpaper because the material might try to grab it. In that case, don't try to hold onto the rag/sandpaper. Your lathe is stronger than you!

Joining two boards with, say, 5 dovetails involves 22 separate saw cuts even before you start removing the waste between the pins and tails (that's 88 cuts per drawer - or about 1000 cuts for the 10-drawer chest from which the picture above was taken). With all these cuts needing to be in the right place, at the correct angle and square in the other dimensions, the opportunity for error is great. Unless you have spent a lot of time perfecting your technique, making a set of drawers with dovetailed corners by hand is a daunting task. Not surprising, then, that an array of aids are available to the amateur (and professional) to make the task easier and quicker. These generally involve a router machine, some special router bits and a jig or other method of guiding the cuts. There are a number of disadvantages to these methods, aside from the very significant investment in equipment which may not be used very frequently. Router-cut joints are often said to look obviously \"machine made\" (skinny pins are out); tear-out can occur which ruins the look; and the cheaper jigs cannot cut traditional \"through\" dovetails.\nAn alternative is to use a general-purpose bandsaw to make the saw cuts. A bandsaw is probably the most versatile woodworking machine you can have and is in frequent use in the workshop, unlike those router jigs. However, this approach has hitherto only solved half the problem, and the easy half at that. For example, the method described in Lonnie Bird's (excellent) \"The Bandsaw Book\" cuts the pins using a series of simple spacers and the bandsaw table at an angle. However, the tails then have to be marked out by hand using the pins as a template - a tricky task which is prone to error - and the tails then need to be cut \"freehand\". \"Perfect Dovetails\" resolves this problem by providing a method by which the pins and tails can be cut using the same layout method. As a result, usually the joint will fit \"straight from the saw\" with only minimal cleaning up. So, if you have a bandsaw, no further investment is required to cut dovetails quickly, accurately and consistently. No tear-outs, no gaps and no hassle.\nJust one word of warning - this instructable assumes that you know the basics about cutting dovetails. If not then there are other instructables that cover this - for example \"How to dovetail\".\nAlso, the standard safety warning: The use of any sharp tools, and in particular powered tools, necessarily involves a degree of risk. It is the user's responsibility to implement safe working practices - if you are unfamiliar with these, then acquire appropriate training before proceeding.", "title": "Perfect Dovetails", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Perfect-Dovetails/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "My method, which I call \"Perfect Dovetails\" actually has two alternative methods which use the same underlying calculations:\nThe \"spacer\" method (first picture) is very simple and requires very little investment in components or preparation. You just need some scrap timber. However there is a bit of scope for error so care is required.\nThe \"jig\" method (second picture) does involve making a simple jig first, but after that it is even easier than the spacer method and, with just a little care, is very accurate.\nThis instructable covers the spacer method.\nThe materials required for this are very simple:\nSome scrap hardwood and/or MDF.\nSome coloured masking tape\n...and, of course the wood for your joints\nFor tools, you need:\nA bandsaw that tilts both ways (if yours doesn't tilt, you can make a jig - see Lonnie Bird's book or this website).\nSimple hand tools, e.g. a plane, some sandpaper, a drill\nAn accurate method of measuring - ideally including a vernier gauge\nCutting gauge or wheel gauge (better than an ordinary marking gauge for cross-grain marking)\nChisels (size depends on joint size), files / rasps, coping saw or fret saw (to remove waste)\nRouter and table for lapped dovetails only (optional - otherwise some hand cutting is required)\nIf there is sufficient demand, then I can include details on the jig method at a later date.

The \"perfect dovetails\" method relies on two important things before you start:\nan accurate cut from the bandsaw\naccurately dimensioned boards\nAs regards the bandsaw, any decent quality bandsaw should be up to the task so long as it\nhas a two-way tilting table,\ncan be set with the fence either side and\nhas been properly set up and maintainedand\nhas a good sharp blade in it.\nWith short cuts in fairly thin pieces of timber, such as for dovetails, blade wander is not such a problem as it can be for deeper and longer cuts, but nevertheless you do want to be as accurate as possible and a smooth cut is important, so use a new blade with, say, 4tpi for larger boards or 6tpi for smaller ones.\nAs regards the boards to be joined, when using the spacer method, they must be exactly the same width and each board must be of an even thickness. (The importance of having exactly equal width boards cannot be underestimated. A 0.5mm difference between the board widths will translate to a 0.5mm error in the relative sizes of pins and tails. This is because the spacer method references off both edges of the boards). Fine tune the widths to within 0.2mm of each other by either planing or building up an edge with strips of tape. The edges should all be square and smooth. Don't forget to make the boards fractionally longer than the finished length to allow for trimming the joint after it is complete (a typical trim allowance might be 0.5mm in which case allow an extra 1mm length if the board is jointed at both ends). Also, if you are making multiple joints then make sure that similar boards are exactly the same dimensions as each other. But you would do all that normally anyway, right?\nHaving got the basics right, you now need to know exactly the dimensions of your boards. I advise working in millimeters throughout as they are a useful scale for most dovetail joints and my calculator takes decimal inputs, not fractions, but if you want to work in cubits, feel free. You also need to know the kerf of your bandsaw blade. This is quite critical, so it is worth measuring it accurately as follows:\nMake a board from scrap timber that has smooth and parallel sides and is 4-6\" (100-150mm) wide. Measure this width accurately (to the nearest 0.2mm) using a vernier gauge. (See picture)\nMake 4 or more lengthways cuts - i.e. cutting into 5 or more pieces - as straight and cleanly as possible.\nIf the sawn edges are rough you can clean up them up minimally to remove the worst of the sawn roughness (e.g frayed edges which prevent the pieces fitting back together), but don't go overboard. It is better to use a really good blade which leaves a clean cut.\nNow put the pieces back together and clamp them well, then re-measure the width. The clamping of pieces is to simulate the tightness of fit of the required joint, so no gaps should be apparent.\nSubtract the new width from the old, divide this difference by 4, or however many cuts you made and that is your saw kerf. (See picture)\nFinally, before you start the design tool, label the edges of your boards \"A \" and \"B \" so that they all match. For drawers, I normally label the top edge \"A \".", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPA/4PY5/IOOD64DW/FPA4PY5IOOD64DW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY6/MJZ0/IOOD64EK/FY6MJZ0IOOD64EK.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Before You Start..."}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Now it's time to plan your perfect dovetails and see what they will look like. For this step you need to use the \"perfect Dovetails\" design tool. Put all your measurements into the \"design tool\" calculator form, namely:\nThe saw kerf you calculated earlier\nThe width of your two boards (which should be the same)\nThe thickness of each board (which may be different)\nYou need to decide how many tails you want, but you can always change this if you want to. You also need to decide the dovetail angle to use. I recommend using a whole number of degrees (which makes it easier to see on your bandsaw table tilt gauge). 8 degrees is about 1:7 which is a good all-purpose angle. Put these details into the design tool calculator. By the way, it is perfectly possible to use a dovetail angle of zero to make a finger joint, but please note the comments in the \"Tweaks\" section.\nNow design and enter the pin widths. The dimensions in each case are the widths at the base of the pins (the widest part). It makes life easier if you set this to be just a fraction more than the width of one of your chisels, so that chopping out the waste between the tails is simpler (i.e. the width of a chisel plus a saw kerf is good). One nice thing about the \"perfect dovetails \" method is that you can make narrow pins in the traditional style, without being constrained by router shanks. Make them as wide or narrow as you like, you can always change it in the design stage. Of course, they will need to be wide enough to allow the tails to be cut (i.e so that the narrow end of the pins is a bit more than the saw kerf), but the calculator will let you know if you go too narrow.\nYou also have to specify the widths of the half-pins at each edge of the board. These will normally be a bit wider as you don't want them to break off when fitting (they have nothing the other side to support them). You may also need one of the half-pins to accommodate a groove for a drawer bottom. Talking of drawers, you may want to have the back of the drawer a different width from the sides (to accommodate the bottom of the drawer running underneath the back, say, and/or to reduce the top of the back to allow for easy insertion of the drawer). You can do this by specifying a cut-away for the pin board on either or both edges. If you use my convention of the top being side \"A\" and the bottom being side \"B\", then you will, for example, set the \"Cut-away on Edge 'B'\" to be the distance from the bottom of the drawer sides to the top of the groove in them which takes the bottom piece. (Note that either the pin board or the tail board could be cut down after making the joint, but it is usually the pin board that is affected).\nFinally enter the \"trim allowances \".\nThe \"end trim allowance\" (when positive) allows the tails to protrude slightly so that they can be neatly trimmed. If you are making a lapped dovetail joint (see later notes), then enter a negative end trim allowance equal to the amount of the covering thickness required on the pin board.\nThe \"fitting allowance\" allows you to trim the cut sides of the tails and pins slightly without causing gaps, giving a much more accurate finish to the joint. For \"workmanlike\" rather than \"show\" joints, a fitting allowance of zero may be used and the joint should fit straight from the saw. Otherwise, 0.3mm will give an excellent finish without adding too much work (this equates to removing 0.15mm from each side).\nNow click \"submit \" and the calculator will draw your joint for you as well as calculate the spacers that you will need. You may get a number of warning messages if the calculator doesn't quite like your specification. Hopefully these are self explanatory. If it can draw the joint then it will do so and this might help you to understand any error messages and how to fix them.\nDon't forget to put the name of your joint in the box at the top of the calculator.

You will see that there are two columns, labelled \"Edge A to fence \" and \"Edge B to fence \". If the joint is symmetrical (i.e. the half-pins on each edge are the same width) then these columns will be identical, otherwise the last spacer will differ. In either case, there are the same number of spacers as there are tails.\nYou will need to cut spacers of the specified width, ideally from a stable hardwood or MDF. You will also need a jig for making the tails, cut from a similar wood. To cut the jig use the pattern illustrated in the picture - make it about 10\" (250mm) long and with a diagonal section at the angle you have chosen for your tails and the \"notch\" at right angles to this. The dimensions are not critical, but the angle (and the right-angled notch) does need to be accurate.\nTo make the spacers:\nMake them from a similar thickness board as the jig and as long as the cut-out diagonal section of the jig.\nCut them as accurately as you can (a table saw with a fine blade is best, but otherwise finish with a plane and abrasive paper stuck on a flat surface). In particular, ensure that the edges are smooth and parallel. If the widths are very slightly off then this will result only in slightly different sized tails - the joint will fit so long as the spacers are numbered and always used in the same order.\nExcept for the last spacer, fix a \"cap\" to the top of each spacer as shown. It is easiest to fix one cap piece across them all and then cut to separate - see picture.\nWrite the number on each spacer - it is important to use them always in the same order, in case of slight differences in width.\nThe last spacer (or pair of spacers if the edges are different) does not have a cap, but has a notch cut at he same angle as the tails. There are two ways (at least) of doing this.\nMake a small \"filler piece\" (length specified by calculator). Place this in the notch of the jig and place the spacer behind it (see picture), adjusting the fence so that the blade just brushes the corner of the spacer. Now remove the filler piece, move the spacer into the notch of the jig and cut the notch in the spacer.\nOr: Cut the notch in the corner of the spacer in a similar fashion but without using the filler piece. Now drill a 3.5mm hole in the top end of the spacer and insert an M4 bolt (waxed) and screw in until it protrudes by the amount specified for the length of the filler piece (see picture). The advantage of this method is that it allows for small changes to improve the fit and also means that the spacer can be used for other projects (which might require a different sized filler piece). Do make sure that the bolt is close enough to the inside (flat) edge of the spacer to fit behind the cap on the adjacent spacer.\nLabel the end spacer(s). If there are a pair of different spacers label them clearly \"Edge A towards fence\" or \"Edge B towards fence\".\nWrite the width on the bottom ends of all spacers, so that they can be re-used in other projects if required.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F09/CH7G/IOO57YDI/F09CH7GIOO57YDI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5Z/RGK8/IOOD64CW/F5ZRGK8IOOD64CW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPY/G0Z3/IOOD648H/FPYG0Z3IOOD648H.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVE/J92W/IOOD64BW/FVEJ92WIOOD64BW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FO3/DDL0/IOOD64F8/FO3DDL0IOOD64F8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FR1/APCO/IOOD64BT/FR1APCOIOOD64BT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: All About the Spacers"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "If you haven't already done so, label the boards clearly on the face side(outside of the box or drawer).

I find it best to put labels on masking tape as it is clearer and does not mark the wood.\nDouble-check that the boards are exactly the same width and that this is the same width that you have entered into the design tool. Also double-check that the edges are parallel. (Measure twice, cut once!)\nMark the shoulders on each board, using a cutting gauge. For the tail boards, the width of the shoulder must be the thickness of the pin board plus the trim allowance as specified in the calculator. For the pin boards, the trim allowance is up to you.

Place all the spacers against the fence (leave out the angled jig - that's only for cutting the tails). Make sure the spacers are in the right sequence - lowest nearest the fence. They should all fit neatly in place, caps overlapping. The last (end) spacer has no cap and should be placed so that the notch is not next to the blade. If there are two types of end spacer, because the jont is asymmetric, then use the correct one - i.e. \"Edge A against fence\" if the board you are going to cut will have edge A nearest the fence (remember that you will be cutting the pin board with its face - labelled - side uppermost). Now adjust the fence so that the blade just touches the end spacer (a good test is to run the blade in the wrong direction, by hand - if it lifts up the spacer then it is too close). See picture. Remove the end spacer.\nPlace the pin board, face side uppermost, with the correct side nearest the fence, into the notch formed by the cap of the spacer (made available after removing the end spacer). It is a good idea to leave the end spacer, which you just removed, on the bandsaw table to remind you which edge should be nearest the fence. Also, if you made a test joint, you can use this to check that the cut will be in the right place. Now slide the whole assembly forward (see picture), cutting down to just meet the shoulder line (you can use a stop if you wish, but I tend to do it by eye). Remove the outer spacer and repeat for the next cut. Repeat until the last cut is with no spacers.\nNext, move the fence to the right of the blade and tilt the table the other way (clockwise) by your chosen angle (again the fence will be lowest).

If you are making drawers then you may not want the dovetails to show on the face (on the other hand you may be very happy to display your \"Perfect Dovetails\" in true \"Arts and Crafts\" style). In this case there are three alternative options:\nMake an overlay drawer, using a separate overlay board on the front; or\nRebate the edges of the drawer front by at least as much as the thickness of the sides and add a cockbead to give a flush drawer; or\nUse lapped dovetails on the front.\nIf you are determined to use lapped dovetails then:\nPlan the dovetails as usual, but enter a negative trim tolerance in the spreadsheet, equal to the thickness to be left in the front board.\nCut the tails on the bandsaw as per instructions.\nIf you do not have a router with a table, then mark out the pins either:\n(a) in the traditional way, by laying the tail board on the pin board and marking with a knife; or\n(b) using the spacers as if you were making a through dovetail, but only making a very shallow cut to act as a guide for a dovetail saw.If using method (b), do not cut deeper than the trim tolerance you have allowed for the pins. Remember, this can be any amount you want - it does not need to be the same as the tails trim tolerance, which in this case is negative. So you could plan to trim 1mm from each end of a pin board, giving ample to make a clear guiding cut. Also use a dovetail saw (in step 4 below) with a kerf as close as possible to, but no wider than, the bandsaw kerf.\nCut out the waste in the traditional way. Don't forget to mark the top edges of the tails first and do not cut above this line, especially if using method (b) above since the guiding cuts will extend above it.\nCutting lapped dovetails with a router (jig-free!)\nIt is much quicker if you have a router (with the right bit) and table; the best way is:\nUsing a piece of scrap the same width as the real pin board and at least as thick as the tails, cut the pins on the bandsaw as for a \"through\" dovetail joint. The tops of the pins may get cut off, but don't worry (so long as they are as deep as the lapped joint requires). Check the fit - you can clean up a little, but you want it to be tight.\nNow use your scrap piece to set up your router bit and table. Use a moveable fence square to the main fence. Set the main fence to the required length of cut and set the bit to the required depth.\nSet the moveable square fence to the right of the bit (to ensure that the bit rotation acts against the fence rather than away from it) and place your \"test\" piece next to it, adjusting so that the bit just touches the inside of the required pin; clamp it in place using a fence stop to secure against the force of the rotating bit (see picture).\nCheck that the bit does not quite cut the pin on the scrap board, then rout your real pin board. I also suggest you check the depth and length of the cut on your scrap before routing the main piece. I adjust the length of the cut so that it will undercut slightly at the back of the joint but stop fractionally short on the inside fence, leaving a simple clean-up with a chisel.\nRepeat this process, setting the bit against each side of the \"test\" pins, then cutting the real piece.

But it is quicker and easier, and in my opinion yields the best results.\nThe first thing you have to do is measure your phone. I have a case on my phone that made using my ruler slightly less accurate than I like so I elected to use calipers. I measured the width and the height as well as the thickness of my phone, case included.\nNext on the scrap of MDF, I drew a line that was 3/4\" from the bottom edge. Then making sure I had some extra space I drew a vertical line 90\u00b0 to it. I laid my phone on the MDF, lined it up with these marks and traced the rounded corner. Using a ruler, and a bit of guessing, I figured out that the radius was 5/8\", which meant I needed to drill a 1 1/4\" hole to get that sweep. I drilled out that hole at the drill press using an 1 1/4\" forstner bit.\nThen over at the tablesaw i used a crosscut fence to cut my vertical line, stopping just as the blade came through the hole. I then set my fence and cut the horizontal line, stopping it in the same way. I had my blade set to the maximum height for this so that my stopped cuts didn't go further than they needed to.\nThat is the template done.

The jointer is the machine that will give us this.\nFirst, check to see that the fence of the machine is 90\u00b0 to the bed. Next check your lumber to see if it is reasonably flat and stable on the bed of the jointer. Oftentimes, pieces are slightly warped. If this is the case, then select the face that is the most stable. Set the depth of cut to 1/32\" and run the face of your lumber through. If there are areas that are still rough, go ahead and pass it again.\nOnce the face is flat and smooth we need to joint and edge. Turn the lumber on its side and using firm pressure push the freshly jointed face against the fence. Run the piece through. You should now have a flat face and a flat edge and a perfect 90\u00b0 corner. Check to see that it is 90\u00b0 using an engineer's square.\nNext we will go over to the tablesaw and rip the lumber parallel.

This sort of thing is better to do in multiple passes as it is safer and easier on the blade and offers more control.\nStand the piece up on its edge and flat face against the fence. Run the piece through the blade. Flip it end over end and run it through again. Raise the blade another inch and repeat. In the end you want to be left with a half inch or so strip that is still intact. It is at this point that i drew a couple of lines across the end of my piece. I should have done this before, but forgot. These marks will let you know which ends match up together.\nAt the band saw, cut through the remaining half inch, keeping the blade inside the kerf made by the tablesaw blade. You should now have two pieces of wood, one thicker than the other.\nMy thicker piece already had a flat face so I just passed it through the planer to clean up the marks from re-sawing.

Trace your shape with a pencil. Go over to the bandsaw and cut it out leaving an 1/8\" or so extra.\nStick the template to the piece of wood using some double sided tape. Take care to make sure your edges are nicely aligned.\nUsing a pattern bit in your router set the height so that the bearing rides in the cleanest part of the template. Taking light passes, route away the material until it is all gone and the bearing rides unobstructed around the entire pattern. Light passes will help to avoid burning, especially on the end grain.

This step also involves the use of a router, but all you non router people, a good SHARP chisel should do you nicely.\nPlace your phone in the space we just cut out and using a pencil, make a couple of marks where the charging port is. It is ok to go a little bigger.\nMeasure from the bottom edge to each line. We will use these measurements to set our fence. My measurements ended up being 2\" from the bottom and just over 3\" from the bottom. I decided on making a 1-1/8\" wide grove.\nSo first things first: I chucked a 3/4 straight cut bit into my router. I then set my fence (a straight, smooth piece of mdf) so that is was 3 1/8\" to the outside of my bit. I then used a small scrap of 1/2\" mdf as a spacer and double checked that this give me a gap of 2\" between my fence and the inside of my router bit. This setup makes it possible to run the piece twice to get my 1 1/8\" groove without having to move the fence. Next, I butted the piece up against the fence and the bit. On the end I measured out 2 1/2\" and screwed down a stop block. This makes sure I stop the piece accurately each time. Lastly I set the height of the bit to 3/16\". My final height will be 3/8\" but i decided to do it in two passes.\nTurn on the router and run the piece until you hit the stop block. Turn off the router and wait till the bit stops spinning. Remove the spacer and run it again until you hit the stop block. Turn off the router. Once the bit stops spinning raise the height to your final depth of cut. Run the piece again, with and without the spacer. That is the thin piece done.\nPlace your two pieces together and transcribe the lines from the thin piece to the thick one. Using a sliding T- square extend those lines. Then draw one in the exact center between those two lines. I was using an 1 1/4\" forstner bit for the next step so i drew line 5/8\" + 1/4\" from the edge. The 1/4\" is so that the hole is somewhat hidden when it is all together.\nAt the drill press i used those center lines to drill the first hole.

The next step is to glue it all back together. If you are lucky (a darker wood helps), you won't be able to tell that it was ever cut in half to begin with. It's fun when people have to scratch their heads a bit to figure out how you did something.\nIt is at this point that you will want to sand some pieces that will be difficult to reach later. Namely the good edge of your thick piece and the phone edge of your thin piece. I sanded with 120 grit using a machine wherever i could and 150 grit by hand. It was also at this stage that I chose to carve out a little notch to accommodate a button on the side of my phone.\nOnce you are done sanding, place the pieces together and scribe an extremely light line on the thick piece. This will help you know where to spread your glue and won't be seen in the final product.\nNow just lay out your pieces and spread a thin layer of white glue. Stick the pieces together and add as many clamps as you can fit. Make sure not to over-tighten them or you may leave pock marks in your piece. This glue-up can be temperamental. The glue will make the pieces want to slide around. In order to combat this I left my piece extra long. After i had the glue on and everything lined up, I fired two brad nails into the end that I knew was going to be cut off so that the pieces wouldn't slide. I then applied my clamps. If you don't have a brad nailer you can achieve the same thing using a couple of screws. Pre drill and place in the the screws before you add the glue, that will help guide the screws back in place after the glue has been applied.\nUsing a damp rag, or possibly even a toothbrush and water, clean up all of your squeeze out. I usually do not clean up the squeeze out where the phone will sit. Using the damp cloth method runs the risk of pushing glue into the grain of the wood which will show up in finishing if not properly sanded out. I pre-sanded because it is difficult to get sandpaper in there without leaving unwanted crossgrain sanding mark. Instead i chose to let it dry and then cut it out with a good sharp chisel.\nLet it dry for at least an hour, but overnight is best.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVM/OHJG/ION4KSCP/FVMOHJGION4KSCP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOD/RISC/ION4KSDV/FODRISCION4KSDV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPB/JE1D/ION4KSH0/FPBJE1DION4KSH0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX3/OBWG/ION4KSG1/FX3OBWGION4KSG1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Z/KKVC/ION4KSHS/F1ZKKVCION4KSHS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Glue Up"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Once the glue has dried, you can remove the clamps. Generally, try as you might, the pieces will slip a touch out of line. One quick, shallow pass on the bottom edge should get it nice and flat again. You will then want to chisel, scrape or sand any glue residue in the spot where your phone will sit.\nNext we will cut it to final size. Using the measurements of the width and height of your phone give yourself some lines to follow. At the table saw rip your top edge first. Sneak up on the line if you have to by taking a test cut first and then slowly readjusting your fence until it is perfect. Then do the same with the crosscut cut, using a crosscut guide.\nNow we need to decide final size. It can be as long or as short as you like, but you have to make it at least 1/4\" wider than the length of the groove you cut for your charging cable.

One well placed curve can definitely change the tone of the piece for the better and this one is mine.\nIt is really quite simple. I use a roll of masking tape to give myself a guideline on the top edge. Then i cut out the shape on the bandsaw, staying proud of the line. Then using a palm sander, I sanded it until it was smooth and even. I also eased a few of the corners to make it more interesting and to match the style of the phone.\nNext is the grooves. Fair warning, it looks and sounds a bit sketchy but is actually quite easy and safe due to the minimal height of the blade. If, however, you look at my technique and you say \"Luca...you are crazy!\", then DO NOT try it. If you are nervous you could at least ruin your piece and at worst cut yourself. Please refer to the gif for a visualization. Here we go.\nDecide where you want your grooves to start. I decided that i didn't want them running at the bottom at all so i started them 1 1/4 from the bottom. Set you fence to this measurement and the height of your blade to 1/8\". Standing the piece up on end and keeping light pressure to keep the bottom edge against the fence, push the piece until you engage the blade. Begin rolling the piece toward you, following the curve we made until it is flat against the table. push it through to complete your cut. Check your groove. If it is a bit choppy you can run it through again until it is smooth and even all the way around. Once you are happy with it, move your fence a quarter inch to the right (1 1/2\") This leaves a 1/8\" gap and cuts another 1/8\" groove. As long as you keep moving the fence 1/4\" at a time your spacing should be uniform. Cut as many grooves as you like. I chose to do it with a bit of asymmetry again and i only did 5. On my older one i did many more.\nThat's it. That is the retro flair.

We need to make one final cut; a tapered cut on the bottom so that our clock sits slightly back (the retro part would not have been possible with this taper already cut). I will save you some trouble of trial and error and tell you that an 8\u00b0 angle seems to be right in the sweet spot. Tilt the blade on your table saw and run the piece through so that you are tapering the bottom. Again, it is best to do this in a couple of passes so that you can sneak up on the edge and get a good clean cut. If you have been following along so far, making due with a chopsaw or a circular saw, I would suggest doing this part with a hand plane. You should be able to get a nice taper in fewer strokes than you would think.\nOK! Finishing! I sanded my piece using 120 grit on a palm sander to remove any machine marks from the tablesaw or the planer and then 150 grit by hand.\nFor the actual finish you can use anything you like, or have on hand. There are a variety of oils, and clear finishes available to you. I mixed up what i call 333. It is usually known as the Krenov finish or a cabinet maker's finish. I was taught to make it using 3 parts each of the 3 ingredients, hence my name for it. All you need is some oil based varnish, some varsol and some boiled linseed oil. The easiest was to do this, in my opinion, is to get an 8 oz can of varnish and an empty quart can. Open the varnish, stir it up and dump it in the quart can. Next fill the 8 oz can with varsol and add it to the quart can, and lastly do it again with the boiled linseed oil. Stir to combine and you are done. It can be applied with a brush but i like to wipe it on. It offers the beauty and feel of an oiled piece, but the varnish offers some protection as well.\nApply a coat of finish and let it dry (the 333 was pretty quick in the warm weather, about 5 minutes). Using some 320 grit sandpaper scuff and smooth the surface.

As he and his wife prepared to move out of the church parsonage that had been their home for the past thirty years he faced the problem of what to do with the eclectic collection of, well, stuff that had accumulated over the years. Several years before, the church had replaced all the pews during a remodeling of the sanctuary and he had saved the hymnal racks from the backs of the pews, figuring he would come up with some way of using them some day.\nAs the day neared for their departure, he found that he still had stacks of these hymnal racks piled up in his workshop. Since he knew I'm a bit of an amateur woodworker he asked if I'd be interested in them. Silly question! They were nicely finished oak (I think) and while a bit dusty, the finish was still in wonderful condition (Figure 1). So we made the transition from his workshop to mine.\nThe racks now sat in my basement shop, growing more dust. But they looked so nice and I really thought there should be something I could do with them. Now, while my motto has long been that one can never have too many friends, flashlights or clamps, my wife agrees with the friends part, but insists that the other two items should be shoes and plant stands (actually, her list is quite a bit longer than that). And one day, while examining my stash of hymnal racks, I realized that two of them joined together would make a nice looking wooden column, which would make a nice looking - wait for it - plant stand! Not only did I find a use for all those racks, but it would be a use that would make my wife happy...and is there any greater accomplishment than putting your rather modest skills to work and - in so doing - producing something that pleases your spouse? I didn't think so either. Off to the workshop.\nNow I realize that very few people have stacks of hymnal racks sitting in their workshop, and I almost didn't enter this project in the Reclaimed Wood contest because as I looked the entries over, a vast majority are made from salvaged pallet wood, barn wood or raw wood pieces - in other words, basically free wood used to make something worthwhile. This is a great idea, but my project is quite a bit different in that this was wood that was very nice in the first place but no longer able to serve its original purpose. I didn't want to sand it all down and start from scratch - I wanted to preserve not only the wood, but the finish and lines as well. And since it's a very specific modification of one thing into something completely different, I wasn't sure how well it would fit the contest. But then it came to me that the idea isn't limited to hymnal-racks-to-plant-stands, but could be adapted to projects using all sorts of architectural woodwork: window frames and sills, door frames, baseboards, cove molding - pretty much any nicely formed and finished wood no longer serving its original purpose. So I figured this is every bit as much a project about reclaiming as one that turns pallet wood into something.

Now that I had actually thought of something I could make with the racks, I wanted to stretch their usefulness as far as possible, so I opted to make the fourth column side from plywood, saving the additional racks to become the basis of even more plant stands. It would have been great if I had some salvaged baseboard in a similar finish, because I could have miter cut four pieces of baseboard at 45 degrees and joined them together to make the top and base of the columns. But I didn't have that, so I used some leftovers from previous projects to make the top and base, routing the edges into a nice pattern.\nThe first plant stand I made was a tall one - as tall as I could make it without a horizontal joint somewhere in the column.

I routed a 45 degree angle around the smaller squares and a Roman ogee around the larger ones.\nIt was time to match finishes, so I experimented with various stains and discovered that an Early American stain matched the finish on the racks nicely. I stained the pieces for the top and bottom and the piece of eighth inch plywood that would make the fourth side of the column before going any further. Staining now would allow me to get all edges and corners cleanly stained before I assembled the pieces, and since I wasn't planning on using any nails or screws on exterior areas, it wouldn't pose a problem with filling, sanding and staining holes later on.\nThe hymnal racks happened to have card holders at each end, which gave me good surface area to work with at both ends of the column when I made one out of two racks. But since the smaller column is made with only one rack cut in half, the wood from the card holders is joined together at just one end of the column (Figure 5). This meant I needed to glue a 4 inch square flush with the opposite end of the column to have something I could secure the top to. I also cut another 4 inch square to glue into the column interior about a third of the way up from the bottom (Figure 6). I screwed the 6 1/4 inch squares with the bevel to the top and bottom of the column (Figure 7) and then glued 7 1/4 inch squares to the 6 1/4 inch squares, hiding the screws and producing a bit more elaborate edging for the top and base.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FNU/8ZMC/IOOJWV2T/FNU8ZMCIOOJWV2T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUT/1EHN/IOOJWV5A/FUT1EHNIOOJWV5A.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA2/DG2C/IOOJWV5F/FA2DG2CIOOJWV5F.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9V/8S60/IOOJWV7V/F9V8S60IOOJWV7V.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Making the Base and Top"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The taller a plant stand is, the more it needs to be weighted at the bottom in order to keep it from easily being knocked over. I can't stress the importance of this step enough - the bottom needs to be weighted or you will one day very much regret it. To do this, I glued a stopper block about a third of the way up from the bottom of the column, then filled the lower part of the column with gravel (Figure 8). This gives the column a much lower center of gravity and greatly reduces the possibility of accidentally knocking it over. With the shorter stand, I also placed the end with the card holders at the base end of the column so that the bulk of the wood - as well as the gravel - would be at the lower end of the column.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FV5/9CM1/IOOJWV7Z/FV59CM1IOOJWV7Z.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: A Question of Balance"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "When joined together, the two pieces of hymnal rack produced a column with a 4\" x 4\" interior dimension.

This was great on the card holder end, because it meant I could use a 1/8\" piece of plywood to make the fourth side of the column. But I needed places at the top and middle of the column to glue the plywood in place. For that reason, both of the 4 x 4 inch pieces I had cut for the top anchoring block and the middle divider actually became 4\" x 3 7/8\" pieces so they would recess 1/8 of an inch on the fourth side, allowing both room to insert the plywood panel and places to which I could glue the panel. With the gravel in place and the plywood piece already stained, I was now able to glue the plywood for the fourth side at the top, center and bottom of the column (Figure 9).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F90/T8RV/IOOJX7UU/F90T8RVIOOJX7UU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: The Fourth Side"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "I used a couple of coats of 3X semi-gloss polycrylic finish on the fourth side and the top and bottom, adding a single coat on the already finished sides to refresh the finish a bit, and the plant stand was complete (Figure 10).\nEven if you don't have stuff hanging around your workshop to recycle, I hope I've brought up a few ideas you may be able to use if you stumble across some architectural wood that is nice enough to deserve a second chance at life...or just want to make a nice plant stand..

Talk about bang for your buck!\nAs soon as we figure this out, we at the Instructables Design Studio went right to work making the Napparatus.", "title": "The Napparatus", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Napparatus/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "IDEA\nThe first step, of course, is always design. The big idea was to make a place for taking naps that wouldn't sacrifice priceless floor space in the building. The obvious answer to that was to make the \"bed\" on a raised platform so that you could still walk under it. The space already had a couch and a coffee table, so the structure would need to accommodate those.\nA solid platform wouldn't do because of a fire sprinkler above that space- never obstruct a fire sprinkler! This is where the idea of a cargo net came from- water will have no trouble getting through a net with 2\" \u00d8 openings.\nSCHEMATIC DESIGN\nFor the structure, we decided to go with aluminum box section with aluminum gussets. This makes it lightweight; a grand total of 289 LB for the entire structure. Being in a seismic zone, it's a bad idea to add significant weight to any building that wasn't factored in when the building was designed.\nWe went with 3\"X3\"X.125\" and 1/4\" plate for the gussets, which is serious overkill! You could put a tank on top of this thing and it wouldn't budge. We had a few reasons for this:\nWe didn't want the facilities personnel to worry about it not being string enough.\nThe net is hung from the beams on the top of the structure, meaning they need depth in the horizontal direction to keep them from bending when the net is pulled tight from weight.\nWe sacrificed the efficiency of designing the structure with multiple types of members so that we could get a consistent aesthetic and simplify the kit of parts.\nAny time you're designing something specific to a space, you've got to measure the space it's going in before you do anything else. The space for it had a 7'-3\" X 11' footprint, so we went with a 7' X 10' footprint to prevent the structure from touching the walls. We made the structure 7'-2 1/2\" tall to give us ample clearance to walk underneath.\nFor the full kit of parts, see page 3 of the PDF in this step.\nPARTS LIST\n*Quantities are based on package sizes and aren't necessarily accurate.

Very beefy!\nFRAMING\nWith the eye-bolts installed, we started assembling the frame. We did this in the standard construction way- frame up a wall on the floor, tilt it up, connect it to the next wall, repeat... We used 1/2\"\u00d8 galvanized steel hex nuts, nylon washers, and nylon cored locknuts to attach the gussets to the tubes. We got an off-the-shelf ladder from McMaster Carr that we could remove if need be.\nLACING\nWith the structure finished, we started lacing up the cargo net. We did this by zip-tying the net into place from a few of the eye-bolts, then lacing the safety rope through the outer ring of holes on the cargo net. We used a trucker's hitch not to tie the ends of the safety rope together. This is kind of like tuning a guitar- you tighten, then let it stretch, then tighten it again until it's settled.\nWe also ended up adding an extra level of redundancy. We got some paracord and tied back the inner loops of the net to the eye-bolts. That way, if somehow the knot came undone, the net wouldn't fall because it would be held back by the climbing ropes.

This procedure has many benefits! If interested, I suggest you check out the links in this step.\n\u201cShou Sugi Ban \u713c\u6749\u677f (or Yakisugi) is an ancient Japanese exterior siding technique that preserves wood by charring it. Traditionally, Sugi (cryptomeria japonica L.f., also called Japanese cedar) was used. The process involves charring the wood, cooling it, cleaning it, and finishing it with a natural oil. It is an environmentally friendly way to preserve the timber and (paradoxically) make it fire resistant.

I drilled holes in one board using the drill bit with depth stop and marked the hole locations on the other board with the center bits. The key is to use flat work surface so that holes in mating piece would align up correctly.\nCheck out this article on how to do Dowel joinery. Many different methods are presented there.

The 6 pieces of 10\" long 2\" angle are welded to the frame of the new flat bed and to the frame of the truck. If you plan to do this on your truck make sure you check the distance between the rubber stop that keeps your rear axle from hitting the frame. You want the clearance from the bottom of the new flat bed to be greater than the distance between the stop and the axle. This will help ensure your tires won't ever rub on the new flat bed.\n\nAfter all the tack welding is completed clean the slag from the welds and then methodically go through and weld each joint with a finish weld. Make sure to do this symmetrically so that the heat does not warp the metal of the new frame.\n\n* side note: Warping will happen when you heat metal the middle it does not have anywhere to expand but when it cools it cools uniformly and contracts pulling and warping the metal towards the weld. You can actually use this to your advantage with a torch and heat bend big metal just by carefully heating specific areas and allowing them to cool creating a curve. you can also help avoid this by minimizing the welds spacing them out evenly and welding on both sides of the stock being welded. There are many resources online for this if you have problems with your welds.\n\nI used C channel and the leftover angle iron to build a frame to protect the cab. 6ft piece of C channel and four 14\" pieces of 2\" angle.\n\nAfter you have completed the welds clean off all of the slag and spatter with a grinder or wire wheel.

You'll hear the words \"end grain butcher blocks\" thrown a lot around the internet, and this is why:\nWhen you use the end grain of a piece of wood (the fibers are at the surface of the board), it allows the wood to open up and accept the knife better. You wouldn't think this would be good, however it lets the wood form back together and heal. This is also better for you knife! This is a more time-consuming process, involving cutting the board into small strips and gluing them side to side to reveal the end grain on the top and bottom.\nWhen you use the edge grain of a piece of wood (the fibers run along the surface of the board), it means that you are actually cutting the wood, and it isn't able to heal as well because the grain has been severed. This also means that not only are you cutting the food, you are also cutting the board. These boards don't last as long, but are much faster to make and usually are more cost efficient.\nBecause I am making a small cheeseboard with minimal cutting in mind, I decided to go with the edge grain cutting board. This way I can also show off the beautiful grain of the Walnut.\nWhen you are choosing the type of wood that you want to make your cutting board out of, I would first suggest reading this page!\nhttp://www.cuttingboard.com/blog/why-some-woods-ar...\nThe author nicely outlines the best types of wood to use in a cutting board, but I will summarize the main things you need to keep in mind\nHardness\nTightness of grain\nToxicity/allergies\nKeeping these three things in mind, select your wood! I first looked for scrap wood that I could get for free or cheap, and happened upon a great piece of walnut! I then went about finding the wood that I wanted to be the monogrammed letter. I knew that I wanted something dark that would show up well, and looked a lot of places to find the right wood. I ended up going to a nearby lumber store where they had a wide variety of exotic woods. I talked to one of the workers there and they directed me towards wenge, a very dark and hard wood with a distinct grain. Also, because I only needed a very small piece, they let me have it for free!\nNow that I had my wood, I began the design process.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FL8/ZM9V/IN35RPAK/FL8ZM9VIN35RPAK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8A/ZGE6/IN35RSPD/F8AZGE6IN35RSPD.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Choosing Your Wood"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "I started out this project by first designing it in a modeling software.\nThis may seem like overkill, but I knew that I was going to be using a CNC machine so I had to really plan everything out beforehand.\nI drew everything up using Autodesk Fusion 360 (it's free!). Here's a step by step in case you are going to be using a CNC as well (or if you want more modeling practice!)\nMake a rectangle the size that you want your block to be.

Always remember that safety is very important when you in a shop using any sort of tools, so wear your safety glasses, tie up your hair, and wear ear protection if you are working with noisy machines. If you don't know how to use a tool please ask somebody. Now that you're all suited up, carefully cut the piece for your board to the same specs that you set in the previous step. I made sure that my ends were as square as possible.\nI gave the edges a quick sand so that handling would be nicer, and clamped the board onto the bed of the mill. I zeroed out the X, Y, and Z axes, inserted a 1/8\" end mill, and started it up! I used a depth of 1/8\", but you can make this whatever the height of your inlay wood is. Keep in mind that these two measurements should not be exactly the same, and there should be some wood coming out of the surface. You will be sanding this down. I'm not going to go into too many specifics about the setup process, because every mill will be different. Be sure to clear away the wood chips periodically so that you get a really clean cut.\nIf you don't have a mill to spare, the next best step would be to use a routing tool! Print out the design you made in the previous step, and gently trace it out onto the wood. Use a routing attachment to keep your cuts at an even height, and carefully route out the pattern 1/8\" deep. Be sure to clamp down the wood when you do this! Honestly nothing is scarier than having the wood catch on the milling bit and start spinning around like crazy. Go slowly, and listen to the wood to let you know if you are going too fast or slow. Same as above, clear away your wood chips every now and then and wear eye and ear protection!\nNext, prepare the wood for the inlay. Use the same process as above to clamp it into the CNC mill and mill the outline. Since I got my wood for free at a lumber yard, it wasn't as thin as I needed. I ended up using a handsaw to saw it in half so that it was half the thickness (I would not recommend this unless you enjoy having very tired arms), and then milled the top of the piece until it was flat. It should be a little bit thicker than whatever depth you milled out your main board so that it sticks up a little bit.\nPut this wood in the mill and use the pattern to mill away the outline of the design! Alternatively, trace the design on the wood and outline it with your routing tool. I stopped a bit early and used a saw to cut the wood away so that it wouldn't be damaged by the mill if it fell away early.\nAt this point, you are done routing!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FRI/OPJY/IN35O77E/FRIOPJYIN35O77E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8N/9OT8/IN35O7EN/F8N9OT8IN35O7EN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJL/HCWO/IN35O7GJ/FJLHCWOIN35O7GJ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPB/QPWE/IN35O7GX/FPBQPWEIN35O7GX.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Start Your Board"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Once you have both the board and the inlay ready it is tempting to try and force the inlay into the routed board. If it doesn't fit right away, identify which sides are catching, and carefully sand it down and re-try. This takes many, many iterations. A good trick is to save any sawdust from the inlay so that if you sand down too much, you can mix the dust with wood glue to fill any holes.\nUnfortunately I didn't listen to my own advice and tried to force the inlay into place, and realized after that one of the sides wasn't going to fit. Upon trying to gently pry out the inlay it snapped and part of the design was stuck in the wood. Oops! I was much more careful after this, and took my time sanding to make sure the fit was good before applying a layer of wood glue to the inside of the design and inserting the inlay.\nApply even pressure on top of the inlay until the wood glue is dry (generally a couple of hours, but it can sometimes take a full day to cure).\nUsing a palm sander, I then sanded the inlay flush with the surface of the cutting board. I then clamped the board down to a table and sanded down all of the edges until they were nicely rounded. Whenever I am sanding I make sure to take my time. It is extremely easy to take off too much and not realize it until much later. So pause a lot, and just feel the work that you are doing.

They utilize a bubble shaped top so you will need to get creative when designing a caddy for this brand.\nCheck out other designs and options online\nThe good news is you can find a wealth of different ideas and designs online. If this instructable doesn't fit the bill or won't work with your shop vac, that's the place to go.\nNote: The Oneida dust deputy can be bolted to the side of any shop vac with hardware that is included with the unit. This is perhaps the easiest option but one that just didn't meet my needs.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVS/XSTP/IOK9MOWV/FVSXSTPIOK9MOWV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJ2/K75W/IOK9MOYZ/FJ2K75WIOK9MOYZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Who Can Use This Caddy?"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "There are only two main steps to building this caddy:\n1) Build a box to hold the dust collector and\n2) Mount the box to a shell that rests on top of the vacuum\nMaterials:\nI used 3/4\" MDF for the shell and 1/2\" MDF for the box, however wood is always a fine choice as well.\nBuilding the Box\nIf you are using an Oneida dust deputy it's important to note that the bucket is tapered - smaller at the bottom than at the top. For this reason you want the bottom of the box to be slightly larger than the bottom of the bucket. With a properly sized box the sides only need to be about three inches high to provide a good fit and hold the bucket securely. The above photos illustrate the process.\nMaking the Shell\nThe shell sits on the top of the vacuum and is nothing more than two long support legs, one on each side of the motor housing. The legs are held together by small front and rear braces, with the majority of rigidity and strength gained when nailing (or screwing) the box to the shell.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTS/VSEQ/IOH8NSPP/FTSVSEQIOH8NSPP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F16/B066/IOH8NSPM/F16B066IOH8NSPM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNB/NENY/IOH8NSPL/FNBNENYIOH8NSPL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1H/41X1/IOH8NSPK/F1H41X1IOH8NSPK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSS/FRGS/IOH8NSPI/FSSFRGSIOH8NSPI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ2/DJI3/IOIQMMZP/FQ2DJI3IOIQMMZP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Build This Caddy in Two Simple Steps"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "As previously mentioned, the top of a Ridgid shop vac, while flat, slopes at a downward angle from the back to the front. Since we need the caddy to be level when sitting on the vacuum this requires cutting the legs with a taper that matches the slope of the vacuum's top.\nPhotos #2 & #3 show how I calculated the slope of the legs (FYI - make sure the vacuum is on a level surface). In my case I determined that the front dimension of each leg should by approximately 1 1/8\" greater than the rear dimension. However, after cutting the leg it wasn't quite level when placed in position on the vacuum. For this reason I would recommend cutting a few test pieces from scrap lumber to verify you get things right before using your good material. I fixed the legs by cutting shims and gluing them to the legs (still not perfect but acceptable).\nAnyone who knows how to more accurately calculate an angle such as this please share your knowledge via the comments!\nPhotos #3, #4 and #5\nPhoto #3 shows how to mark out the leg on your board. Next, place the angle line of the leg along the edge of a guide board and tack the leg to the guide board (photo #4).

It is rare for a client to give me a piece of timber with a request involving nothing more than can I please make something from it. Usually a designer is given a brief by a client and that brief will involve things like budget, materials preference, functional constraints, stylistic preferences and even environmental concerns. Now that I look back on the process I can see that all those elements were there when Australian Wood Review presented me with the challenge to make a piece from a board of wenge.\nFor a start I do have a client in the form of Australian Wood Review and ultimately its readers. But there is the other client lurking in the background; the perceived customer who will one day buy this product. There is a budget and it is not only the materials budget in the form of the carefully wrapped board that arrived via post. Included in the budget is the time I spend on design and fabrication which has to be considered in regards to the perceived customer. The materials preference, well that is a firm given in this case. When it comes to the functional constraints I did have more freedom that usual, but the dimensions of the board ruled out a few options such as chair, table or sideboard and the like. Stylistic preferences are usually taken care of by the fact that the customer usually approaches me because they like my work. If a client approaches me then I can be fairly sure they want something contemporary. The environmental concerns are becoming more and more part of the designer\u2019s responsibility. If a client isn\u2019t aware of environmental issues associated with timber products then it is probably up to the designer to do a little subtle education.\nFor more how to guides and reviews, check out www.woodreview.com.au or Wood Review TV.", "title": "How to Make a Box", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Box/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "When the parcel of wenge arrived it occurred to me that I should check out the ethical issues surrounding this African timber. A quick Google search provided a few interesting facts. Wikipedia says that \u2018The tree is native to Congo, Cameroon, Gabon, Tanzania and Mozambique\u2019. Under health hazards the same article says, \u2018The dust given off when cutting or sanding wenge can cause dermatitis similar to the effects of poison ivy and is an irritant to the eyes. The dust can cause respiratory problems and drowsiness. Splinters are septic...\u2019.\nThis from the Woodworkers Source website: \u2018Environmental Profile: This species is reported to be rather secure with very little threat to its existence within most of its growth range, including Congo, but it is officially classified as either Extinct, Endangered, Vulnerable, or Rare in Cameroon\u2026(Source\u2014World Conservation Monitoring Center, 1992)\u2019. That gave me the confidence to go into this project feeling a little better about the sustainability of this timber\u2026as long as the board didn\u2019t come from Cameroon!\nConservationist Jane Goodall\u2019s website has references to wenge being harvested in the Tumba Lake region of the Congo with no forest management plan. The Forest Stewardship Council of the UK does list suppliers who source FSS approved wenge. More recently things in the Congo seem to be changing as evidenced by this from the FSS website: \u2018June 2006 A forest concession...covering 296,000 hectares of natural forest has achieved FSC Forest Management certification, the first in the country and only the second in tropical Africa\u2019.\nSo it seems that there isn\u2019t an overall threat to wenge, but it matters who is doing the harvesting. Some sources will harvest with a management plan, others don\u2019t. As a designer/maker then it is important to refer to some sort of Forest Stewardship accreditation.\nOne of my sources for general information on timbers is the excellent World Woods in Colour by William A. Lincoln. In there you can read about some delightful names for wenge. In Zaire alone it is known variously as dikela, mibotu, bokange and tshikalakala. In Gabon it is known as nson-so. Wenge is described as a dense timber with a weight of 880 kg/m3. Because of its resistance to abrasion the timber has been used for flooring. For me the most useful information was that resin cells in the wood might interfere with gluing and polishing. This made me aware that I had better be careful in my choice of adhesive for this project.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Research"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "During the design phase I started with sketching and generated about 40 pencil drawings of various ideas and details. Early on I made the decision to make a box or rather two boxes. With a timber of exotic nature such as wenge it seemed best to make as much use as possible of the resource. One box from the 950 x 160 x 45mm rough sawn wenge seemed excessive. Designing to fit two boxes then became my priority. And a box with a \u2018twist\u2019 seemed to be the best way to add even more value to the resource. The chocolaty colouring of wenge gave me the idea to choose a design that recalled fancy chocolate boxes. Once I was happy with the sketches it was time to test the design prior to fabrication. I have the luxury of having a 16 year old son who is quite proficient with a computer graphics program called 3D Studio Max. With this program it\u2019s easy for Jackson to create a life-like 3D image to help me decide if my design ideas have the impact in three dimensions that I imagine they have. We scanned in my 2D pencil drawings and an image of the dressed wenge board and used that to render the image Jackson created.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FPH/A81Q/IOKBU53F/FPHA81QIOKBU53F.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Design Phase"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "In the workshop the first task was to deep cut the 45mm thick board into three 13mm boards (photo 1).\nA sharp 25mm blade on a large bandsaw that I have access to made this operation easy and quick. When I did this I made sure to have at least one buzzed face on each board as it came off the bandsaw. This and the good luck that the stable wenge came off the saw without distorting meant that I only had to plane 1mm off the boards to achieve their finished 13mm dimension.\nTo get a 220mm width on the boxes I had to join the 13mm boards. This led me to the next step which takes me back to what I consider to be part of careful design. The top of the box is the first thing to be seen and so this should be as pleasing to the eye as possible. I laid the three boards out in various arrangements to ascertain what would look best. In the end I decided on two different patterns: one box has a book matched join while the other has a reverse slip matched arrangement (photos 2 & 3).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSW/M4H8/IOKBU542/FSWM4H8IOKBU542.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGK/4T3V/IOKBU5EH/FGK4T3VIOKBU5EH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FG3/YX6O/IOKBU545/FG3YX6OIOKBU545.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Fabrication"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "I thought that a bookmatch of the more figured grain would be too overpowering and not at all balanced.

Care at the cutting stage made sure that the centre join of the top board was exactly in the middle to maintain visual balance. The three joins between the top, sides and back are all mitred. There is a lot of surface area on these joins and with the small dimension of the boxes I decided this was enough for solid construction. It also means the edges are the only visible lines on the box, which was important to my original design idea.\nNext I quickly sharpened my 45\u00b0 router bit with a 360 grit diamond stone. The wenge is indeed hard and a sharp edge on the tool was needed to make routing of the mitres easy, clean and accurate. Two finger boards on my router table fence kept the material flat and secure and prevented my fingers from doing too much stressful work close to a fast moving cutter (photo 7).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F4H/NNXL/IOKBU5AJ/F4HNNXLIOKBU5AJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: The Cutting Stage"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Before gluing the top assembly with epoxy I cut the housing for the brass butt hinges in the top and back rails of the box. With the positioning of the hinge being low at the back it seemed best to cut these housings while I still had easy access to the edge of the back rail. I have a system for routing hinge housings when I have more than a couple to do that is neat, accurate and quick. With this system I first mark the position of the hinges with a sharp knife and then cut the sides carefully with a Japanese dozuki saw. With a small trim router set to the depth of the hinge leaf and a fence set to the width of the leaf I then quickly remove material to an accurate depth. A few quick cuts with a sharp chisel to clean up the corners is all that is required after the router removes most of the waste.\nBefore I glued the box lid there was one last item: cut the angled sides on the box top that give this box design its unique look. My first idea was to make a jig to hold the sides for cutting on the tablesaw. Then I remembered my straight line pattern fence which would be perfect for this job. The jig is an attachment for the tablesaw fence with a smooth edge for a pattern to run off and a recess for the waste and offcuts to run under. A pattern or in this case, simply a straight edge is tacked on to the piece to be cut. With the fence and blade set to the right height the saw will cut a line deep enough to remove the waste but not cut into your pattern or the jig. I use this jig for many things from truing up a waney edged board to trimming the waste off of solid timber edging to cutting odd angled shapes without setting up mitre gauges or angled cross-cut fences.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FFS/VF8Y/IOKBU5AL/FFSVF8YIOKBU5AL.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Gluing Together"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "With a good fitting mitre joint, tape is all you need to get enough clamping pressure for gluing.

But if your mitres are clean and 45\u00b0 this is not difficult.\nThe hard part of the box was now completed. The elements for the base of the box were cut to size and mitred on my docking saw. Before gluing the base together the trenches for the 6mm back wall and partitions within the box were routed with a 2.5mm bit and the inside faces sanded to 600 grit (photo 2).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FHK/QVUJ/IOKBU5DS/FHKQVUJIOKBU5DS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPX/EMQD/IOKBU5DY/FPXEMQDIOKBU5DY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Clamping With Tape"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Next, epoxy was applied to the mitre joints on the base and they were taped together.

The base was cut from brushbox veneered ply because brushbox ebonises nicely and would blend well with the wenge. The top of the base insert is felted using thinned down PVA to bond the felt to the plywood.\nOnce the box was assembled and everything was working right it could be disassembled and then oiled. The feet and pull were cut and polished from stainless steel bar and attached with small screws. To give a final touch to a small detail, I cleaned up the brass butt hinges with 240 then 400 grit wet and dry before polishing with brasso.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FE8/53JW/IOKBU5E9/FE853JWIOKBU5E9.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 9: Assembly"}, {"step": 10, "steps_text": "After assembling the finished box I decided that the front aspect was in need of something extra. The front edge of the box lid protrudes from the base and could serve as a ledge to facilitate opening of the box. To give the front of the box more visual effect I cut and shaped a small stainless steel pull that protrudes from the middle of the front edge of the lid. The lower front edge of the lid is then routed to form a housing for the pull detail. This detail forms the third point of a triangle of silver highlights which is a good counterpoint to the dark wenge.\nThe finished boxes have the look and feel that I was hoping for during the design stage. Its small size, dark rich colouring and silver highlights all intimate that the box contains precious objects. The heavy weight of the wenge and stainless steel give the piece a feeling of intrinsic value. The chocolate box attitude presented some interesting challenges that made fabricating a rewarding experience.\nLeo Sadlek is a furniture designer/maker who teaches furniture design at School of Design (TAFE) RMIT, Melbourne.

I was interested in buying the table, but upon close inspection (and as you can clearly see in the photo above - bottom right) the table on display was warped and there were quite a lot of cracks already starting to appear in the wood. Give it a few more months and the entire table would need to be refinished - not quite worth the asking price.\nClick here to materials, supplies and tools required.\nI enlisted the help of a friend who does welding to make the steel leg frames for the table, and these only cost R800 (us$50) for the pair. The wood for the table cost R1100 (US$ 70) at my local Builders Warehouse, and that includes the fact that I used a 32mm thick pine rather than go for a thinner 20/22mm pine. So, at the end of the day my much stronger and sturdier table came in at a cost of around R2000 (US$127).", "title": "Make Your Own Dining Table", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Your-Own-Dining-Table/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Preparation\nTrim a 3mm edge at both ends of each plank to remove the protective sealer and give you a nice, smooth edge. Also check that all the planks are exactly the same length, or trim as required.\n1. To join the individual planks together I will be using biscuit joints. If you don't have a Biscuit Joiner you can use a Kreg Pocket hole Jig, or simply glue the planks together. All these methods use wood glue between the planks and are clamped overnight. Place the planks with their face down on a flat work surface.\n2. When cutting the slots, or using a pocket hole jig, it is important to make sure the planks are absolutely flat. To do this I placed a clamp at every position where slots will be cut. If you don't do this, you run the risk of having the planks at differing heights across the width of the table.\n3. I cut four slots along the total length of each plank. After cutting, the planks were placed with the slots facing up, wood glue poured into the slots and the biscuits inserted. These were then left to settle for a couple of hours.\nGOOD TO KNOW: This method allowed me to clean away any glue that oozed out and also let the biscuits absorb and swell to lock in place before joining to the other side. Since I am using a particleboard work surface, I don't want the glued planks to stick to the work top as well.\n4. After leaving for an hour or two, glue was poured into the opposing slots and all the planks slotted together. You may need a rubber mallet on hand when joining the planks together to give them a bit of help. I clamped the entire table with my Bessey clamps overnight. If you don't have monsters like these in your workshop, place something heavy on either side hold everything together while the glue dries.\n5. The crossbeams were glued and screwed into each individual plank using 4,5 x 50mm screws. This not only reinforces the table, but it is where the steel leg frames will be mounted.\n6. To finish off the edges around the table I used my Dremel Trio and a 'V' cutting bit to chamfer the edge at a 45-degree angle.\n7. The entire table was then sanded, first with 120-grit to ensure an even finish and then with 240-grit to make it nice and smooth.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FB7/UVY3/IOIQOJC8/FB7UVY3IOIQOJC8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRH/6P04/IOIQOJD8/FRH6P04IOIQOJD8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAW/JO34/IOIQOJDA/FAWJO34IOIQOJDA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLF/HAYS/IOIQOJEA/FLFHAYSIOIQOJEA.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Make the Table"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Finishing\nI'm not a big fan of pine purely because I don't like the yellow colour. Then I came up with the idea to give the table a very light whitewash finish to diminish the naturally yellow colour. Note: If you want a darker finish, apply Woodoc Gel Stain in your choice of wood tint and then apply a Woodoc Interior Sealer.\nI used matt white and poured this into a container, slowly adding water and testing this on scrap blocks of wood until I achieved the level of whiteness necessary to take away the yellow. See the blocks above: Bottom block is raw pine - Top block is too white - I went with the middle block. Some whitewashing methods require that you use a wire brush over the surface to raise the grain before applying the paint. Pine, however, is a softwood and the paint is easily and quickly absorbed into the surface.\nI used a sponge to apply and had a second (dry) sponge on hand to wipe away excess as quickly as possible. Working from one end to the other - one plank at a time - dip the sponge into the paint and squeeze out excess before wiping along the length as quickly as possible.\nGOOD TO KNOW: Continuously stir the watered-down paint as you work.\nTo ensure the table is protected, I applied 3 coats of Polywax sealer. I don't want a gloss finish on the table and the matt is more natural once dry. Follow the instructions on the can for proper application. You can see that the sealer has not yellowed once applied and will ensure the table is adequately protected. Periodic application, say every 18 to 24 months is necessary.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FOA/9L3N/IOIQOK4O/FOA9L3NIOIQOK4O.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPZ/TK58/IOIQOK4Z/FPZTK58IOIQOK4Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4A/TKN7/IOIQOK6E/F4ATKN7IOIQOK6E.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FL2/5K2W/IOIQOK6U/FL25K2WIOIQOK6U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FHJ/TBNE/IOIQOK7C/FHJTBNEIOIQOK7C.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Finishing the Tabletop"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The steel leg frames are 700mm high and 940mm wide, excluding the lip at each end.

I will also give alternative materials for cheaper choices in building. Buy wood at local wood mills, other stores will not have the wood needed. Keep plies 1/2 inch and under, thinner the ply the more flex the board can have. Different woods that can be used are Maple and Bamboo, finding these in the correct sizes is rare and they are much more costly than Baltic Birch.

Make sure that the image is to the size you want it.\nPlanning concave:\nThis step will be further explained in pressing, but the concept is how you want your board to bend and in what directions, it can be symmetrical, flat, or have a unique design to yourself.

Keep in mind: Baltic Birch is flexible one way, while another it is fairly stiff. Using 4 plies gives a good board for cruising and carving, while 5 plies will be stiff and have a better concave. More than 5 plies is not recommended.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1W/V2EO/IOHGWTU2/F1WV2EOIOHGWTU2.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Cut Out Ply"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Gluing:\nNow that you have your plies cut, gluing can start. Spread glue evenly throughout the first ply and spread out to layer entire surface. A roller or piece of cardboard can be used for this step. Cover each ply with glue and stack them onto one another while lining up with the sides. Each ply should have glue on each side before applying to another ply. Do not cover the top and bottom plies with glue.\nPressing:\nTo create a press, find a piece of wood that is longer and wider than your sheets, finding scrap pieces of wood that can be cut down to desired lengths. These pieces of wood will act as a male end to the press as the plies are pressed on these pieces of wood, it gives your board concave.\nIt is up to you on how your pieces of wood are laid out for the concave. Most commonly, there are typically a piece of wood on each side, length and width wise. Making sure the press is symmetrical with how the wood is laid out onto the board. The scrap wood can be secured to the base by nailing the pieces in. Also, find strong pieces of wood to rest on top of the plies, this is where the top of the C-clamps are placed when pressing.\nAfter the press has been completed. Immediately after Gluing lay the plies onto the press and begin to apply pressure with C-clamps. Try to keep the pressure even throughout the board by using the same size/style clamp on each end. Use a friend for this step, helps keep the pressure exact. The plies will begin to bend to the layout that you have created in the press. If you hear cracking: Stop and loosen up the clamp to avoid ruining the plies. Check to see where the cracking came from (On my press, cracking was heard, but after checking everything it was discovered that the press had snapped in two. Lesson learned, use strong woods for press.)\nLet 24-72 hours pass (More time reduces chance of delamination.) Begin to loosen clamps and see how the pressing turned out.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FIH/JC9J/IOIWA2UO/FIHJC9JIOIWA2UO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4P/1TAW/IOHGWP63/F4P1TAWIOHGWP63.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Gluing and Pressing"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Cutting out the shape: After obtaining the template sheet from earlier, there are two ways to have your shape be placed onto the plies to begin cutting.\nTrace: Cut out the shape to as close to the outline as possible, then tape the outline on the board and trace the general shape. It is better to have it initially bigger than to cut too much off.\nTape Placement: Using clear tape, wrap the sheet onto the plies, aligning the top of the sheet 1 inch away from the edge of the board on each side along with a margin on the sides.\nOnce the shape is somehow on your plies, clamp down the plies to a secure bench or table and begin to cut the shape out. Following the line, it is recommended to stay a half inch away for sanding later.\nTake out scuffs: Use wood putty to fill in any holes or imperfections if they occur after cutting.\nSanding the board:\nOnce the shape is cut out, sand the extra space away with a belt sander. A Dremel can be used for the curves in the board along with a palm sander for the surfaces. For the edge of the board, I used a trick by CashedOutBoards to have an even edge by cutting a PVC pipe in half and placing 600 grit sand paper in the center. For the wheel wells, I used a pencil case to wrap sandpaper around for the even sanding on edges. Then, using a palm sander at 120 grit for the surfaces followed by a 400 hand sanded and finally a 600 for a ready-to-stain smooth.\nCashedOutBoards Process\nRouting the edges:\nUsing a router, I gave the edge a clean look and a smooth transition. I only routed the bottom of the board, however, you can rout each side.\nDrilling for trucks:\nDrilling holes for the trucks takes patience, you must line up the truck template symmetrically down the middle of the board along with having the trucks an equal distance from each edge.

Some ways are cheaper than other but sacrifice the detail and color.\nSharpie and acrylic paint $\nAcrylic transfer $$\nSpray paint $\nAirbrush paint $$$\nVinyl print $$$$\nI used a vinyl print, the most expensive but gives a bright color. My image was hand drawn, scanned in and relayered in Illustrator. Then given to a vinyl service and print out. For the application, the same steps as the griptape, laying the print on the board and taping down for a secure fit and excess cut off with razor. As far as the internet, there are not a ton of videos on how to do this, I will give a link to the one I used. Also, if you would like cheaper route, acrylic transfers work great too.\nVinyl application\nPreserve:\nTo protect the vinyl or any design that has been placed on the board, use a dual seal spray paint, resistant to water and protects from sunlight, does not yellow unlike polyurethanes and spar urethane and can bond to the vinyl easily.\nMounting:\nThis is the final step for making a complete longboard!

They're accurate, and will save you time making and testing your own. But you can make your own accurate template:\nMake a Hinge Mortise Router Template\nTake a piece of MDF, about 300x200mm (12\"x8\"). Bore a hole, midway along the length and centered about 75mm (3\") in from one edge. The diameter of the hole, together with the router guide bush and cutter diameters will determine the diameter of the routed mortise, so you may need to do a little math! But the following may help.\nFor my 35mm hinges, I bored a 48mm (1-7/8\") hole with a forstener bit, and used a 20mm (13/16\") guide bush with a 6.35mm (1/4\") cutter. This should have made a hole too small, but the bored hole was slightly over 48mm, and the mortise was spot on.\nThe math goes like this:\nDifference between guide radius and cutter radius = (20/2)-(6.35/2) = 6.825\nTherefore, radius of mortise cut using the template = (48/2)-6.825 = 17.175\nAnd so, diameter of mortise = 2 x 17.175 = 34.35mm\nFor a 26mm hinge, you might try a 40mm (1-9/16) hole with the same guide bush and cutter. The math would suggest the mortise would be a little loose, but by winding a few turns of tape around the guide bush first, you could creep up on a good fit, removing a turn of tape at a time.\nThe combination you use will depend on the forstener bits you have, and the guide bushes and cutters to hand. You may even get away with using a forstener bit to bore the mortise, but it has to be vertical as well as a good fit, and the tip of many bits will go through the thickness of the door before the mortise is deep enough.\nTo copy the exact locations of the mortises from the old door, place the template so that the hole is concentric with the mortise and clamp two battens on it that touch adjacent edges of the door. Now lift it off the old door and place on the new one, aligning it to the edges with the battens. Clamp in place.\nPlace the unpowered router on the template, with the guide bush in the hole, and plunge the cutter until it contacts the door. Lock the plunge, and then set the depth stop to the thickness of the hinge 'tenon'. Release the plunge lock. You're now ready to cut the mortise. Take it in a few passes at increasing depth.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMW/XS9H/IOEKBT68/FMWXS9HIOEKBT68.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFW/S0W8/IOEKBT6D/FFWS0W8IOEKBT6D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXA/A49T/IOEKBT7H/FXAA49TIOEKBT7H.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Cut the Hinge Mortises"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "Your door is ready to finish now.\nAll surfaces that have been cut should be fine sanded before painting the door.

However, I was quite pleased with the result and when I saw the title of the \"Reclaimed Wood\" contest I felt obligated to go back and try to document the steps I recently took to make this beauty. Sorry ahead of time if there are missing pictures or explanations. Feel free to ask me any questions and thanks for reading this!\nSummary: I was tearing out a wall in my 80yr old foursquare colonial home so that I could expand the bathroom. This created a pile of semi-rough-cut heart pine 2x4s and one 4x6. Much to my wife's chagrin I refused to toss them so they sat out in the weather all winter. Finally a few months ago I decided to stack them on top of the base cabinets of the covered outdoor kitchen I have been slowly constructing. At that moment, an idea was born... (see picture in the next step). Being undecided on what I was going to use for my outdoor countertop I figured why not give the reclaimed wood bartop a shot. Since the countertop would be shielded from the rain and snow by a large covered porch roof, the biggest concern I had with using wood outside was the large changes in humidity and the resulting expansion and shrinkage of the wood across the seasons. I spoke with some friends who are professional carpenters and they seemed fairly unconcerned about that factor, so I decided to take a chance and give it a try. You'll see that I went to extra lengths to provide plenty of structural support so that any potential warping, shrinkage, or expansion should be minimal. The following is how I approached it.\nBelow are the MATERIALS I used (but feel free to substitute where you see fit).\nReclaimed 2x4s (ripped down to 2x2s)\nReclaimed 4x6 (a 4x4 would work fine as well)\n(3) 24in+ lengths of threaded rod (I think I used 3/8in thickness of rods)\n(6) matching nuts, (6) wide flat washers & (6) lock washers\nPlenty of 2 1/2in screws (I used galvanized decking screws since it's an outdoor project, however 99% of the screws will be buried within the bartop so galvanized may not be necessary)\nFinishing nails (to nail next to the flat spots on the nuts to keep them from rotating)\nWood glue (Titebond II)\nWood filler (I used black wood filler, it's harder to find but I like this better than the natural color filler)\nWood stain (I used \"mosquito\" red...)\nIndoor / Outdoor polyurethane\nBelow are the TOOLS I used (but feel free to substitute where you see fit).\n1/2in drill bit (for drilling holes for the threaded rods)\n1in+ paddle bit (...or other appropriate size, for creating a snug pocket for the nuts to fit into)\nMultiple grits of sandpaper (I primarily used 60, 80, 200+ since that's what I had available)\nLarge 24in+ clamps (for squeezing the boards together after glued, ...bar clamps would be ideal)\nTable saw (this was helpful for ripping my 2x4s into 2x2s, and for squaring up the sides)\nChop saw or Skill saw (to cut the boards to the correct length)\nDrill / power screwdriver\nOrbital sander\nRouter with 1/2in Roundover Bit (This was for rounding out the edges of the sink cutout)", "title": "Reclaimed Wood Bartop", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Reclaimed-Wood-Bartop/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I had a few challenges to overcome.\nNot all of my boards were long enough for the 90\" countertop length.\nI wanted to make efficient use of the wood since I have a coffee table project I want to try as well.\nSome of the boards had developed a slight warp-age. -possibly due to the rain and snow of winter :-)\nDue to other factors, the base cabinets were already sitting approx 4inches higher than a normal cabinet/countertop would sit. If I was to make a 4\" thick countertop then it would be over 6+ inches higher than the standard height. I wanted to avoid this if possible.\nI was convinced that I wanted threaded rods going through it for strength and stability but I wasn't sure that I wanted the ends of the rods to be visible along the front edge.\nSo here is how I addressed these issues.\nSince I knew I would be cutting out a section for the sink I realized I could use some of my short boards in the middle of the countertop by simply pre-cutting them and sliding them down to the end.\nI carefully measured and laid out both projects ahead of time to make sure that there would sufficient materials for both, this is when I decided to incorporate one newer (but still old) 2x4 I had salvaged from a previous project. You'll notice two strips that have a slighty lighter coloring than the rest. I kind of liked the idea of adding this variation anyway.\nA lot of trial and error with dry fitting the boards next to each other so that their slight warps would complement each other. I ended up numbering the boards in sequence once I had them in the desired position and order.\nI decided to rip the 2x4s into 2x2s to keep my countertop height closer to standard. This also helped me stretch the availability of my materials. But in a final twist, I still wanted the countertop to appear to be 3-4\" thick on it's visible edge. For the edge piece I chose to use the 4x6 and cut it into an \"L\" shape.\nI decided to have the threaded rods go only through the 2x2s. The nut/bolts on the end could then be covered by an inside pocket drilled into the 4x6.\nStep #1 - ripped the 2x4s down the middle to make them 2x2s. Note: Since I had the tablesaw out for this step anyway, I SHOULD have gone the extra mile and also trimmed/squared up the sides of these boards as well. This would have made them much closer to a perfect \"square\" shape. Since I did not, the boards remained slightly out-of-square at times which technically made them parralellograms or trapezoids. This fact was not obvious at first, but after I began glueing & screwing them together these slightly out-of-square shapes created unnecessary gaps/seams and a very slight bow to the surface. Bottom line: if I could do it over again I would definitely square up the sides at the outset.\nStep #2 - carefully pre-drilled holes for the threaded rods at the EXACT same position on each board. Since the boards had slight variations in height, I also measured to the top (exposed) side of the board, figuring that if the underside of the countertop was uneven - who cares.\nStep #3 - Removed material from the underside of the 4x6 to make it into an \"L\" shape. In the end I also had to remove some from the bottom lip as well since it was hitting the top of the drawer face on the cabinet. This made it closer to a 3\" thickness on the front face. (see picture)\nStep #4 - Created small snug pockets on the inside edge of the 4x6 for the nuts/bolts end to fit in. I also wanted to be able to tighten the nuts/rods (from the other end) so it was important to me that the nuts would not spin inside the pockets. I ended up securing the nuts into the pockets first with small nails hammered into the flat spots around the nuts. (see picture - these were before the nails were hammered into place) Once the nuts felt reasonably secure I moved on to the next step.\nStep #5 - Threaded the lock washers, flat washers, and rods into the pockets nuts.\nStep #6 - Began dropping the numbered boards onto the threaded rods one at a time and gluing and screwing them to the board below it making sure to keep the top edge as even as possible so that I would have to do minimal sanding to the finished top. (see picture) The picture shows the underside of a dry fit I did just before I began step #5. Finish it off with the final flat washers, lock washers and nuts.\nStep #7 - Set the countertop on the cabinets, clamped it tight, and then tightened it further with the threaded rods & washers. I knew this was working because I could see glue being squeezed out of the joints. After it was sufficiently tightened I went back and cut off the excess threaded rod that was sticking out the back.\nStep #8 - Let the glue dry.

This comprehensive approach allowed us to fill in the old nail holes, the natural cracks in the wood, the seams, and the low spots in the wood. This also meant that we had to sand the excess black wood filler back off. We lost a little bit of the character in this second sanding step (e.g. saw marks) but it really brought out some other character that would not have been as obvious without this step.\nPersonally, I love the contrast that the black filler provides verses the more subtle natural color filler, but to each his own.\nAfter everything was filled and sanded to our satisfaction it was finally time to stain it.

I attached them to the back of the sign with hot glue. I then attached a saw tooth picture frame hanger to the top block. I was hanging it on drywall so I used a plastic wall anchor and screw. Of course with mounting anything your method will vary. The lights are powered by a 12v wall transformer, so there is a wire hanging down the wall from the sign.

Nice wood is too expensive to allow for careless mistakes.\n\nFYI.

So if you absolutely feel the need to clamp the hell out of the piece, use some clamping cauls (small blocks of wood) between the clamp ends and the piece, this distributes the pressure s bit. I prefer to use cam clamps, they are quick, easy and controllable.\n\nTapering the sides is optional, but I think it adds a nice hand crafted touch.\n\nWhen drawing out the angle you will plane off, be mindful of the dowel rods you inserted and the drill cavities. If you are not careful you will plane right into them and then it is too late.\n\nI simply set a spare piece of stock down on the edge of the work bench so my work piece floats above the bench, clamp down the stock and the work piece so the planing surface is all available, and go at it.\n\nThe good thing about mahagony is that it is real easy to work so planing goes quick. Don't get too carried away however, go slow and easy, plane in the direction of the grain or sightly angled into the grain direction, and always use a straight edge along the top surface to ensure the work area remains flat and true. Plane long deliberate cuts, put some muscle in to it, but be in control.\n\nLastly, you can sand down the edges or, as I did, use a laminate trimer/router to put a nice quarter round on all edges.\n\nNote: routers are dangerous, be smart cut in the right direction (I won't tell you the right direction , forces you to go look it up!), be careful when routing down the edge of the taper", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F53/AXJP/IOCJ6XHG/F53AXJPIOCJ6XHG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6C/RZGF/IOCJ6XUO/F6CRZGFIOCJ6XUO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY3/2KLR/IOCJ6XWT/FY32KLRIOCJ6XWT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8M/F2AH/IOCJ6XXB/F8MF2AHIOCJ6XXB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD5/W1DV/IOCJ6XXT/FD5W1DVIOCJ6XXT.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: Glue It, Then Taper the Sides, Route Edges If So Desired"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "I am a fan of inlay.

I kept the circuit board to make use of the 1/4\" mounted input jack but disconnected any lines from the jack to the rest of the circuit by scratching away the pcb line connections with a razor blade and a screwdriver. The potentiometer was replaced with a 5K pot as described on most hobbyist sites and MC60 controller schematics available online. I wired a female XLR jack to the MC-60 5K pot connections and connected the pedal to this jack via a 1/4\" jack to female XLR cable. Because I wanted the wheel to start at a slow speed with the pedal adjusted \"down\" and move to a reasonable high speed when fully \"up\", I had to:\n1. Clip the resistor R15 to remove the \"slow start\" feature (link). This allows the wheel to start spinning when power is turned on w/o having to adjust the pedal to \"0\". This also allowed me to install the pot without needing to make sure that it could be brought to actual \"0\".\n2. Install the pot such that the \"down\" setting started at a value higher than 0.\n3. Use a screwdriver to adjust the speed multiplier on the MC-60.\nI tweaked (2) and (3) until I found an acceptable speed range with smooth adjustment acceleration.\nNote that if using the current pot mount and default wiring scheme is used, the pedal works opposite to that of a car pedal: depressing the pedal with slow the wheel down. This could be reversed by either installing a mount on the opposite side of the pedal or perhaps reversing the wiring and tweaking the speed multiplier on the MC-60.

Alternatively, you can drive mortises into the legs and carve matching tenons from the ends of the skirts or use capped screws which are drilled from the outside faces.\nSince my table needed to be moved, I used two dominoes on the long sides (which I glued ahead of time), with a single domino and two screws on the short side. The domino I glued in place on one side while the screws could be added by the buyer.\nAside from the primary joints, you\u2019ll need a way to hold both the bottom of the shadowbox as well as the lower shelf in place. I added dadoes to the inside of each skirt and stretcher which were sized to fit the plywood I had cut for each one (a little under 1/2\u201d). I also made the upper dadoes a little wider so that they\u2019d fit the suede fabric floor.\nAdditionally, you\u2019ll need to tackle the corners; you can cut the floor around the legs or vice-versa. I ended up dry-fitting everything and marking the insides of the stretcher dadoes on the legs. From there, I used a hand saw to remove the notches from the corners and cleaned them up with a chisel.

I\u2019m all about not wasting time and materials but if you can make a change that will make the buyer happy, go for it. I had already cut my legs at 24\u201d when my customer decided they\u2019d rather have the table at 17\u201d; this made it a more manageable size for a coffee table. At 24 it was a beast.\nThe easiest way I could do this was by cutting the top 5\u201d away from the legs (right to the bottom of the original notches), and taking the remainder from the dead space below the lower shelf. Cons: lost 7\u201d of leg length, 1/8 or so of width, had to re-cut dominoes/notches. Pros: happy client\u2026 in the end it was an easy modification to make.\nAdditionally, I attached flag triangles and a coin rack to the inside of the box. The flag holders are 16\u201d long, >2.5\u201d tall and are seated in the upper corners to contain a folded, 3x5\u2019 flag. Since the sides were getting kind of thin, I decided to pre-drill holes in the floor and attach them with screws from the bottom. I like using a large edge-trimming bit on the outside of the triangles and reduce it to a smaller profile for the inside so that it doesn\u2019t get in the way of the flag.\nThe coin rack followed the same design style. Cut a thicker piece of matching material to fit between the triangles and route the front edge with a similar profile. Use a dado blade or several passes on a table saw to cut 1-3 notches 1/4\u201d thick at 30-45 degrees. For a normal desktop coin holder a shallow pitch is fine but since these will be viewed from above, a steeper angle is more appropriate.\nThe front skirt also displays a specialty badge.

To build ours, start with a board at least 1\u201d thick. The corner joints will be half-lap mitered joints with a dado on the miter side to hold the glass.\nTo cut the joints, begin with a 45 degree miter on one side of each of the four pieces. Mark the middle of the edge and use a dado blade to cut back the bottom side at 90 degrees. This will leave you with a mitered tab \u00bd\u201d thick that will rest on top of the facing side.\nOn the other side, you only be able to cut through the top half of the miter. You can do this with a table saw if you\u2019ve got a long enough miter gauge, but I\u2019ve found it easier to set a depth stop on a miter saw and cut it with a series of slices. Get as close as possible with the saw and use a file or small plane to go the rest of the way. Test fit the pieces until the tops are uniform around the entire length and the entire piece lays flat.\nContinue by using a table saw with a dado blade to cut a slot on the mitered, interior face of each piece to hold the glass. A depth of \u00bd is sufficient for most tables although I went with \u00be since it\u2019s a little on the large side.\nPre-drill and install some small screws in each corner so that they don\u2019t impact the glass nor the routed edges. I advise against gluing these so that the owner can replace the glass should disaster strike.

If you cut the slots too wide, when you try to put the pieces together, the two halves will be loose and won't fit together well.\nFor the circles for each bottle slot, measure in each direction to mark the center of the circle. You won't need to draw the circles, the hole saw will take care of that.\nAnd make sure to measure twice, so that you don't make a mistake before you start cutting.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSB/GEVO/IO6E1DUU/FSBGEVOIO6E1DUU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSA/7GG0/IO8LAVOV/FSA7GG0IO8LAVOV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F01/1UTP/IO6E1E2Q/F011UTPIO6E1E2Q.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Measure Twice, Cut Once"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "Now that you've laid out your cuts, it's time to get cutting!\n\nI cut the slots in each half first - you'll need 2 identical slots that will mirror each other.\n\nFirst cut the two long cuts with the table saw, then finish it with a chisel for a neater edge. These edges will get sanded so they don't have to be perfect. Remember to check where your blade cuts - you want a tight fit so that your wine doesn't wobble! Cut both pieces to have a slot.\nTABLE SAW NOTE: Make sure not to cut the entire length of the slot that's marked on the top of each board with your table saw. If you do, the blade on the bottom of the board will cut longer into the wood, and you'll see those marks once the rack is put together. Instead, stop short so that your saw blade only cuts to the end of where the slot is supposed to be. You'll have to make a few cuts to verify this length, for me it was about 1.75\".\nYou can also drill some corner holes at the ends of your slots to make the cutting/chiseling easier. I didn't do this, and I regret it - I highly recommend that you do.\nNow is a great time for a fit check - try to put the two halves together. Mine were a little tight, but after making a bad cut with a really loose fit, that was ok with me.

This may seem trivial for those of you sitting on the couch reading this, but it's very important because the hole bit will dig in and try VERY VERY hard to throw your wood right back at you. So use some clamps to secure your work, you'll avoid some nasty injuries.\nAfter you've secured your wood, line the pilot bit in the hole bit up with the center of the holes, and start cutting. I had a hard time with the cordless drill having enough power to cut through the 1/2\" plywood, so for each hole I cut halfway through and then flipped each piece over to finish the hole from the other side. You'll be able to use the pilot hole to center the bit and finish the cut. This can be a pain because you have to keep unclamping and reclamping, but this also helps with avoiding tearout, which will be a pain to cover up later.\nCut all three of the holes in one piece, then switch pieces and cut the other three.

Remember, the less blade is exposed, the safer the user will be. Always set the blade guide just high enough to clear the part you are cutting.\nAcrylic is a material that has a low melting point. In my experience, acrylic will melt at high feed rates and crack at low feed rates, therefore find a steady speed to push the acrylic at that isn't too fast or too slow. If you are a novice in machining, this experience will come in time through practice. Enough experience will allow you to physically feel the optimal speeds during machining.\nApply a steady pressure when easing the acrylic across the blade.

Also make sure that the edges of the acrylic are parallel to that of the table\u2019s edges so that a straight cut will be performed.\nUse a flat end mill thats diameter is larger than that of the length being milled (the edge of the acrylic to the first measurement made). Also make sure that this end mill\u2019s diameter is a bit larger than the acrylic\u2019s thickness. I used a 1/2\u201d end mill.\nLine up the end mill to the starting position located on the acrylic using the x, y and z axes.\nBefore turning on the spindle, make sure the spindle is about an inch away from the edge of the acrylic.\nAlso make sure that the machine is in high gear.\nTurn on the spindle by pushing the upper lever downwards (pictured in step 9). However, the direction in which you turn the lever (up or down) is determined by whether you're using conventional milling or climb milling. Will the spindle be spinning in the opposite direction of the desired cut or will the spindle be spinning in the direction of the desired cut? Learn more about it here: http://www.datron.com/blog/climb-milling-vs-conventional-milling/.\nOnce the spindle is on, adjust the speed of the acrylic between 1100-1500 rpms. The spindle must always be on before changing the spindle speeds!\nSince you are manually moving the table to do the finishing pass, the feed rate isn\u2019t really something that can be determined. Instead move the table fast enough as to not crack the acrylic, but slow enough to not melt the acrylic.\nWhen milling along the length of the acrylic, only move the x axis. When milling along the width of the piece, only move along the y axis.\nEach pass should be no more than -0.05\u201d in depth. Therefore multiple passes must be done in order to mill off the edges. You can keep track of the coordinates by using the mill\u2019s monitor by pressing the button DRO. Use the air hose to clear the debris off of the end mill.

If you are only engraving a small depth into a piece, the support material underneath the acrylic is unnecessary. However, if you plan to mill slots, holes, or other geometries that will go through the acrylic, a support piece is necessary.\nWe find the origin by pressing the button DRO. This will take us to the next screen, which displays the x, y, and z coordinates.\nChoose the leftmost, bottom corner to be the origin of the acrylic. Zero each axis by placing the end mill against the left edge of the acrylic. Press DATUM and then press X=0. Next press USE. Since we want the origin to be the center of the end mill, move the end mill above the acrylic in the positive x direction about the length of the radius of your edge finder.\nPress DATUM once again and zero the x-axis.\nChoose the next side of the acrylic, front-most edge, and place the end mill against it. Press DATUM and then press Y=0. Next press USE. Since we want the origin to be the center of the end mill, move the end mill above the acrylic in the positive y direction about the length of the radius of your edge finder.\nFor the Z-axis, place the end mill a hair length above the acrylic. One can do this by using the cigarette paper trick. Instead of using cigarette paper, take a piece of computer paper, apply oil to the surface and place it on the acrylic. Take the end mill and lower it until it is touching the paper. You can tell that it is above the piece if you tug at the paper and it does not entirely come off or if you turn on the spindle and the paper gets caught on the end mill. I do not recommend turning on the spindle when finding the z-axis manually unless you are experienced. The piece of paper is about 0.001\u201d and therefore once the sweet spot has been found we can set the z-axis to -.001\u201d to find Z=0.\nMake sure that you are satisfied with the z retract and once your are done with this process, press the button PGM labeled with the blue circle.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1N/V1ND/IO8L74U3/F1NV1NDIO8L74U3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTN/955I/IO8L74U5/FTN955IIO8L74U5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKH/5FM3/IO8L74U6/FKH5FM3IO8L74U6.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Engraving the Acrylic: Part III"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "Once your origin has been established, press MORE OPTIONS until you find ENGRAVE LINE.\nDepending on where you position your clamps and how large your acrylic piece is, place in the necessary compensation needed to move the spindle along the x and y axes to avoid those regions. Due to the way my acrylic was set up, I used 0.5\u201d of compensation along the x-axis and 1\u201d of compensation along the y-axis.\nBefore deciding on the character height make sure you know how large your acrylic piece is and the full length of the letters you are engraving. Character width is about 70% of character height. Meaning that based on the character height I chose, it will give me letters that are about 1 3/4\u201d in height and about 1 1/4\u201d in width. This changes depending on the types of letters used. Letters that are thinner, such as As and Is will only be about 40% of the character height widthwise. Furthermore we must also take into account the spaces between each letter, which is measured to be about 5/16\u201d.\nTherefore if 7 of my letters are about 1 1/4\u201d in width, 2 of my letters are 3/4\u201d (40%) and there are 8 spaces each 5/16\u201d apart, the total length of my longest word will be about 12 3/4\u201d- 13\u201d. Make sure to compensate a quarter to half an inch.\nSince my acrylic piece is 14\u201d in length, and I estimated my longest word to be 13 inches, it makes sense to have a compensation of 1/2\u201d in the x-axis so that the letters are at least centered lengthwise.\nSince I chose 1.6\u201d in height, there are two lines of words and about 1/2\u201d of space between both of them, the full height would be estimated to about 4\u201d. Meaning that 1\u201d of compensation from the upper right corner will center my phrase widthwise since my acrylic is 6\u201d widthwise.\nOf course you should play with the option and do a few dry runs (we\u2019ll get to this) in order to fully estimate the length and width of your characters. This comes down to practice.\nOnce you have chosen a height or even before you have chosen a height, enter your text by pressing EDIT TEXT. This will take you to the screen in the left picture. Choose your characters. If you need to edit a character press TEXT BLOCK to edit and then press CHARACTERS to return the keyboard. Once finished press USE. Remember to always press USE when you are finished with a program and setting an origin.\nNext, choose your Begin Height for the z-axis which should be zero. Your End Height will be the entire depth the end mill plunges. Therefore I chose -0.05. Do not forget to input this value as a negative!\nSince this is acrylic, change the feed rate to 5 imps (inches per minute) for both the z-axis and the tool. The feed rate value will usually be lower for metals and higher for wood and plastics.\nPress USE when satisfied.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F90/74SE/IO8L758I/F9074SEIO8L758I.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1X/A4A6/IO8L758J/F1XA4A6IO8L758J.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Engraving the Acrylic: Part IV"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "After pressing USE, it will take you to the home screen where the programs have been set.

This will allow the end mill to safely mill through the wooden surface without having to plunge on its own. Even though wood is soft its best to take the right safety and finish precautions.\nAfter, use a 3/8\u201d ball end mill (since the acrylic is a 1/4\u201d) so that the sign has enough wiggle room to rest at a slight angle.\nSince wood is soft enough to prevent the risk of breaking the end mill, larger passing depths can be obtained.

I in no way intend to give an expert look at pen turning. Rather, I'd like to share my perspective after scouring the internet for guides and applying that knowledge to my first turnings. This guide will point out pitfalls and explain things that were unclear once I got in the trenches and turned my own pen.\nFor my first pen, I was equipped with the mini-lathe from Harbor Freight and their High Speed Steel chisel set. You could spend more, but my research and budget dictated this as a starting point. My initial reservations about reliability and build quality have been cleared -- it's very stable, as compared to their scroll saw and some of my other consumer-grade power tools. Mine requires manual belt tensioning to change the speed, but it's very straightforward.\nThe rest of my supplies for this were purchased from Craft Supplies USA/WoodTurner's Catalog. I searched for the best prices on blanks, pen kits, starter sets (mandrels, bushing, etc...) and found no one cheaper. I bought the apprentice starter kit, some extra blanks, and a micro mesh kit.", "title": "Purpleheart Pen: Turning Your First Pen", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Purpleheart-Pen-Turning-Your-First-Pen/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "The blanks in the kit were already cut to rough thickness, but still needed to be cut to rough length for the brass tubes. Most guides will talk about all the different options for cutting the blanks and how you should leave about a 1/4 inch extra per tube. I got the bright idea to use my scroll saw. It's not the most accurate thing in my shop, but the blade definitely wandered on me and nearly left me with a short blank. I would recommend something like a hand saw or table/chop saw for a more predictable cut. I corrected the wandering by nibbling away some of the angle it left and utilizing the guide to keep the piece from bouncing off the blade. I've been used to working with pine and pallet oak, so the harder purpleheart was a little bit of a surprise. Be sure to mark the blank so you can better match the grain direction. If there's a prettiest part of the blank, make sure it's in the pen (and not the off-cut) portion of your layout. My grain was pretty even throughout.\nMy blanks, and most of the commercially sold blanks, were very square. I did not purchase a center finder, but instead opted to trace a straightedge corner to corner and drill in the intersection. Getting a straight cut when dividing them makes this easier! Not having a drill-press, I drilled carefully and slowly with the provided 7mm bradpoint bit. The bradpoint keeps the bit centered, more so that a regular twist-bit, but won't hide poor drill alignment. To hold the workpiece, I used an unmodified wooden handscrew. Many people make or modify them to hold the blank, but I had very little issue using it as-is. It is recommended to drill the hole from the center for better grain-matching, since any angle to it would be magnified by the length of the blank.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FF3/8MDL/IO7GS591/FF38MDLIO7GS591.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOU/YXVS/IO7GS592/FOUYXVSIO7GS592.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FCV/3HQL/IO7GS593/FCV3HQLIO7GS593.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif"], "step_title": "Step 1: Preparing the Blank"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "Once the holes are drilled, they're ready to receive the brass tubes which are provided with the pen kits. They come pristine and need to be scuffed to better hold the glue or epoxy.\nI used some old, leftover 220 disks from my random orbital sander -- there's nothing precise about this step. My kit included some medium thickness Cyanoacrylate (CA/Krazy) glue. You could also use epoxy, but the CA is probably cheaper and easier to use. Accelerator is not required for this application of the CA glue, and for me, it sets up fast enough not to need any help.\nAfter the glue is set, and I figured it was set after the spilled stuff on my fingers hardened, the blanks will need to be trimmed to the length of the tube. My starter set came with a barrel-trimmer and center bits for various diameter pen tubes. Select the one that matches your pen kit and tighten the mill with an allen wrench, generally provided with the trimmer. The tube will act mostly like a bearing around the central bit, but the mill will cut through the brass -- trim until just a hint of the brass tube is trimmed. You'll know you're done when the brass shines. This is another operation that is often done on the drill press. I had less trouble with this on the handheld drill than the hole itself. Both ends of both blanks need to be trimmed. I got fairly close with the length of my blanks, but I imagine they can be as proud in either direction as the gap that the bushings allow. It is possible to trim too much with the barrel mill -- while your pen length can be slightly shorter and still accommodate the refill, it could be too short for the mandrel (ask me how I know).", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTB/6WJE/IO7GS5AB/FTB6WJEIO7GS5AB.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH7/CSWH/IO7GS5AT/FH7CSWHIO7GS5AT.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGG/MZMW/IO7GS5BT/FGGMZMWIO7GS5BT.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif"], "step_title": "Step 2: Brass Barrel"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The morse taper end of the pen mandrel is mounted in the headstock, following the lathe manufacturer's instructions. There should be a knurled wheel on the opposite end. Mine arrived with the knurled piece frozen in place from shipping. I was able, due to impatience, to unscrew the mandrel from the tapered end and load my bushings and blanks opposite of the normal order, rescrew the mandrel into the taper, tighten the tailstock's cup center to the divot in the end of the mandrel. This should only be tightened enough to support it; not enough to bend or warp the mandrel. I'll probably make the small investment in a mandrel saver, which is designed to put the force on the bushings instead of the mandrel, keeping it from warping or causing the blank to run out of true and making for sloppy turnings.\nFollowing best safety protocol, I checked several things:\nEnsure all pieces are locked in place\nManually rotate the headstock (mine has a handwheel) and ensure work does not wobble or contact tool rest\nEnsure lathe is set to lowest speed\nNone of the work pieces shows any signs of cracking\nI won't preach the merits of dust collection/respirators/hearing protection or any of the other boilerplate shop safety.

I had plenty of thickness left, even given the angle I'd inadvertently drilled my holes at. I first brought my pieces to round with a roughing gouge. It's best to start lightly until the flats have been brought down. If the pieces stop turning along with the mandrel, there's probably not enough tension across the blanks/bushings. If the knob on the mandrel is fully engaged, an extra bushing or spacer could help. I moved from the gouge to a flat, round-nosed chisel for most of the shaping.\nI chose a fairly even cylinder for the rear half of the pen and a bulbous tear-drop for the front. Most of this was by feel and was helped by taking my time and going slowly. The bushings, while also keeping the blanks apart and in place, are the same diameter as the pieces of the pen kit they represent. I used these to visualize how I wanted the parts to flow, tapering to and from the diameter of the bushing, but also to ensure that I didn't carve too deeply into the blank. It is important to keep from hitting these with the chisels or sandpaper and altering them. It wouldn't be unreasonable to order a replacement set of bushings - If not for when they get damaged, they're also very small and easily lost.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FU2/87V5/IO7GS5CH/FU287V5IO7GS5CH.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FA7/OXMS/IO7GS5CS/FA7OXMSIO7GS5CS.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGE/ECDR/IO6DYPNG/FGEECDRIO6DYPNG.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Turn, Turn, Turn"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "One thing that surprised me, maybe more than anything else, was how aggressive sandpaper shaped on the lathe. It stands to reason from the rpm of the lathe, but wasn't readily apparent or explicit in what I'd read/watched beforehand. I started with 60/80 grit, moved onto 120, 220, and 320. I used all previously used, dry sandpaper. It's important to keep the paper moving -- it gets pretty warm from the friction.\nAfter getting everything to a satisfactory finish with the 320 grit, I moved on to micro mesh. The first grit in my pack was equivalent in coarseness to 400 grit sandpaper, but according to the manufacturer has a much higher uniformity pattern. Following the manufacturer's instructions, I used circular motions and kept the pads moving to keep them from melting/burning. I went all the way through to 12,000 grit micro mesh. It's probably pretty unnecessary to go that far.\nMy starter pack included a bottle of friction polish. I applied it to the work piece while the lathe was powered down, using some Taco Bell napkins. Though some instructions I read mention using a rag, it's safer to use a paper towel or napkin to apply finish on a lathe. Cloth can snag and wrap around between centers, but paper is more likely to tear/break before damage to one's hands could occur. The instructions say to apply while stopped and turn after the finish soaks-in/dries, then using friction and heat, the finish turns high gloss. I didn't have any wax on hand, but I understand that this increases both the look of the finish and the durability. I'm quite pleased with the finish, even without the wax.

I dropped the pen blank on the lathe bed while removing it the wrong way. I'm pretty sure it caused a scratch on the pen, but I can't be sure. I'll probably lay down a cloth the next time I do the removal process, just in case.\nI laid out the parts at the suggestion of the instruction sheet that came with my kit. It seems silly, but it probably went a little faster as a result. First, I inserted the pen tip into the front half of the blank and tightened a pistol grip clamp around it. There are plenty of store-bought unitasker presses to do these operations, but I didn't see the need and experience has now proven that they're not necessary. It was easy to see what everyone was talking about -- the pen kit parts will quite easily not stay straight as you go to press them together, but it doesn't seem difficult to right them along the way either. Next was the twist mechanism. Another big unknown for me was how far to press in the twist mechanism. My instructions said something like \"to the line,\" but there were multiple lines or stops. I'd also been warned with all the parts that pressing too far would be permanent, so I was worried about accidentally going too far. As it turned out, I didn't press far enough the first two times. I figured this out when the pen's tip didn't extend far enough. It ended up being the furthest mark on the twist mechanism, not just the brass section.\nFinally, the cap fits into the clip and both are pressed into the rear of the rear blank. A beauty ring slides over the twist-mech, the ink refill drops in, and the rear blank slides on to meet the ring. Now we have a pen! If you did any solid grain-matching, make sure to slide the rear down with the grain lined up while the nib is closed or open.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWP/WXZI/IO7GS5DU/FWPWXZIIO7GS5DU.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FH3/MB2U/IO7GS5FL/FH3MB2UIO7GS5FL.ANIMATED.LARGE.gif"], "step_title": "Step 6: Assembly"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "I'm super stoked about how my pen turned out.

It has made you think.\nIn the 21st century we are becoming increasingly concerned and observant of the ever-changing climate and resources upon this earth, as we should be. I am a big believer in sustainable furniture. I like to use recycled timber in my work whenever possible.\nThis flat pack collapsible desk uses timber from old government issue desks. The desks have several nail holes, dowels and other imperfections. I disguised these as best as possible, but in the end, I sort of leaned into the reclaimed look.\nThis Flat Pack Desk uses Tasmanian Oak and common woodworking tools and machinery. I used the tools I have because I have them. That does not mean that they are the only way to accomplish certain tasks. There is no point going out and buying a new tool if you can do it someway else. In this Instructable I am going to share some knowledge on hand cut joinery and some design tips.\nAt the end of this Instructable I explain where this table might be useful.\nI have entered this project in the Flat Pack and Reclaimed Wood contests, so please vote for me.\nDisclaimer: I nor Instructables can be held responsible for any damages or injury with tools or machinery.\nTools:\nTable saw\nRouter\nBelt Sander\nCordless drill (or drill press)\nDrill Bits\nHand tools (planes, spokeshaves, files, chisels etc.)\nBandsaw (or Jig saw)\nMarking-out equipment\nPaintbrushes\nSandpaper\nMaterials:\nReclaimed timber (Tasmanian Oak)\n6mm hardwood Dowel\nVarnish\nWood glue\n3mm MDF", "title": "Flat Pack Trestle Table", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Flat-Pack-Trestle-Table/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "I really like the curved flowing design of the Mid-Century Modern design movement. I wanted to incorporate curved and angled legs into the trestle table. They add an interesting visual design element. I was influenced by Norm Abram, and Marc Spagnolo.\nI began designing this table on paper with some rough sketches. I played around with different versions of the base. It is much easier to change the design on paper, than it is with timber. Once I was happy with the design, I made a full size template using 3mm MDF. I used straight metal rules, curves and household items to draw the full template.\nWhen thinking about the joinery for this piece, I knew I wanted to use traditional, hand cut mortise and tenon joints. To for fill the requirement of being flat pack, I used a tusk tenon (also known as loose key'd tenon) to join the stretcher to the legs. The wedges allow the table to be \"knocked\" apart and stored flat. More on that later.\nI cut the template out on the bandsaw. A jig saw would work just as well.

I used a No 6 handplane with a freshly sharpened blade to remove the layer of varnish before running it through my machines.\nWinter time in Tasmania, is rather cold. In the evening time it can get below 5 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit). The glue I used was Titebond 2. This glue will not bond when it is below 13 degrees Celsius.

I would say that I'm a metalworker at best because that is the material that I work with more frequently. However, in the process of doing some storage related wood projects lately, I ended up investing in and using tools that gave me more confidence and ideas than I really needed with respect to my current skills in woodworking.\nI had no idea what I was getting myself into or really what I was doing at any point. I'm not even sure it will hold up over time or if it was even the best wood to use. In fact, I'm almost positive there is a good reason to not construct a project like this that I am ignorant of.\nIn short, I basically went from 0 to 9000 on this project. Regardless, I persevered to the end of it without messing up the initial vision I had too bad and I'm sharing it in hopes of improving my knowledge with the help of your feedback.\nIt features completely reclaimed wood construction donated from a recently demolished old covered \"pipe stand\" that was outside the shop I work in. It got removed due to poor placement with respect to the building and its lack of functionality. I wish I had pictures of the storage rack/\"pipe stand\" but I don't. I'm fairly certain that the pipe stand was built using used lumber as well so this will be the third generation of reuse if I'm correct. I'm not even sure what species most of it is...maybe someone can tell me? If I had to guess, maybe cedar?\nAnyway, I had some short pieces after using the bulk of the wood to make some shelving and came up with the idea to make a new sunglasses case for my mom on her birthday. That was around a month ago, so now it's shifted into a belated birthday/Mother's day gift.

My mother's sunglasses case was looking really shabby and this idea had instantly formed in my head to just wing this awesome looking case together out of scraps. I took some measurements of the original case and that is the little sticky note you see in the picture. From there, I figured out the minimum width of scrap piece I could use and also, a cumulative total length of what all the small pieces would add up to. This gave me a pretty decent pile of scraps to start working with.\nFirst, I used the \"shiplap\" sections on the boards to rip the other edge square. Most of these pieces were broken on one side with only a few having both shiplap sections intact. These boards having the shiplap feature milled on them is why I suspect the pipe rack was built out of used lumber to start with. There was no reason for the boards to be shiplap the way it was constructed as they were not overlapped.\nI then set my rip fence to the width I needed and ran them all through on the new cut I just made to give me a new pile of scraps and a pile of boards that were all the same width. This measurement was about a half inch more than the actual measurement needed. That was so that I had plenty of material to trim off and square up after the glue up.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FUL/CWMZ/INYU3IKG/FULCWMZINYU3IKG.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FOV/H8CG/INYU3IOZ/FOVH8CGINYU3IOZ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Source the Scraps and Rip to Width"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "I don't have pictures of this step, but I ran two sides on my jointer.

I really wish I had a planer for this step but I'm grateful to have my jointer to at least give me reference edges.\nOnce all the stock was square-ish, I used the table saw sled that I built to cross cut my pieces to length. In retrospect, I could've just used my miter saw but I liked how easily I could clamp a stop block on the sled and was excited about using it because it produced really smooth cuts with almost no tear out.

No biggy, I remember thinking...that was before I realized how tough it is to work with end grain.\nSo still being naive, I went about slowly cutting each side on the table saw to get a relatively square surface to work with on all four sides with a finish blade installed.

It was a flawless plan.\nHere was the first roadblock I hit.\nIn said plan, I would be using the table saw to cut these angles and boom! Slide them through on the right face and done, right? Well it turns out that, even at the max blade height, my table saw wasn't going to make it through the cut. I suppose I could've just carefully cut the piece with a handsaw but where is the fun in that?\nI finally figured out that I could use the compound function of my miter saw to cut the angle. Both saws are 10\", but because the miter saw allows the arbor to get closer to the material, the cut capacity is more. Now, this is all good and well, but that made holding the blank while cutting it safely very difficult. I managed to get the job done using some clamps and a solid back up to provide a friction hold as well as down pressure with a push stick. I made sure to make these cuts very, very slowly and to always be aware of everything.\nSomehow the cut was actually off. I don't know if it moved in the \"clamp\" setup that I had going on or if I lined it up wrong initially. It cut squarely but one side was bigger than the other.

So I found some hinges that I thought would work, ordered them, and then changed the layout line on the back to add and 1/8\" to leave enough material there. That could've been a disaster, although I'm sure I could've sourced shorter screws. Just something to think about.\nI set my router up with the plunge base and a 1/4\" straight bit and freehanded most of the material out in successive steps. I went in 1/4\" depth increments measuring from the outside and when I thought I was good to drop another 1/4\", I did. Then I went back and did smaller 1/8\" passes in between to remove more material and create finer steps.\nThis was where I was introduced to my second roadblock.\nI thought at this point I could just use a sharp chisel and just smooth all the steps out no problem - wrong.\nThen I thought I could use a dremel and a sanding drum thingy to just sand them down - wrong.\nThen I thought I could just sand them out by hand and technically you could... but for all practical purposes - wrong.\nEnd grain is serious stuff. The final picture is what it looked like after the dremel and it was just not meeting my standards so I had to figure out something else.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FF1/H6N2/INYU3KLB/FF1H6N2INYU3KLB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVO/S325/INYU3KRO/FVOS325INYU3KRO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLD/77MT/INYU3KWW/FLD77MTINYU3KWW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1Q/2K11/INYU3L2V/F1Q2K11INYU3L2V.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVC/J5WP/INYU3L88/FVCJ5WPINYU3L88.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FC0/DKQH/INYU3LCH/FC0DKQHINYU3LCH.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: The Beginning of a Long Road"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Frustrated and defeated I came up with a new solution to get a flat bottom in this angled box.

I know I could've done better but I just couldn't be bothered to when it looked so horrible and still fit the bill just fine.\nIgnoring the big split in the middle of the particle board construction of this piece you can see how it works. It basically is two pieces cut to the same angle as the angles cut on the outside of the case to \"negate\" the angle and provide a plumb base for the router to ride on. The stop block rests on the front edge providing good alignment. I did all the cuts on the miter saw, all out of thin scraps of particle board and plywood. It is held together by brads, no glue.\nNow, with the bottom of the case resting on a flat surface, the jig allows the router to plunge in at one depth and clean the whole inside at an even thickness. It worked good except while concentrating on moving the router close to an edge, the jig fell off the outside and it plunged a bit too deep in a spot. All in all, this provided a way flatter and even surface to work with.

By this time the mini hinges had arrived and I figured, well I've made it this far, lets see if I can split the back with the screws. It was definitely a make or break moment in this project.\nThe way I went about this was pretty straight forward. I first, measured the screw length in the hinge to get my drill depth. Then eyeballed the shank of the screw with different drill bits and finally found one small enough that would fit the bill. I marked the drill bit depth with a bit of masking tape. Then I took the thicker of my cut off scraps and simulated a hinge mounting. This all went well so then I moved on to the actual case.\nThere was two different layouts that I came up with and they were really just a half an inch away from each other. For the longest time I couldn't decide which layout looked better. Then I ended up taking those pictures and swiping back and forth between the two and in that way picked the second layout. It was further away from the edge and a little more centered. I think it would've really been up to preference in this project because its all pretty light duty stuff here and a half an inch either way probably wouldn't have make much difference.\nI marked out the holes using the hinges as a guide and drew center lines to help me. Drilling such a tiny hole really precisely is quite the task. The small bits tend to flex and walk no matter how hard you try. I actually messed up a set of holes in one hinge because the bit followed a grain causing the screw to go in slightly angled. In the first of the pictures I took of the hinges mounted you can tell the screws are misaligned hardcore. I thought I really messed up but I took the screws out and then just carefully re-drilled to relieve some of the material at the top of the hole just very shallow and it went back in no problem. Worked like a charm.\nThese hinges are pretty neat once mounted. They feature an internal 90 degree stop which was part of the reason I bought them. At this point I took a moment to just stare at it for awhile to see what really worked and what didn't.

Not because of the magnets, but because of the hot glue I used to secure them. It stuck really well to the magnets but not to the plastic base I was gluing them too. Long story short, I got these magnets. They are about 1/2\" in diameter and 1/16\" thick with hot glue on them.\nI liberated a few of them from their hot glue confinement with a heat gun and some quick razor blade action.\nI then took a couple to the welding bench and reached straight for my cut off wheel. I instantly felt better. I really didn't know what was going to happen. Turns out you can cut them but it doesn't take much before they shatter unequally probably due to the magnetic field. I wanted to know if they stick back together like that. Turns out they do...but only if you flip one side around. So, there's more going on here than meets the eye, but when you get right down to it, if you cut it in half, flip one side, they stick edge to edge. That's all I needed to know to continue down this rabbit hole.\nI didn't like the fact that the sides were uneven so I cut two more and then ground down the \"bigger halves\" until they were close to a whole magnet again when stuck together.

In my mind, if I was to use these magnets I had, they had to be cut and mounted vertically. In a previous step, I proved they could be cut and still work okay, now I just had to figure out a way to get them in the case without ruining something.\nI played around with tiny cut off wheels and they got the job done but the hole ended up being way to long. I ended up using a dremel with a 1/16\" collet and 1/16\" drill bit to make the slots required to sink the magnets. I used the drill first but it was just too big to be precise. The dremel was light and nimble.\nI basically did a few dry runs in the test piece and got a depth set as well as, comfortable with the process. All it amounted to was drilling a few holes down to the depth tape fairly close together and in a line. Once that was done I would carefully drill in at angles to join the holes, and then finally went side to side to clear any material left over. It probably wasn't the best on that drill bit but I was careful.\nOnce the slots were made in the case halves, I test fit each magnet half and made sure that was where each one would go. I then made sure the polarity was right with the mating magnet half and ran a sharpie over one side so that I wouldn't mix it up. If I did, I'd have a prank case that didn't shut.

My bets are on both at this time with a slight emphasis on the cheap brush. Learn from me and just buy a quality brush if you plan on using polyurethane. I didn't think it was going to matter but it evidently does.\nI've read where you can wet sand polyurethane like a car finish and buff it out to a fairly good shine. This was good news for me because I had at least done this before. Only problem was I only had up to 1000 grit at the time so it would have to do. I practiced with different combinations of wet sanding with the 1000 grit and fine steel wool on my hammer handles. I could get more gloss out of the steel wool and polish than the wet sanding but I really loved the feel of the wet sanding. It did worlds to smooth out the, for lack of a better description, plastic feel of a fresh coat of polyurethane.\nThe second set of pictures show the result of my decision to wet sand everything outside with the 1000 grit. I used a solution of soap and water to lubricate the sand paper and just went by feel. The drag of the paper changes when its close. There were still some brush marks after the wet sand but I thought without the little air bubbles it actually looked kinda cool so I stopped. I then made a quick polish over the whole thing using the same solution and fine steel wool.\nAfter that, I used an automotive polishing compound on an old sock to buff out the dullness. Old socks make the best polishing pads.\nFinally, I applied a coat of paste wax and then stared at it for awhile. The last set of pictures show the finish I settled on after all this nonsense.

The raw inside would be fine if it was just a box but it seemed a bit rough to just toss your nice shades in and have them come out looking worse than when they went in.\nThe plan here was to line this thing with a thin cloth in hopes of softening the texture and thereby reducing the propensity to scratching. Anytime you can reduce the propensity to scratching, you should do it.\nWith that solid logic, I had never done anything like this before. By this, I mean gluing fabric that is a custom fit to the inside of a box. I decided that the best way to attempt to work with cloth was to make a pattern. Because otherwise it'd just be a case with a handkerchief inside.\nTo make this I basically just took scratch paper and lined it up to the edges I wanted it to fit, made a small crease in it and then cut a section that wide. Once I had it \"ripped\" to width, I set it in place and creased the long edge. Now having that mark, I cut above it about an 1/8\". My theory here is that I'm going to glue the whole thing in there and then once dry, I'll remove the excess with a razorblade or something to trim it flush. This will make any mistakes I made in the pattern or irregularities in the surface below be able to actually be covered up because I will have enough material to do so.\nThe end pieces were a little difficult to replicate with the crease and cut method because of all the angles going on but I got there. Luckily, most of the end pieces were really close to the same so I could just cut multiples out of them once I had one made.\nAfter all the pieces were cut I just lined up the pieces and scotch taped them together.

Underpants??! At a time like this??\nWell, yes. Underpants. Fancy looking ones. My mother had a whole box of these. They were my Grandpa's on my mom's side of the family. He is now deceased. I think she was saving them to make something out of them because she's kind of weird like that. Can you imagine? An underpants quilt?\nDon't get squeamish on me. I believe this lot was a bunch of new ones he had. Even if I'm mistaken, they're probably at least washed...\nHaha, well anyway, she hasn't done anything with them yet. When she wasn't looking I grabbed a pair.\nWhy underpants? I'll tell you why. The cloth is thin, and soft. Plus that pattern is killer. Where else can you find cool cloth like that? The price was right, although not even really a factor. There is a sense of nostalgia in using this cloth seeing as they had something to do with my Grandpa. I figured even if she hadn't done anything with this material yet, that doesn't mean it should go to waste. Even if the outcome is a bit disturbing.\nJust to play it safe, I cut a big square of material out of the outside of the hip area to get the furthermost region of cloth in relation to...well... you know.\nFrom there I taped my patterns to the cloth where I wanted the designs to come through and just cut them out. It was really that simple. When I got both of them cut out, I did a dry run test fit just to make sure that the whole pattern thing actually worked.

I got everything masked off great, followed the directions to the tee but I made two fatal mistakes.\nThe first mistake was thinking this thing was still wood and testing it like it was a bare wood and cloth adhesion. This thing is coated in three coats of polyurethane now so its basically plastic on the surface.\nThe second mistake was leaving the masking paper on there past the \"tack\" stage so that when I went to peel it off and start sticking my cloth to it, the whole amount of glue just came with the masking tape, essentially. It's like in the movies when the bad guy has a prosthetic mask on and they peel it off.\nI just rolled with the failure and used a big ball of the glue to get the rest of it out of there and it basically all came out like it was never even there.

This glue was really only good for fabric to fabric type bonds.\nAccepting that all glues are not created equal, I went and bought some of the highest quality spray adhesive I could find. One that was rated for a plastic to fabric bond. Treating this now like a piece of plastic, I sanded the entire interior with 100 grit sandpaper until it was foggy in appearance. I made sure there were no slick spots but was also careful to not sand too much. I wanted this thing to have a 360 finish to make sure the wood is sealed in.\nWith that done, I re-masked the whole setup again because that worked slick. If you're curious about my masking setup, I just flipped the cases open sided down on some paper and traced around them. I just cut the traced section out and then masked the sides of the case with wide tape. This allowed me to bring the paper up around the case to the masking tape overhang and stick it. In this way I completely removed any chance of spray adhesive getting all over my semi awesome finish job.\nAssured it was all protected, I sprayed the adhesive leaving a good uniform coat on all the surfaces. I let it tack up for about 15 seconds and then promptly removed the masking setup. I let it tack up longer until it stuck to my knuckle but didn't get removed from the surface.\nThis new adhesive was seriously tacky stuff and I'm so glad I messed up the first try. It was so tacky, however, that I got scared I wasn't going to be able to get the pattern in there and move it around very much. I taped in the sides of the cloth so I only had the front and the back to worry about sticking to the sides and holding me up when trying to align the bottom.\nI managed to get both sides done. Sorry I didn't have any pictures of that process but just imagine everything sticking to everything. It wasn't quite a nightmare, but it was close. Patience is the key, but you still have to work quickly enough to beat the dry time. I ended up lucking out on the initial placement of the material and then used my fingers and finally a flat bladed screwdriver to carefully work the material into the corners.

The cloth still felt soft on the glued areas too so I was pretty stoked on that.\nThere are a few tricks I can share for this next step that I learned by doing it. First of all, grab a brand new razorblade/boxcutter/xacto knife blade. Trust me. Don't even try the blade you have in there right now. Its not sharp enough to cut without fraying the material.\nGrab the excess and with the knife, cut slow, short, light cuts from the inside of the case to the outside. This keeps the material tight to the glued surface while you're trimming. With the cloth tight to the glue, it has a really tough time fraying.\nI got a few frays but I just kept trimming until they were all but gone. I kept running my fingers over the edge of the case. If it produced a fray, I'd keep trimming. Eventually, I think I produced a pretty smooth cut that was just under the edge of the wood.\nAt this point, I was pretty much done.

By smacking the chisel in between plank and rail, you can usually separate the two without splitting the plank. It rips the nails out very nicely.\nYou can use crowbars, but they are narrower and apply pressure too locally. Crowbarring can split a board, if one side of the board is free to move, but the other is still attached.\nI have to say, it is not common to find decent hardwood on pallet - Most pallets are sotwood (in fact the chisel technique is shown here on a softwood pallet, but it is as effective on hardwood)\nThis pallet was from a skip outside the local fireplace shop. I assume they use hardwood pallets for strength, as they ahve to bear the heavy stuff they sell, like cast-iron fireplaces and heavy marble slabs that they use for decorative surrounds.

The router section is also enclosed to provide dust collection and to reduce router noise.\nThis Instructable shows you the specifics concerning how I modified my portable Delta contractor table saw. Since table saws vary in construction details, you will need to modify the construction approach as necessary for your table saw.\nMy inspiration for this tool came from Tom Clark's \"Practical Shop Cabinets\" (pages 36-41). He describes how to build a hinged top stand-alone router table with dust collection. I modified Tom's design for my table saw.\nTom had several design requirements for his table, including:\n1) Smooth lid\n2) Hinged top to enable easy access for router bit replacement & adjustment\n3) Built-in dust collector\nTo which I added the following requirements:\n4) the router table had to fit as an extension table to my table saw\n5) easy removal of the router for other uses if needed\nI have just put the router table into service and it appears to meet all of the above requirements.

It took me a few cans to figure out which one would work best (I used a stain called \"Special Walnut\"). This is where your offcuts come in handy, as you can stain them and get a pretty good idea what your handle will look like.\nFirst, I used a product called a \"stain conditioner\" on the handle of the knife. Pine, because it's a softwood, can be a little difficult to stain with a good color. This is because the wood has a loose grain that will suck up the stain really easily, giving you darker colors than you may want. A stain conditioner will block up some of the pores in the wood, making the stain lighter and more even. However, if you used a more tightly grained wood, or a different stain, you may not need this stain conditioner (despite what Minwax will tell you).\nIn hindsight, I would have done this before the painting, because the paint will cover up any stain that overlaps onto the blade. Also, I had to touch up the paint in places where the stain didn't quite meet up with the edge of the paint, leaving ugly bare spots.\nAfter both the paint and stain were done, I gave the whole thing a single coat of polyurethane.\nAnd, again, you could stop here and you would have a very nice looking prop.

If you don't have such skill in knotwork, or you don't think you want to go through the effort, you can skip this step.\nI started by tying a turk's head knot (also known as a \"woggle\") around the hilt of the blade. I won't go over the details of tying this knot here, but you can find plenty of instructables and youtube videos on the subject that can probably explain it much better than I can.\nThe one thing to keep in mind when tying it with the leather cord is to keep the leather cord un-twisted. Unlike paracord, the leather cord is flat and can have a tendency to twist as you tie. Prevent this as well as you can, as you will have to go in later and work those twists through the whole knot, or at least hide them in places they wont be seen.\nI like to tie the knot on my hand and periodically pushed it onto the blade at the position I wanted it at to keep it the necessary size. After the knot was tied, I used some 'leather cement' to keep it in place on the blade. If you don't have this, regular glue, epoxy, or superglue might work just as well.

However, here are a few photos to show you what the end result would generally look like\nIf you want to do this, after the Turk's Head knot is fully tied, work a bit of slack through from one side to the other to help even the remaining cord to each side a bit. Also, when finished with the Turk's Head Knot, make sure each end is coming out below the knot on the same side.

There are certainly better tools out there, but these are probably among the most common, the cheapest to own, and the easiest to use that you will find.\nJigsaw --- I recommend using a blade with a higher tooth count (10-12 TPI) and straight teeth as opposed to the stock blade. The stock blade is intended for general purpose rough cuts and does not produce the highest quality edges. I knew this, ignored it, and the edges of my pieces suffered. Don\u2019t be like me. Buy the correct blade and do it right!\nDrill --- 3/8\u201d bit + another to be determined based on your jigsaw blade. We will be drilling holes to create the \u201cdogbones\u201d you typically see in flatpack pieces. Choose a bit that is slightly wider than your jigsaw blade. This will allow you to make those tough inside cuts.

Before we dive in I would like to address some general items and design components that you will encounter.\nThere are four components that make up this design (legs, seat, frame, and compression plate) and dimensioned drawings are included for each. If you feel comfortable reading and translating these into marks on your sheet, go for it. However, for those of you who need some additional guidance, I have also included some excruciatingly detailed instructions explaining how I went about making each mark.\nIf you download the attached design files (included in the individual steps) you will notice that they are comprised of many layers. Each layer represents a unique portion of the design (grid marks, detailed marks, cut lines, mandatory holes, optional holes, etc.) and selectively turning them on/off in your viewing program will allow you to focus in on specific information as it is presented. I encourage you to take advantage of it. My drafting instructors would be so proud\u2026\nThe little holes in the corners of some joints are referred to as dogbones. They are required because it is impossible to make an inside 90-degree cut in certain scenarios. Scenario 1 would be on a CNC machine, whose round bit can\u2019t cut a square inside corner (outside is possible). Scenario 2 would be a saw trying to cut an interior, rectangular slot. You can make the cut by going in at an angle and slowly clearing away the back edge but this is messy and time consuming. In either scenario, the dogbone effectively takes the corner away, providing clearance for the blade/bit and ensuring that we get square edges.\nIn the case of this project, it is possible to cut some inside 90-degree corners without using a dogbone. Being able to do so depends on the sequence in which you cut components out and your tolerance for simultaneously handling/sawing small pieces. These holes are marked as \u201coptional\u201d and you can include/exclude them as you desire.\nFinally, precise marks and general organization will make or break you in this project. The old adage, \u201cmark twice, cut once,\u201d definitely applies here. Labeling parts, double-checking alignments, taking advantage of symmetry between parts, and shading cutout areas to distinguish them against a busy background of marks all go a long way to help out.

The product of this was parts sharing several common dimensions, making use of existing edges, sharing edges, and laying neatly on a base grid.\nTo take full advantage of this, you need to go ahead and draw a grid of your own. Each square needs to be 4\u201d x 4\u201d. For all you non-math types, that means that on a 2\u2019x4\u2019 sheet you will have a 6 x 12 grid with 72 total squares.\nRequired areas (in 4\u201d grid spaces) for pieces are as follows:\nSeat \u20133 x 3 --- Qty 2\nLeg \u20131 x 5 --- Qty 6\nFrame \u2013 2 x 1 + some change --- Qty 6 --- the key on the top of the frame piece will extend outside of this area. Fortunately, we have ample space to accommodate this.\nCompression Plate = 2 x 2 --- Qty 2 --- this is conservative. We\u2019ll use the extra room to account for the extra areas in the frames above.\nIn case you weren\u2019t counting, that means we\u2019ll have about 4 squares (64 sq.in.) leftover. Yay! Scraps for another project!\nFeel free to play around with different configurations on your own, but I think that the best way arrange them is with the seat on one end, the frames and tension plates on the opposite end, and the legs in the middle. This divides the sheet \u201chot dog style\u201d with one stool per vertical half of the sheet. This arrangement also eliminates several cuts by taking full advantage of straight edges placed along the edge of the sheet of plywood.\nThis grid and the general arrangement outlined above will make your life much easier in the upcoming steps as we detail each component.

They will also need to slotted to connect to the frame piece, notched to seat the compression plate, and eared to clear the carriage bolt. Let\u2019s get to it.\nStart in the top corner of the leg and use your protractor to draw a 10-degree angle across the width of the piece. This will form the angle at which the leg contacts the bottom of the seat.\nMeasuring from the top corner and along the length of the leg, place marks at 2\u201d and 7-1/2\u201d (relative to the corner). Repeat this process on the opposite side relative to the point at which the 10-degree angle line you drew in Step #1 intersects the edge of the leg. Connect each set of points using your ruler to create parallel lines at a 10-degree angle.\nMeasuring from the point where the original 10-degree line you drew intersects the edge of the leg, and along the 10-degree line. Make a mark at 1-1/2\u201d and at 2-1/4\u201d (3/4\u201d between).\nDraw a line through these points, perpendicular to the original 10-degree angle line, and intersecting the 10-degree angle line drawn at the 2\u201d mark. This will form the slot for attaching to the frame.\nParallel to the slot, in the top corner, draw a perpendicular line passing through the point where the the 10-degree line at 2\u201d intersects the side of the leg. This ear will provide the necessary clearance for the carriage bolt to pass between the legs.\nOn the same side, measure 1/2\u201d along the 7-1/2\u201d offset 10-degree line. Draw a perpendicular line running through this point and toward the side of the leg. This line shoud be parallel to the frame slot and the ear you just marked. This notch will provide a flat seat in which the compression plate can seat and pull the assembly together.\nThere are two required dogbone holes at the bottom of the slot. A third, optional dogbone hole is at the corner of the notch further down the leg.\nFinally, use your compass or a round object to draw a radius (> 2\u201d) at the bottom of the leg. Alternatively, you can make a flat bottomed leg by drawing another 10-degree line through the bottom corner, and parallel to the other lines you just drew.\nPRO-TIP: If you mirror pairs of legs then you can reuse the 0\u201d, 2\u201d, and 7-1/2\u201d offsets, reducing the marking time significantly, and better ensuring things align properly.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FN4/DLY8/IO25C84R/FN4DLY8IO25C84R.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEZ/FPIL/IO25BZUR/FEZFPILIO25BZUR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUM/IG95/IO25BYVU/FUMIG95IO25BYVU.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZ6/R11Q/IO25C9K2/FZ6R11QIO25C9K2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FY4/FS4X/IO25C8HJ/FY4FS4XIO25C8HJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Marking: Legs"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "The frames are perhaps the easiest component to mark since the make use of the most basic geometries. Precision is key however, as they provide the foundation for much of the assembly.\nBegin by dividing the 2x1 grid area in half, vertically. This will form the top of the slot and the bottoms of the notches that allow the frame to connect to its twin siblings.\nNext, use your ruler to mark 1\u201d from the edges of the piece, forming two 1\u201d x 2\u201d rectangles in opposite corners of the piece. These notches are where the frame pieces will interconnect later.\nFinish marking the 2\u201d deep leg attachment slot by centering a 0.75\u201d x 2\u201d rectangle, oriented vertically, on the bottom edge. You can draw this by marking a 3/8\u201d offset on either side of the main gridline dividing the piece in half, or by measuring 3-5/8\u201d from the left or right edge.\nTo mark the top key by which the frame inserts into the seat, draw a horizontal line \u00be\u201d above the top of the piece (4-3/4\u201d from the base). Draw the sides of the key by placing a mark offset 1\u201d from the centerline, or 3\u201d from the edge on either side.\nMuch like the legs, dogbone holes are required in the slot, but are optional everywhere else.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FEX/HZAP/IO25C9AF/FEXHZAPIO25C9AF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F2O/YHCY/IO25C0DV/F2OYHCYIO25C0DV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F5L/FTPE/IO25C978/F5LFTPEIO25C978.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIX/WRQ9/IO25C7OQ/FIXWRQ9IO25C7OQ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F98/TA1Z/IO25C9DO/F98TA1ZIO25C9DO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 7: Marking: Frames"}, {"step": 8, "steps_text": "The compression plate is the piece that literally holds everything together. Its base shape is an equilateral triangle, and marking it is simpler than you think.\nStart at the base of a 2 x 2 grid, and adjust your compass to a diameter of 8\u201d (across two grid squares). This will be the bottom side of your triangle and the endpoints of this segment will be two of its three vertices. Place the point of the compass on either of the vertices and draw an arc intersecting the centerline of the 2 x 2 grid. Technically, this intersection point is the third vertex of the triangle, but go ahead and repeat the process on the opposite side to verify.\nConnect the bottom vertices to the top one using your ruler and the equilateral triangle is complete!\nThe plate will be slotted where it mates with each leg. Each slot will be \u00bd\u201d deep and \u00be\u201d wide to match the width of the leg. To get the placement for each one, start by finding the midpoint of each side of the triangle (hint: one side is already done).\nDraw a line intersecting this midpoint and the vertex opposite it. Your slots need to be centered on these lines.\nMark the \u00bd\u201d depth along the perpendicular bisector lines you just drew.\nThen draw parallel lines at 3/8\u201d off both sides to finish out the slot. Each of these slots will have two dogbone holes since they are interior corners.\nThe point where all of the perpendicular bisectors meet is the center of your triangle. It is also the precise location where you will need to drill a 3/8\u201d diameter hole for the threaded end of the carriage bolt to slide through. Mark it accordingly.\nFinally, for aesthetics and so a pointy triangle doesn\u2019t poke you in the leg while you are using your stool, we\u2019ll round off the corners of the triangle. I used the same 4+ inch round container to mark mine. Any round object, or your compass will do the job though.

That meant that getting it right was critical to ensure I didn\u2019t end up with a loose, sloppy, poorly fitting mess.\nWe\u2019ll start with the easy part; rounding out the corners. Pick up your favorite round object or compass again and mark some radii. You could also make a circular seat if that suits you better. I chose a square seat because\u2026well I don\u2019t know. It just looked cool!\nNext, find the center of the seat by drawing the diagonals of the 3 x 3 square. The hole for the top of the carriage bolt will go here.\nNow, you may have noticed, the top of your carriage bolt is square! This allows it to be tightened despite its round head. Surely you\u2019ve heard the saying, \u201cyou can\u2019t fit a square peg in a round hole.\u201d This is that in real life!!! I\u2019ve got a simple solution to fix this later, so for now just make a mark for a 3/8\u201d hole.\nThe challenging part is locating the three keys that attach the frame to the seat. When assembled together, the inside edges of the three frame pieces will form a 6\u201d equilateral triangle. We need a 6\u201d equilateral triangle, STAT!!! Geometry to the rescue, yet again!\nI experimented with a few methods, but by far the easiest is to separately draw your own equilateral triangle and transfer the necessary dimensions to the seat.\nTo start, bust out your ruler and a sheet of paper and draw a 6\u201d line segment.\nUsing the same technique that you used to mark the triangle for the compression plate, find the third vertex of the triangle (Recall: 6\u201d radius arc from each vertex, do it for both sides, 3rd point is where they intersect).\nDraw in the sides to complete it.\nJust like you did for the compression plate, find the midpoint of each side and draw the perpendicular bisectors to reveal the circumcenter of the triangle.\nPlace one end of your compass on the circumcenter of the triangle and the other end on any of the three vertices. Transfer the compass over to the seat template and draw a complete circle with its center at the center of the seat. Choose any of the four points at which this circle intersects the diagonals. This is vertex #1.\nGo back to your sheet of paper and set the radius of your compass at 6\u201d. Now transfer it back to the seat template and draw a 6\u201d radius arc with its center at the vertex you drew in the last step. The final two vertices are located where the circle you drew in the last step intersects this arc.\nConnect the vertices to form the sides. Your 6\u201d equilateral triangle is complete!\nFind the perpendicular bisector of each side by marking the midpoint and connecting it to the vertex on the opposite side.\nThe process for marking the holes is also exactly the same as it was for the compression plate (centered on the bisectors you just marked). However, in this case the holes go outside of the triangle and their dimensions are 3/4\u201d x 2\u201d. Each one gets a set of 4 lovely dogbones as well. Fido is drooling right now\u2026\nAnd with that you are done marking!!!! Thank goodness!!!!

In my case, I use water to cool a pair of high current electromagnetic coils. The cooling pipes have a fixed size that cannot be increased. By boosting the water pressure, I can increase the flow of water through the pipes and thus I directly increase the power capacity of my system. Higher pressure can also be useful for better cooling any electrical or heat generating system, for getting water to go a long way uphill, or for stronger spray jets in irrigation or showers. If you are interested in boosting your home water pressure, there are a lot of plumbing considerations that will be relevant for you which I don't know about and don't go into here.\nIn this instructable, I use a 3/4 horse power pump from Flotec, but I will also discuss pump selection more generally. It is distributed by Northern Tool, among others. This is a specific kind of water pump designed to give a large pressure increase by stacking multiple compression stages one after the other. Multi-stage pressure boosting water pumps typically deliver 100-200 psi above inlet pressure, and several can be placed in series, provided the total pressure doesn't exceed their rated \"maximum total pressure\", in this case 315 psi. By comparison, other centrifugal pumps deliver great flow rates, but don't usually increase the pressure by these amounts. For example, this pump from Star Water Systems provides 4500 GPH (eight times the Flotec) but only 48 psi. For really high pressures, linear piston based designs are more common. This piston pump provides 1000 psi for example at 180 GPH, and this one can hit the 10,000 psi mark.\nIf you're looking for pressure boosts of a factor of 2-4 for flow rates below 1000 GPH, you may be able to use a pump very similar to the one I used, but even if you're not sure what you need yet, this instructable should help you decide that as well.", "title": "Water Pressure Boosting System", "url": "https://www.instructables.com/id/Water-Pressure-Boosting-System/", "steps": [{"step": 1, "steps_text": "Figure out what your flow rate will be. Do this by setting up your apparatus sans booster pump, and emptying into a 5 gallon bucket instead of your return or drain. Turn on at a known pressure. (There should be a gauge somewhere to tell you your building pressure. Mine is 52psi. If not, connect a gauge near where the pump will attach). Now measure the time it takes to fill in seconds. Five divided by this is your flow rate in gallons per second, and multiply by 60 to get gallons per minute or by 3600 to get gallons per hour.\n\nNow, if your apparatus doesn't suffer from turbulence then the flow rate after boosting will scale with pressure. The Reynolds number can tell you this, provided you've also avoided right angle turns, choke points, or other flow impediments. Re = 10^6 * dh / v, where v is the velocity in m/s that you can get based on the flow rate you calculated, dh is the hydraulic diameter (normal diameter for a round pipe, side length for a square) in meters, and the factor of a million comes from the kinematic viscosity of water at 20 degC. Note that this actually changes significantly with temperature however. If Re is below 2300, you are in the laminar regime, where flow is non-turbulent, and flow rate scales linearly with pressure. If your flow isn't laminar, pressure boosting is probably not the right strategy for your application. On the other hand, if the booster isn't pushing you close to turbulent, then you can probably make further gains with a bigger boost.\nIn my case, I get the following:\nvolume flow = 0.125 GPM at 60psi,\ndh = 3mm\nA = 9mm^2 (pipe area)\nv = 0.125 GPM * 1min/60sec * 4L/gal * 1m^3/1000L / 9mm^2 *1,000,000mm^2/m^2 = 1.9 m/s.\nRe = 1,000,000 * 0.003 / 1.9 = 790 < 2300, laminar.\nWith the booster, pressure goes to 210psi, so Re goes to 2700, the transition region, possibly turbulent, but close enough that its probably okay.\nI'm heating the water a lot (70C), so Re will go up by another factor of 2.5 and I will definitely have turbulence near the outlet of my coils. So I probably won't get a pure scaling of flow rate, and a larger pressure boost probably won't help more.\nA note about units- I prefer to work with psi, pounds per square inch. An atmosphere (100 kPa, 760 Torr, 1 bar, 30 inHg) is about 13 psi. For water pumps, some prefer \"feet of head\" which literally tells you how high uphill you can run a pipe before the water pressure drops to zero and the flow ceases. For Mercury, which is a metal liquid 13.5 times as dense as water, one atmosphere only pushes 30 inches or 760 mm uphill. For water, you guessed it, an atmosphere pushes 13.5 times as far, or 34 ft. This means that if you had a 35 ft straw and you tried to put your finger on the top and lift it out of the ocean, the top foot closest to your finger would be under vacuum, and the water would only rise the first 34 ft. Unless you live at altitude like me. In boulder it would rise 31 ft. Anyway the upshot is that pumps also come rated for \"feet of head\", of which there are 2.3 for every psi. Here's a handy converter.\nA note about power: pressure times volume flow gives units of power, since pressure times volume gives energy and energy per second is power. The units require a bunch of conversion, but it is possible to multiply the pressure gain and volume flow rate of a pump to get the power. If I do this for my 150 psi, 780 GPH pump, I find more horses than advertised:\n150psi * 10^5 Pascal / 13psi * 780 gph * 4 L/gal * 1 hr / 3600 s * 1m^3 / 1000L * 1 hp / 750 W = 1.33 hp.\nThis is because no pump can actually deliver maximum pressure boost at maximum flow rate. If we really want 780 gph, with 3/4 hp we can only get .75/1.33 * 150psi = 85 psi boost, but this neglects losses. Looking back at the specs I find the actual pressure boost at max flow: \"13GPM @ 70psi\" (13*60=780GPH) This is important to keep in mind for pump selection, which we'll get into more next.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FE6/E4Z6/IO36J947/FE6E4Z6IO36J947.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0A/SZGE/IO4LWUQB/F0ASZGEIO4LWUQB.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Do the Math"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "The 3/4 hp model I chose from flotec allows me to boost by 150 psi and from 15 GPH to about 50 GPH. 1/2 hp and 1 hp models are also available, with pressure boosts of 110 psi and 190 psi respectively. There's plenty of other reasonable looking manufacturers, grainger has a nice list here. One thing to keep in mind is that these pumps can't be run at zero flow, because they rely on the water for cooling. I couldn't find a minimum flow rating for the flotec pump, but page 5 (bottom right) of its manual explains that in a spray nozzle application, nozzles must be \"weeping\" so that they provide flow when not spraying. I infer from this that the required minimum flow rate is rather small compared to the maximum flow, probably only a few percent. If your application requires much less than 50 GPH, you could consider adding a bypass pipe that gives the water another path from high pressure back to your drain to increase the flow rate through your pump. A long roll of 1/4\" PETE tube with 350psi rating should do the trick, its length can be tuned for any desired flow rate. As long as the flow allowed by the bypass stays below 10% or so of the pump's max flow, the pressure will not be substantially reduced. This means the flow along your desired path will not be reduced by the bypass.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FMC/QP0U/IO4LWQR1/FMCQP0UIO4LWQR1.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Select a Pump"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "The pump must be firmly mounted.

If you have access to 230, it's a better choice because the current will be lower. At 115 you may be close to 15 amps, (even with low water flow and thus low power draw, you'll get close to peak current at least when you first plug it in), potentially throwing your breaker or overheating wiring. If you have access to 120 volt three phase, you can make 230 volt 2 phase out of it just by connecting only two of the three phases. It will really be 208 volts, but that is normally close enough for most equipment. If you do this, make sure you cap off the unused phase and have no copper exposed when you turn it on.\nTo be more specific, lets say there is an outlet available in your building that looks beefier than normal and has a label saying 230 or 3phase. Go to mcmaster and find the corresponding plug. In my case it looks like this. Count the number of tabs. If there are three, than one is a ground and you have two phase power. If there are four, then one is a ground and you have three phase power. Now find cable with a low enough gauge for your current draw. You can strip the wire like normal and connect it to the plug with a screw driver. On the other end, strip and connect only two of the phases and ground as directed in your pump manual (page 6), and put a cap on the third phase. Now if your pump needs three phase but you have two, that's a different, more challenging story.\nIf you are using a larger model at 1 hp or above, you may need to have an electrician wire an outlet back to a breaker with a larger current limit. Typcial breakers stop at 20 or 30 amps.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FTD/XWO5/IO36J876/FTDXWO5IO36J876.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FEB/1FAX/IO36J8BV/FEB1FAXIO36J8BV.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Wiring"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Now for the actual business. Depending on which horsepower pump you choose, the inlet and outlet will have some NPT size that you will need to match. For my application, I chose to adapt to hose right away. This yields a less permanent installation, but with high enough pressure rated hose, it's no sacrifice of quality and can even be better than pipe for avoiding right angles or dissipating water hammer. Use an appropriately sized hose barb to mate to the pump. It should be male NPT threaded on the pump side with a size matching the pump. The 3/4 hp Flotec uses 3/4 size NPT. The other side is sized to the inner diameter of your tube.\nKeep pressure ratings in mind for everything. The brass fittings I used everywhere are good for 250 psi, but if you're going a bit higher, stainless steel will get you to 300 psi. Beyond this I don't think you'll find plastic tubing that can work anyway, so you'll have to do some more serious plumbing with actual metal pipes.\nA note on NPT threading. You'll need teflon pipe tape, and you need to wrap it in the right direction. If you didn't know about direction, that might explain some of the times you've tried to use teflon tape and it has still leaked. This how-to gets it right.\nThe electronic system that I cool with this system is a 300 Amp, 25 turn helmholtz coil suitable for generating 350 Gauss at the center of a 6\" cube vacuum chamber.

For this purpose I made a simple application from a random piece of timber of the right size, an old bicyle tube, a random screw, and a rather large washer. The bicyle tube is put through the didge and its end tied to something high at a wall or at the ceiling. The piece of wood holds the didge (it's like the didge is balancing on the wood). Make sure that both tube and piece of wood are strong, and the washer is large enough to securly seperate tube and screw. In my first experience I didn't use a washer at all and the screw slipped through its hole through the tube, and the didge fell to the ground. Not nice.\nSo, once your didge is hanging securely, you can use a paintbrush and layer the wood with the boiled linseed oil. Read the instructions on the linseed oil package, they will tell you exactly how long you have to wait until you can add a second layer, and probably a third.

Much to my surprise, the bowling alley floor was basically a butcher block nailed together. It was definitely wouldn't work as a desk top without some work; it was pretty floppy, uneven, and had large gaps between boards. In order to keep it rigid, someone had installed a piece of angle iron that was pretty rusted. It was too short and too deep to work for the desired top dimensions (30\" deep x 60\" wide), had missing pieces and a bunch of holes drilled in it.

You can see from the pictures, they're solid maple, about 3\" thick, with a profile cut into them to help align the parts. They were attached to each other with some pretty vintage construction adhesive, which was quite brittle and came apart fine, and some 3\" twist nails. You might think a 3\" nail shouldn't be hard to pull out, but I've only done that in pine, which is as soft as butter compared to this hard maple.

I hope your dreams don't wash up on the shores of reality.\nI used a bunch of epoxy, probably around 10 oz per glue up, mix it up at once, use a big disposable cup and a acid brush to mix and apply. I didn't take a lot of pictures during the glue up (something about the panic). I like west Systems epoxy, it's locally available in bulk for me. Don't get to showboating and use the fast hardener, make sure you're using a slow hardener.\nClamp it down good. This is the best shot you have of getting nice tight joints. You'll want to use clamps on both the top and bottom so you don't get un-even pressure and make a taco shape out of it.\nWait 24 hours for a good cure on the epoxy, then un-clamp it clean up all the epoxy drips that solidified on the bottom. I used a couple planes to clean it up. It doesn't have to be perfect, but you don't want it to be too rough or it won't feed into the planer well. I generally just made sure there were no big high spots on it.\nRepeat for the other half.\nNow, go get yourself a 15\" helical head planer. If you don't have one, it's really going to suck to smooth this all out with a hand plane - it's doable, but expect many hours and a full body workout. I've done it before, but the 3 hp planer does all the same work with better results in about 5 minutes of planing. It's amazing. Send it through, alternating sides until both are the same thickness and smooth.\nI had initially been worried that the bowling arrow marks on the floor would cause problems at this stage -- with all the grime on it, I couldn't tell if it was end grain, and there was always the worry that they wouldn't be that deep and I would remove them entirely with my planer. I lucked out big time, they were face grain walnut plugs, and they were at least as deep as the material I removed!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWM/AUZ8/IO1OWYVH/FWMAUZ8IO1OWYVH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYY/5064/IO1OWYVD/FYY5064IO1OWYVD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKT/5JKA/IO1OWYV6/FKT5JKAIO1OWYV6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGR/3I41/IO1OWYV1/FGR3I41IO1OWYV1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS1/KIT6/IO1OWYUT/FS1KIT6IO1OWYUT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F9H/JGDA/IO1OWYUS/F9HJGDAIO1OWYUS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRC/D7N4/IO1OWYUR/FRCD7N4IO1OWYUR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FX1/8IE4/IO1OWYUM/FX18IE4IO1OWYUM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS9/IR9A/IO1OWYUJ/FS9IR9AIO1OWYUJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Epoxy Everything Like Crazy, Then Clean It Up"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Now, you've got two giant and heavy chucks of maple.

I removed the raised portion on the edge in order to smooth it out. When I did the original glue up, the wood would flex enough to resolve some of these problems, but now that it's 14\" wide, there's no flex, so you gotta get it perfect. I usually set them vertically to see how the glue joint looks, mark areas that need work, plane, and repeat.\nOnce you've got the glue joint tight, I added some dominos in order to get things aligned correctly. You could also use biscuits, but dominos are much more rigid and align in two dimensions instead of just vertical. The dominos really don't add much strength, it's going to be more than strong enough with all that glue surface.\nNow glue it up, clamp away, but keep in mind nothing will be flexing, so you don't need quite as many clamps.

I decided to use 1 1/4\" pipe, as a nice balance between rigidity and weight. I also decided to thread my own pipe so I could really fine tune the final height. You could however buy all precut/threaded pipes, keep in mind the cost will be much higher.\nAs far as the design, you could try to make this without any lower supports, but I hate desks and tables that wobble. The cross supports give it nice support to keep it from racking under load. Also I put the rear cross support at the level that the user can put their feet up while sitting. You could also certainly modify this into a standing desk (permanently) if you want with longer legs.\nYou'll need a couple of tools to make this base.\n- Pipe threader ( I bought el cheapo from Northern tool that worked pretty decent for around $80, with six thread sizes)\n- Pipe Cutter (you can get by with a angle grinder or chop saw if you love sparks)\n- Thread cutting fluid\n- Pipe vise (I tried to make due with a hole drilled through some wood and my wood vises, but this didn't have enough bite to keep it from spinning.\n- Pipe Wrench (I tried to do without, but the final leveling would have been impossible without it).\nYou'll also need some pipe fittings\n- 6 x T-fittings\n- 4 x Floor flanges\n- 4 x Pipe caps\n- A bunch of pipe (I got it done with 2 x 10' lengths)\nI started by cutting all my pipe to length, I wanted to make sure I had a 2\" gap between the edge of the top and the edge of the floor flanges. So I set out all my floor flanges on the top in their desired positions, set the T-fittings on top, and measured the lengths of each pipe. Make sure to account for the amount of thread that will be left in the fittings. Take care to get the lengths equal for all the vertical pieces. I used a pipe cutter to cut them, since it was low noise/dust/spark and was pretty precise. Just get the tool set in the right place, tighten it down, and spin it around the pipe. Tighten it a quarter to a half turn each time you rotate it around the pipe. There's plenty of good youtube videos on this to help.\nWith the pipes cut, it's time to cut some threads. Doing this manually (no power threader) will take some time and some muscle. There's lots of good video's on how to cut threads as well, but my 3 tips would be, make sure you have a good way to clamp the pipe, use plenty of cutting fluid, and plan on it taking some time. At my best, I probably took about 5 minutes per thread if everything went well. I did buy two short lengths of pipe pre-threaded. They're the two 3\" pieces of pipe to join the rear leg cross support T-fittings. It was short enough that I wasn't sure I would have enough room to clamp and thread well. Keep in mind, I paid about $5 each, and a whole 10' length is only $21. That's why I didn't do more of them.\nAlso, as I put things together, do it in such a way that you can use other pipes to tighten everything up as you go. One nice freebie is that you can adjust it a little bit at the end by really cranking down on some pipes to get everything to sit level.\nOnce I had all the pipes cut, threaded, and assembled, I put them on my assembly table and did a final leveling. Then I flipped over the top, marked the screw holes, pre-drilled, and assembled with #14 flat head screws.\nI then sanded all the base down to get rid of any sharp metal from the pipe vise or pipe wrench. When I was happy with the entire base, I painted it all with flat black spray paint.\nOne final thing I noticed after the fact, by doing the legs the way I did, I could detach the top and rotate the outer legs in and make it a form of \"flat pack\" base. I usually don't ever make my furniture flat pack, because it almost always makes it weak and wobbly. This setup however kept it nice and rigid!\nThanks for looking.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F04/GE7G/IO1OWYW4/F04GE7GIO1OWYW4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRY/DCM5/IO1OWYOH/FRYDCM5IO1OWYOH.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FXS/TGPC/IO1OWYOL/FXSTGPCIO1OWYOL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWE/KCWZ/IO1OWYLC/FWEKCWZIO1OWYLC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FGA/RJQ7/IO1OWYLO/FGARJQ7IO1OWYLO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKN/LPSF/IO1OWYW8/FKNLPSFIO1OWYW8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJN/W2AB/IO1OWYIF/FJNW2ABIO1OWYIF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFU/H2S3/IO1OWYL9/FFUH2S3IO1OWYL9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FU9/GECE/IO1OWYI5/FU9GECEIO1OWYI5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FQ3/FBKM/IO1OWYL8/FQ3FBKMIO1OWYL8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYH/HK61/IO1OWYJT/FYHHK61IO1OWYJT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN2/491R/IO1OWYGM/FN2491RIO1OWYGM.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F35/36N4/IO1OWYDT/F3536N4IO1OWYDT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPR/0A7B/IO1OWYDS/FPR0A7BIO1OWYDS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FE3/CXFK/IO4JRRKJ/FE3CXFKIO4JRRKJ.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Make the Pipe Base"}], "channel": "Furniture"}, {"category": "Workshop", "description": "This was built in-situ and perpendicular to an existing woodshed which this one replicates to a degree with a few slight differences, 1. it is smaller\n2. has no dividing sections\n3. smaller post supports and less of a pitch on the roof\nThe client spec was that they wanted a wood storage and wood working area that would provide a bit of shelter\nfrom prevailing winds and be in keeping and sympathetic to the surrounding property and outbuildings as well as using as much locally sourced material, which is what I did apart from the screws, the post supports, rawl bolts and concrete.

You don't want your box to collapse on itself.\n- 1/4\" MDF - This is used to make the raised top of our box, as well as the frames that hold the sheets of plastic when forming.\n- Various screws and wood glue - You can complete this project with screws or glue alone, just as long as the sides of your box are air-tight. It's best to use a combination of the two.\n- Table saw or miter saw - Obviously for the woodworking aspect of the project. You can pretty much use any saw you have access to. Hand saw, band saw, jig saw, etc.\n- Drill or drill press - A drill press makes drilling all of the tiny holes in the top of the box much easier, but a regular hand drill works just fine.\n- Shop vac - This will be our vacuum source.

In this case, I used .06\" white styrene sheets that I purchased from Amazon.\n- Thick gloves - This particular setup is very hands-on, meaning you'll be handling hot materials, so you need gloves that will protect your hands from the heat.", "step_imgs": [], "step_title": "Step 1: Tools and Materials"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "While the process remains virtually the same no matter what you're forming, there are a couple different vacuum and heating elements that can be utilized.. We're going to be using the most basic setup for both.\nFirst of all, we're going to make our vacuum forming box. At it's core, our setup is literally just a box with lots of tiny holes in the top and one large hole in the side. The large hole in the side is where our shop vac is going to attach, while the top of the box is where all of the magic will happen.\nBefore we begin, you need to determine what size you want to make your box. A good rule is to take the widest portion of the thing you're making copies of and add a couple inches to it. This gives your plastic sheet enough space around the part when it's forming to fully conform to your part before the plastic cools.\nAfter you've determined the size, you need to start cutting your parts. The parts breakdown goes like this -\n- A top and bottom of equal size made from plywood\n- Four sides of equal size made from plywood\n- One riser layer an inch or so smaller than the top of your box\nAfter you've cut all of your parts, assemble the sides, top, and bottom using wood glue. I just used simple butt joints on all of the pieces because it was quick and easy. When everything is glued up, these joints are more than sturdy enough to withstand the force of the vacuum. To cut down on waiting time, I used my brad nailer to hold the pieces together while they dried so I could move on to the other steps of the project. You could also use screws, but be sure to pre-drill your holes to avoid splitting the wood.\nOnce the box is assembled, center your MDF riser on the top and glue it in place.\nNext, lay out a grid of 1/2\" squares on the MDF riser. This will be the guide for drilling your holes. Depending on the size of your box, you may need to adjust the size and spacing of your holes. The drill bit I used was 1/8\", but smaller holes are better, so I'd aim for 1/16\" or smaller.\nThe next step after drilling the holes in the top of your box is to drill the hole in the side for the hose on your shop vac. You want the hose to fit snugly in the hole, so trace the end of your hose onto one of the sides of your box and drill lots of holes inside the perimeter of the circle. Knock out the center and smooth down the sides of the hole with a file or coarse sandpaper. If you have a forstner bit or a hole saw that is the exact diameter of your vacuum hose, this step goes a lot faster.\nThe last step is to hook up your vacuum and turn it on. If you can feel air being pulled through the holes in the top of your box, that means it works!

Ideally this would be made from aluminum, but we'll be using 1/4\" MDF because that's what was readily available.\nThe frame is really straight-forward. You want to cut two pieces of MDF that are the same size, or slightly bigger, than the top of your box. Not the MDF riser, but the 1/2\" plywood top. Trace a square slightly bigger than the raised MDF riser on the center of your two pieces. It's critical that this frame be able to easily slip around the riser so that you get a good seal between the plastic and the box.\nIn the video, you'll see that my first attempt at cutting out the inside of the frame was a disaster. The MDF couldn't handle the force of the jigsaw and broke apart. If you have a scroll saw or a coping saw, you'll easily be able to cut the center out with no fear of destroying the frame. A jigsaw will probably work if you have a smaller blade.\nAlternatively, you can use the second method that I tried in the video and cut strips of MDF and butt the ends together to form your frame. In the long run, this won't be as sturdy as a solid piece, but it does get the job done.\nWhen it comes to clamping your plastic sheet between the two frame pieces, you have a couple options. The way that I went about was just to drill and countersink holes all along the frame for screws. The screws go through the first half of the frame, through the plastic sheet, and finally through the second half of the frame, clamping everything tightly. An alternative method is to just use binder clips all around the edges of your frame. They're cheap, easy to apply and remove, and will withstand the heat of your oven.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FLN/DDKY/IO4JR6A2/FLNDDKYIO4JR6A2.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3X/BC7X/IO4JR6AK/F3XBC7XIO4JR6AK.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FFS/TS1T/IO4JR6BS/FFSTS1TIO4JR6BS.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: The Plastic Frame"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Once you've finished your box and your frame, you're ready to go! I should say that whatever you're trying to make copies of should be able to support itself under vacuum and be able to withstand the heat of the plastic. MDF, solid wood, tooling foam, resin, and plaster are all common materials that people use for their masters. You want something solid. Things like EVA foam and clay aren't very good materials to use with vacuum forming because they will warp and distort with the heat and pressure, rendering your part useless.\nThrow on your gloves and preheat your oven because it's time to vacuum form something! Make sure that your plastic is tightly secured in your frame and put it in your oven. Start at a low temperature, around 250 - 300 and don't take your eyes off of the plastic. Once it starts to heat up, you'll see the surface start to ripple. After a couple seconds of that, it will smooth back out and start to sag in the middle. Quickly remove the frame from the oven and give the bottom of the soft plastic a tap. If it's floppy enough to slump back to it's saggy shape, you're ready to go. If it takes a second for it to slump back down, put it back in the oven for a few more seconds. Note the soft look of the first attempt in the pictures. This happened because the plastic wasn't hot enough.\nHere comes the part where I tell you that the process is just a lot of experimenting with your oven. It's not really an exact science. It depends on the size of your oven, how close the plastic is sitting from the heating elements, etc. The main thing is to start slow. If you heat your plastic too fast, the surface finish of the formed part will come out bumpy, kind of like the orange peel effect from a bad spray paint job.\nOnce you feel that the plastic is ready to go, take it out of the oven and place it over your master, making sure to press it as firmly as possible so you get a good seal. You only have a few seconds before it's starts cooling to the point where all of your details will become soft, so quickly turn on your vacuum. If everything was done right, you should see that plastic be sucked down onto your master. You have another couple seconds at this point to use your fingers to manipulate any areas that didn't quite get suck all the way down. Leave your vacuum on for a few more seconds and you're done.\nOnce your plastic is cool, you can remove it from the frame. More often than not, your master will be stuck in the newly formed part. Wiggly the plastic until your part pops out. You can make this process easier by making sure your master doesn't have any undercuts, as the plastic will encase it, meaning you'll have to cut it out. Sprinkling some talcum powder on your master before vacuum forming will also help.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FS4/MFS5/IO4JR6IB/FS4MFS5IO4JR6IB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FRW/EGSR/IO4JR6IV/FRWEGSRIO4JR6IV.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNV/QJVH/IO4JR6LW/FNVQJVHIO4JR6LW.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBQ/XG31/IO4JR6MO/FBQXG31IO4JR6MO.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSZ/BOIU/IO4JR6MY/FSZBOIUIO4JR6MY.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Let's Get Forming"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Congratulations!

Some method of keeping the battery door securely in place but allowing it to be easily opened for accessing the battery for charging. Not only this but I wanted to keep it as simple to print and as robust as possible! A tough task to accomplish with a latch or mechanism... So It thought more simply.\nI thought of just having a flat panel with a slight raised inner rectangle as the battery door as you can see. I designed two sturdy lugs on either side of the case where the battery door goes (as you can see in the screenshots) to allow a strong loop of rubber to secure the battery lid in place. Unfortunately I wanted to use a loop of black ninja flex filament to match the black aesthetic for this but I had run out at the time. So to demonstrate the principal I have used a normal elastic band which is extremely secure. I can properly shake the torch a lot ant it doesn't move at all.\nOf course this isn't necessarily the most elegant solution but it suited my design criteria for being simple (not only in function but print-ability) and effective.\nI would love your feedback in the comments about this design choice!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FWC/4IVL/IO0GEGR9/FWC4IVLIO0GEGR9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FBR/R5V4/IO0GF4JN/FBRR5V4IO0GF4JN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNN/7EIO/IO0GELM8/FNN7EIOIO0GELM8.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: Battery Door Design"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "This was the final printed part to design and it was fairly simple.

I attached said cone to a flat plate that could be mounted to the front of the case.\nI think this a good solution a you could print different attachments of different angles to produce any angle of beam you wanted.

I would suggest watching videos from Jimmy DiResta or Brent Bailey Forge. Both are amazing makers and excellent at giving you invaluable tips.\nYou can also buy some quality handles online or from the local hardware store. There are a couple things to know about hammer handles if you chose to buy them.\nFirst, you'll need to find a handle roughly the same length as the hammer originally had. Make sure and measure the entire length of the handle, including the part that goes into the eye.\nSecond, you'll need to pick the right type of handle shape for the hammer's eye. There are two basic shapes: square (usually used for for claw hammers) and oval (for mallets, sledges, etc.).\nThird, you'll need a wooden and metal wedge that are the appropriate size for the handle and hammer head eye opening (i.e. the wooden wedge needs to be wide enough to fill the entire length of the slot cut into the wooden handle). Most online or store hammer handles come with a sized handle and wedge set. Check this before you buy. Cost for the handle and wedges range from $4 to $9. If you decide to make your own handle or your purchased handle does not come with a wedge set, you can buy a set of those as well. Wooden wedges come in different sizes, as do metal wedges, but metal wedges also come in flat or circle shape. Flat wedges are driven in perpendicularly to the wooden wedge, while circular metal wedges are driven in the middle of the eye.\nUsing the piece of the old wood you removed from inside the hammer head eye, mark up the new wood handle with a pencil for a close approximation of the wood you need to remove for a tight fit. Go slow. Remove a little at a time, checking hammer head fit frequently. As my old barber used to say, \"I can always take more off, but I can't put it back on.\" I used a rasp, but others I've watched used a draw knife, spoke shave or band saw. You want a snug fit. Make sure the hammer head sits squarely on the handle with the wood coming all the way through the eye.\nAlthough you don't have to, this is a good time to sand off the thick clear coat that comes on the purchased wooden handles.\nNow you are ready to drive the wooden wedge into the handle slot. With the hammer head snuggly on and while holding the hammer handle in your hand (not resting against a bench), drive the wooden wedge into the slot until it will go no further. Turn the hammer 180 degrees between hits. If you try doing this step with the handle on a solid surface, the wooden wedge will likely break. Next, do the same with the metal wedge. Perpendicular to the wooden wedge if metal wedge is flat. In the middle of the eye, if the metal wedge is circular.\nEither cut off or grind off any extra wood and wedge material sticking out of the top of the eye and apply Wonderlokking glue to the wood in the eye to swell it and seal it.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVA/YGZV/IO34BM0U/FVAYGZVIO34BM0U.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAK/TMQE/IO34C08Y/FAKTMQEIO34C08Y.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNN/B06O/IO34BM1Z/FNNB06OIO34BM1Z.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS7/UBYT/IO34C64K/FS7UBYTIO34C64K.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8S/L4NI/IO34BHBS/F8SL4NIIO34BHBS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F1G/JCA0/IO34BHA7/F1GJCA0IO34BHA7.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Select or Make Your Handle and Install"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Prepare to finish the handle by taping the hammer head off.

Also, keep an eye out for non-pallet wood - some of the best stuff I've found wasn't pallets.\nLook for oak pallets especially. Although they're tougher to work with, they're higher quality and will build lighter, stronger projects. But beggers can't be choosy; I end up with alot of pine pallets anyway.\nCAUTION: make SURE to get only pallets marked \"HT\" - \"heat treated.\" Anything else, even unmarked, don't touch, because they may use chemical treatment, which is potentially hazardous, especially to kids. Also, if something looks to have been spilled, don't touch it - it's not worth it to pick up a potentially chemical-soaked pallet and bring that into your home or yard.\nHere's someone else's Instructable that explains it better than I could:\nhttps://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-determine-i...\n2.

Phillips screws are frustrating; thank Henry Ford for that; or rather, the dude who held the patent on the square screw.\n3. Vinegar, #000 steel wool, and Hydrogen Peroxide: all cheap and easy to find at a Walmart. You'll especially want Hydrogen peroxide.

As you can see from the drawings, I'm somewhere between a cave-man and a hobby artist when it comes to design sketches...\nHere's the deal: I'm not going to walk you through my dimensions, etc. because you'll want to make this furniture custom-made for your place and your needs: think about what you want to go on there, any extra \"features\" (built in light? power cords hidden somewhere? etc.) I needed to put a printer, speakers, audio receiver, internet router/modem, 52 inch tv, and tablet computer on the desk, so this was my design - but customize yours to what you need!\nI can't say it enough: sketch out your project FIRST, piece by piece, so that you know where everything will be, and where it will be held together. Otherwise, you'll inevitably end up building something and halfway through realize you depending on something to stay put by magic. So:\n(1) start by measuring the space where you'll put it.\n(2) think about what you'll want to use it for; what you want to put on it that you can \"build around\", etc. and measure those items. Allow for some error, i.e. if your printer measures 8 inches across, allow for at least 10\" wide (1 inch on either side)\n(3) Remember that pallets aren't zero inches wide - be sure to account for the pallet width as you measure! (you may need to get the pallets first, measure their thickness, and then proceed. Pallets are usually around 3/4\" thick, 3\" wide, and ~32\" tall, but that varies.) So, for example, don't plan on your shelf to be 10 inches wide if you have pallets on the sides - plan for a 10\" wide shelf to be 10\" + 3/4\" + 3/4\" = 11 & 1/2\".\n(4) Once you have an idea of what you want, sketch it. Don't fixate on your first one; it may take a few sketches before you visualize what works best in your place. I would also suggest jotting down how many of each (roughly) board you'll need (see images).\n*note: sketch at least 4 angles: top, side, front, and \"perspective\". That way you have a good reference no matter what you're working on. I'd recommend that you even mentally\nAGAIN: make sure to think \"piece by piece.\" Think about where you'll put screws, etc. (that's where the extra-long screw bits from the last step come in - you'll need them sometimes!)\nKeep your drawing with you as you work to reference - you'll need it!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FX7/MLOY/IO1OVGAA/FX7MLOYIO1OVGAA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F67/H1H5/IO1OVGMR/F67H1H5IO1OVGMR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FPL/WNHA/IO1OVGVF/FPLWNHAIO1OVGVF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4Q/A16H/IO1OVGZU/F4QA16HIO1OVGZU.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Draw!"}, {"step": 3, "steps_text": "*As mentioned in the \"what you need\" section, ONLY get \"HT\" pallets. See here for someone's Instructible that explains it well.\nRepeat of what I mentioned in the introduction: Places to find free pallets: Craigslist, Home Depot/Lowes/Menards, etc.; driving around industrial zones and see them lying around.\nALWAYS ask permission, and always leave the place cleaner and more organized than you found it. I can't stress this - almost everywhere I've gone, people have given me permission, but then told me stories of other pallet hunters who've trashed the place. So don't ruin it for everyone else.\nHow to prepare the Pallets:\nThere are 3 typical ways I've seen people dismantle pallets; I've found there's not \"magic bullet\" way that will work for every pallet and situation, because sometimes you just want ALOT of pallets, and sometimes you want every last inch. Note that you (usually) won't be able to just pound the boards off the pallets because they use nails with glue that are devilishly hard to pull out. Don't plan on pulling them out.\nNote too, that I prefer getting a bunch of pallets, processing them, and then doing projects and pulling from a pre-cut pile. I find this is more efficient that processing one or two pallets for each project, and I can pick the best boards for the project this way.\nSo.\n(1) \"Specially-made crowbar\" method: Some people will use a specially-made pallet crowbar. I personally think this unnecessary and slows you down. Additionally, pallets are not all made of the finest wood; it doesn't make sense to me to buy a tool when the pallet is likely to crack anyways... but what do I know? So, I don't use this method.\n(2) \"Quick Method\": (See picture above with the two red-line cuts) The quickest way is to zip a circular saw down the inside edges of the pallet (where I've drawn the two straight red lines, pictured above). Then, work the pallets loose-ish by wobbling them like a steering wheel, back and forth, until you can slip a reciprocating saw in between each board and the frame to cut the nails that hold the board to the middle frame. You can process a pallet in about 10 minutes this way (once you get it down).\n(3) \"Full Board\" Method: (See picture above with red circle) use a hammer to tap (careful - it's easy to destroy the pallet) the board away from the frame, so that there's a tiny tiny gap between the frame and the board. Then, just take your reciprocating saw and slice through all the nails. This way takes about 20 minutes per pallet, but it allows you to get longer boards, which is sometimes essential to your project.\nMisc: note that I would recommend saving scraps from throughout the project - you'll be surprised how often they come in handy.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F47/D085/IO1OW8L6/F47D085IO1OW8L6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FZV/CGDI/IO1OVKE1/FZVCGDIIO1OVKE1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FYZ/T4LT/IO1OVCV3/FYZT4LTIO1OVCV3.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: Making It Palletable"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "Once you've processed the pallets, you'll want to use the chop saw to trim the boards to the necessary lengths. Make sure to be conscious about which side of the board is better (or worse) so that you're not chopping off the solid side and leaving the shattered end on your board. Note that you can use the table saw, but a chop saw will save you LOTS of time, and make your ends straighter. If you only have one, use a table saw, because sometimes you'll need to cut a board in half the long way - but a chop saw will make your cuts quite a bit more 90-degree-accurate, and be a huge time-saver.\nHere's where you may also want to use your nail-punch to pop out the nail heads that are leftover after you've sliced off the nails with your reciprocating saw. I try to leave the nail heads in my project, for looks, but occasionally there's a nail that poking a sharp end out; I just pop it out. It's not worth slicing someone's hand over the looks...\n*note: either at this point, or after you've put things together, you might want to take the box cutter and shave off the sharp edges.\nNow that you're done with processing the boards, you can start putting together the frame of your table!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FVW/I99C/IO1OWA7D/FVWI99CIO1OWA7D.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FS4/I83I/IO1OWAP0/FS4I83IIO1OWAP0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FB0/OXN7/IO1OWB47/FB0OXN7IO1OWB47.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTQ/FFU8/IO1OWMZP/FTQFFU8IO1OWMZP.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 4: Rock the Plank"}, {"step": 5, "steps_text": "Naturally, we build the frame first, then start hanging the other elements on the frame.

(*note to starters: never drill a screw without drilling the guide hole first; you will crack the board) See the hand-drawn diagram for an illustration of this.\nHere is where the extra-long screw bits come into play: a standard bit, or even a bit adapter won't be able to reach inside a 5/16\" hole to drive the screw in all the way.

How much steel wool you put it in depends on how dark you want the stain to be - you just have to experiment to get the proportions to your liking. Don't feel like you have to jam it full of steel wool, though - that's what I did the first time. Let this mixture sit for a while - the hot vinegar will rust, and oxidize the steel wool (i.e. rust it) and the rust will dissolve into the vinegar.\nstep 2: If things aren't going fast enough, add some magic: Hydrogen peroxide. Again, this stuff is great because it will, after a few days of light and normal heat, turn into water and be completely safe for kids or animals. Heck yes. The Hydrogen peroxide will instantly oxidize the steel wool. I freely admit: lately, when I need some stain, I skip the first step and just go right to Hydrogen peroxide - it's instant, and basically as cheap as vinegar.\n*some people add black tea to get a different color; but I've never tried that.

A pile of tools. No one wants that. I got lucky and snagged a road case from Apex Electronics Surplus in Los Angeles for about $30. It is a wonderland of a junkyard, with an incredible blend of entertainment industry garbage and aviation industry garbage. They have props (both kinds) galore, a ton of weird electronics, and a pile of oscilloscopes so tall it would crush you if you sneezed. Don\u2019t buy too big, or it will weigh too much to move.I would strongly recommend a road case, but there are lots of boxes out there. There are great resources for making your own, which could be really fun.

When cutting the two wood pieces, make sure that you try to make them as even as possible.

Because of safety concerns, it is best to have a bigger piece of wood so that there is no possibility of injuries on the saw.\n3. When using the Scroll Saw, make sure that you are holding the piece of wood very tightly. Because of the blades up-and-down movement the piece of wood will also be vibrating.

If you don't have the ability to easily make an angled cut just leave the top edge flat making sure that the underside of the roof contacts the top of the feeder sides to seal out the elements and help keep the seed dry. Photos #3 and #5 show an optional plexiglass cover that can be fitted inside the feeder for additional protection.\nHere are the steps to prepare the feeder sides:\n1) Cut a 45 degree bevel on the top edge of each side.\n2) Center a 1/2\" to 3/4\" deep groove in the lower edge of each side to accept the plexiglass feeder windows. A standard width saw kerf should be sufficient.\n3) Cut two pieces of plexiglass to fit in the grooves of the feeder sides.This can be done on the table saw (which is much easier than scoring the material and snapping it apart).\n-Size the plexiglass pieces so they will leave at least 1/2\" opening at the feeder base after the sides are nailed to the feeder ends.\n- Insert the plexiglass in the feeder sides and then drill three small pilot holes (on the seed side) to tack the plexiglass in place with nails (photo #2).\n4) Optional: Attach a wood strip an inch or so below the top of each feeder side (photo #1). Then cut a plexiglass cover to rest on the wood strips, keeping excessive moisture from prematurely spoiling the seed (photos #3 & #5). To provide easy removal of the cover, attach a wire handle as shown or simply glue a small block of wood to the top of the cover.\n6) Position and nail the feeder sides in place (photos #3 & #4).\n7) Finally, cut two more pieces of plexiglass to rest on the cutoffs that were nailed to the bottom of the feeder ends (forming an inverted \"v\"). This will create a seed diverter funnelling a constant stream of seed through the opening on the feeder sides. To hold the plexiglass in place, nail 4 small wood blocks to the base.

When adding a suet holder simply make it based on the size of the product need it to hold.\nRoof Trim\nWhen the roof is in set in place you may have very small gaps where the feeder ends and the roof meet (I did). The best way to hide these slight imperfections (while also creating a better seal) is to attach small pieces of trim to the feeder ends or roof. As seen in photo #4, I added trim to one side of the roof which also helps hold the roof in place a little more securely. On the other side I attached the trim to the feeder end. Both pieces of trim hid the gaps and eliminated the chances of moisture entering the feeder in a heavy rain.\nStaining the roof will help seal the seam at the peak of the roof and is highly recommended.

We got both the sheathing and the rafters from a local mill at roughly half the cost of getting the same wood at Home Depot (HD), and they give you lumber that is cut to the indicated size rather than to the 'nominal' dimensions... a 2 x 4 is actually 2\" x 4\" rather than 1.5\" x 3.5\". The rough sawn lumber does require more sorting... if you get to pick out the boards, make sure to select straight, un-cracked boards. Also you should buy 5-10% more boards than you need to account for any short boards that may come in the mix. Be particularly careful to select straight pieces when you are selecting rafters.

Using skids cheaply gives us the ability to move the shed to different places in the yard or even up on top of a flatbed trailer to relocate.\nThe first thing to do is to clear the 15' x 25' area you will be building the shed on. Make sure you have easy access to electricity and air if you plan to use an air-nailer.\nOnce the area is clear, dig in your patio blocks so as to provide raised shoes on which to place the skids and subsequently build the shed. We decided to position one patio block on the ends of each skid, and one in the middle of each.\nThen proceed to construct your skids. For each skid we used three 2\" x 6\" x 16\" pressure-treated timbers nailed together with ten penny nails. We cut off a lower triangle at both ends of the skid so that the skid could ride over irregularities in the ground. It is important to use a rot-resistant wood for the skids because they often get wet/damp from splash back. Instead of PT, consider using black locust or cedar. Unfortunately our lumber mill didn't provide either, but I recommend asking!\nStand the skids on the positioned patio blocks. Then put the level on the skids to ensure they are level.

Attach to the skids with 3\" deck screws. We used two screws per connection (four per deck board.)\nDon't be nervous if the overhanging ends do not align! We used 3.5\" carriage bolts to connect each board to a perpendicular 2\"x4\"x16'. This both provides more strength in the overhung sections and provides a purchase for the sheathing to be nailed to. This piece was put on top of the decking in the back and directly underneath the decking in the front so that any equipment brought in would not have to ride over the lip.\nAt this point, there is the option of beveling your doorway threshold. You can do this by setting your circular saw at something like a 45 degree angle and cutting off the top triangle in front of the door. I strongly recommend using a guide to make a straight cut. You can set up a guide by clamping a straight piece of wood to the deck that you can run the saw's fence along. We did not make a bevel on the front lip.\nNow you should have a lovely deck that is 14' 8\" x 8' in area. This will be the internal area of your final shed!

The frame is also responsible for resisting sideways forces due to wind, ground level changes, and, most of all, when you go to move the shed. In this step I will go over the techniques of how to start the frame and how to construct some of the trickier corner joints in the frame. Please refer to the SketchUp model for exact dimensions.\nBefore you build the frame, you should make sure that your desk is as level as possible. This involves putting your level on various parts of the deck and ensuring that the bubble stays pretty close to the center. You can adjust the height of the concrete 'shoes' with additional shims as needed (make sure to use PT for your shims!) I cannot overemphasize how important it is that your deck is level so that you may use gravity to determine whether your posts are vertical. If the deck isn't level, your posts will not form a 90 degree corner with the deck, and your shed will be skewed like the Leaning Tower of Pisa!\nOnce you are positing the deck is vertical, install the two 2 x 6 PT pieces that stand on their side at either end of the shed. You should notch them with the circular saw so they can overlap the back 2 x 4. These pieces help support the end posts. Install them by screwing those 3\" decking screws up through the deck and into the piece. You should put quite a few screws in... perhaps 15 per piece, evenly spaced at one every 6\". Why so many screws? Because it is critical that this piece is well fastened to the deck to reduce movement.\nNext we installed the back posts. This is a two-person job. First, measure the size of the to-be lap joint (see pic 3) to determine the locations of the two cuts you need to make. These cuts will enable you to correctly overlap the post on the board you installed in step 2. We used a circular saw to make a cut 1.5\" in through the end grain of the post (be careful, this is a rather dangerous cut because you are cutting perpendicular to the grain.) Our circular saw was not large enough to cut the required 4\", so we set it as beep as it could go, made the other cut (1.5\" deep, 4\" up from the base), and then connected the cuts with a hand saw. Using the handsaw to finish a cut with the circular saw is a common technique we will employ throughout this 'ible.\nNow that your post is properly notched, you can start putting up the vertical posts! First you need eight (two for each of the four posts) diagonal bracing boards that will temporarily hold the posts up. We used cut-offs that were 2-3' long. I cut perpendicular 45 degree cuts in either end so as to form a regular trapezoid. This enables us to cleanly install the diagonal braces such that they don't extend past the posts and interfere with the siding installation.\nTo install one post, partially drive one 2\"-2.5\" screw in either end of the diagonal braces such that the point of the screw just barely pushes through the surface. Then screw two of the diagonal braces into the inside of the shed as seen in the pictures. There should be two floppy ends that can swing on the single pivot screw. That will enable us to move the post so that it is perfectly vertical before 'locking it in' with the diagonal braces.\nNow bring your post over to the diagonal braces and use a couple 3\" deck screws to fasten it to the 5.5\" tall side board. I don't recommend going up through the deck because you never want to screw into the end grain of a post. This requires a friend to hold the post roughly vertical (no need to check right now) while you screw the base in. The post should now be pretty easy to pivot, but won't fall down.\nNow we need to fix the post so that it is vertical in both dimensions constrained by the braces (front to back and side to side with respect to the shed. To do so, only focus on one dimension at a time. Hold your level against the outer edge of the post, and pivot until the post is perfectly level. At that point, have your friend hold the post in place while you screw the corresponding diagonal brace into the vertical post to lock it in. Then repeat with the other dimension. Your post should now be vertical!\nNow you can put up all four of your posts in the exact same way! Note that the diagonal bracing for your front posts will have to go on the outside of the building and will eventually interfere with the siding... but we'll take those off before applying the siding.\nThe next step is to install the headers. The vertical posts, with the diagonal braces, should be strong enough to support a front and back header. If they easily wobble with a small push, you may need to add some more, larger diagonal braces. Build each header from two 2\" x 6\" x 16' nailed together. If you'd like the inside edge of the post line up with the inside edge of the header, you need to add a 0.5\" shim between the two 2\" x 6\" x 16' pieces of lumber to make up the full 3.5\" thickness of the posts.\nTo install the front header, place a step ladder on either side of the shed and have you and the friend walk up either side and place the header with the outside facing edge flush with the outside of the posts. Make sure an even length is overhanging on either end, and toenail the header onto the posts... at least 4 3\" nails or screws in each post.\nNow repeat with the back posts, making sure the outside edges line up.\nNow you should have something looking like the last photo posted!

To draw the necessary cuts, you need to determine the angle made between the horizontal and the roof, known as the pitch of the roof. For the designed shed, this should be 2'/6' or arctan(1/3)=18.4 degrees. If you have a protractor, you can dial in 90 degrees + 18.4 degrees = 108.4 degrees and use it to draw the 'vertical' cut of the notch. If this is far too confusing, perhaps this drawing will help.\nCutting the Rafter\nTo cut ends of the rafter, we used a cut-off saw set to the requisite 108.4 degrees. This allowed us to cut all of the ends very quickly. The notches took a tiny bit more work. For these, we used a circular saw to get the bulk of the material cut, and then we joined the two circular saw cuts with a few strokes of the hand saw.\nInstalling the Rafters\nTo install the rafters, we first marked all the spacing on the headers, placed the rafters accordingly, and used a ladder of the front to screw in the hurricane ties.

It took a long time, and it was noisy, grueling labor. If you can buy the boards pre-shiplapped, we recommend buying those! Also, if you don't mind small vertical cracks forming in your shed when the rough sawn shrinks and changes size, no need to shiplap! However, if you insist on shiplapping all the boards by yourself, then read on.\nYour Workspace\nTo make sure your shiplapping is as fast and smooth as possible, it's a good idea to carefully set up your workspace. We used a 5/8\" wide Dato blade to make the grooves in our rough sawn boards, so the table saw was the main attraction. However, you could use a table-mounted router. The Dato blade made a lot of sawdust, so we made sure to connect it to a shop vacuum. Lastly, it is important that the wood getting fed into the table saw has an easy approach. We accomplished this by using a flip-top table meant to support long pieces of wood as they get fed into the saw. This worked very well, but any surface at roughly the same height would also do.\nSetting Up the Saw\nYour goal is to remove roughly half of the board's thickness for a half inch deep. Set the height of the saw, then run a couple test pieces through to confirm that one half of the height is being cut. We had the saw set such that the blade was right against the saw fence. This way, the saw could only undercut, which could be easily fixed by running the board through another time.\nCutting\nOnce the saw is set, and some small test pieces were successfully cut, it's time to put on your ear muffs and spend the next four hours or so shiplapping boards. We determined it took us about 3-5 minutes per board.

The purpose is to provide an additional place to nail sheathing to, ensuring that the sheathing doesn't buckle too far. To install the girts, simply mark at what height you would like the ends to be on the post, cut the 2\" x 4\" to length, and toe-screw them into the side of the posts. The corner created by the posts and the girts will also serve as a convenient place to butt one end of the diagonal braces against.\nDiagonal Braces\nThe diagonal braces are necessary to keep the shed from diagonalizing/parallelograming in any dimension. Therefore we must reinforce all planes of the shed... front and back, sides and roof. We will assume the floor can properly oppose diagonalizing forces (especially with no wind load!). There are two types of diagonal braces to discuss: wooden and metal strapping. Wooden braces can only resist compression forces, so for whichever plane we use wooden braces for, we'll need to put them in both directions at roughly ninety degrees from one another. Metal strapping, on the other hand, can only resist tension forces, and consequently it will also have to reinforce a given plane in both directions. We chose to use wooden braces for all sides of the shed because of the aesthetic, and metal strapping for the roof because it is thinner and hence could easily fit between the purlins and the rafters. Before installing any of the diagonal braces, make sure that the plane you are installing them to is perfectly square. The easiest way to mark the wooden braces is to hold them up to the location, and use the frame as a guide for your marker. Then cut along the marker lines, and your brace should fit right in! Remember, the wooden braces are only for compression, so any toe-nails/toe-screws you put in need only keep the brace from moving side to side. For the metal strapping, we used one continuous band of strapping that formed a V on the plane of the roof. Install the metal strapping by nailing it to all of the rafters. Make sure that the ends that take the majority of the tension force are bent over the side and nailed in to give them greater strength. Once all of these braces are installed, you will immediately notice how much stronger the shed has become!", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FK2/I4OZ/IDCXFJT6/FK2I4OZIDCXFJT6.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8B/MO6K/IDCXFJTA/F8BMO6KIDCXFJTA.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F3S/91FQ/IDCXFJT9/F3S91FQIDCXFJT9.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSD/XKTC/IDCXFJTB/FSDXKTCIDCXFJTB.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUT/5JYP/IDCXFJTD/FUT5JYPIDCXFJTD.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD1/O7EJ/IDCXFJTC/FD1O7EJIDCXFJTC.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKY/I3NG/IDCXFJTN/FKYI3NGIDCXFJTN.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F6N/WC2Z/IDCXFJTR/F6NWC2ZIDCXFJTR.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FD0/98LI/IDCXFJTT/FD098LIIDCXFJTT.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTD/5C3B/IDCXFJTS/FTD5C3BIDCXFJTS.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FSO/ZJW3/IDCXFJTL/FSOZJW3IDCXFJTL.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F46/PX0C/IDCXFJTZ/F46PX0CIDCXFJTZ.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FT7/DV80/IDCXFJTI/FT7DV80IDCXFJTI.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FST/VSFA/IDCXFJXF/FSTVSFAIDCXFJXF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F8F/VS5O/IDCXFJU1/F8FVS5OIDCXFJU1.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FST/PQU0/IDCXFJTX/FSTPQU0IDCXFJTX.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FDF/5Q33/IDCXFJU4/FDF5Q33IDCXFJU4.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FJU/KDSG/IDCXFJU5/FJUKDSGIDCXFJU5.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F4Z/B5AF/IDCXFJXP/F4ZB5AFIDCXFJXP.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FTU/SP6P/IDCXFJY8/FTUSP6PIDCXFJY8.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FIM/IIUN/IDCXFJXY/FIMIIUNIDCXFJXY.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FN0/S46L/IDCXFK0T/FN0S46LIDCXFK0T.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FWA/SBFQ/IDCXFK1V/FWASBFQIDCXFK1V.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 8: Installing Girts and Diagonal Braces"}, {"step": 9, "steps_text": "Installing the sheathing is perhaps the most straight forward and rewarding step in the whole process.

In my situation I ordered freshly cut lumber since that was that cheapest option. The downside was that I had to wait a few weeks untill the miller had my order ready. I also searched for a small lumbermill that had a nice price per m3. Here in Holland prices seem to vairy alot! Would I order the lumber (only for the pillars and ring beams) directly from a store it would set me back at least 600 to 800 euros. The lumbermill where I finaly placed my order charged me 350 euro.\n\nI could have picked oak instead of douglas pine but that would almost double the price. A plus side of Douglas pine is that the wood is very soft and thus very easy to work with.\n\nSo I bought to following:\n\n- 15x15cm Douglas pine for pillars and support beams 350 euro\n\n- 2x20cm Douglas pine boards for cladding the sides and the rooftrimming 200 euro\n\n- 4x4cm normal pine beams for roof support 50 euro\n\n- OSB sheets (pressure glued sheets) 125 euro\n\n- EPDM incl adhesive (rubber cloth like you use in ponds only better suited against UV from the sun) 300 euro\n\n- Screws and wire ends 25 euro\n\nEnd total is a bit more then the initially budgetted 1000 but hey, who's counting.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FBV/7ABM/IO0GFS8C/FBV7ABMIO0GFS8C.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F0B/YONQ/IO0GFS8G/F0BYONQIO0GFS8G.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FKX/THN7/IO0GFW23/FKXTHN7IO0GFW23.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 1: Ordering Lumber and Materials"}, {"step": 2, "steps_text": "For the foundation there are a couple of methods you can use. In another instructable I made about a toolshed I painted the pillars with anti-rot and put them directly into the ground. That was pressure treated wood and the Douglas pine I am using in this build is not. So I need the pillars to be above ground to prevent rotting wood. That means I need some solid foundation and a construction that lifts the pillars above groundlevel. There are different methods for this aswell. You can use U-shaped clamps that can be fastened in the cement. The pillar can then be mounted between the U-shape with a few screws. You can also use PVC or some other flexible water resistant material in between the concrete foudation and the wooden pillar. Just make sure the water can not get high enough so it can touch the wood.\n\nI chose for a simple and cheap solution: M20 wire ends. These pretty heavy wire ends are 30cm long en have 1 extra feature: you can use the nuts to adjust the pillar height in case you have made a error. I also made a few big washers (4x4cm) out of some steel plating. These go in between the nut and the wooden pillar.\n\nThen it came down to carefully measuring out where the wire ends needed to go. I used rope and a tapemeasure to align everything and I eyeballed the depth of the wire ends. For each hole I used 1 bag (25kg) of quick drying cement. One of the corners was taken up by a big stone planterbox (hey, another instuctable about that pretty soon!) so I had to drill a hole in the stone. I made a very watery cement paste that I poured into the hole before I put the wire end in it.

Personally I love this kind of woodworking although I'm just a bloke with a few tools and not a proffesional by any standards.\n\nI started with cutting 5 wooden pillars to the exact same lenght. (and 1 shorter for ontop of the planterbox) You'll need to get the misses involved here since this step is crucial in sorting out the overall hight of your patio. So you don't get blamed afterwards. I believe we went with 2,15 meters.\n\nThen I drilled a hole in the center of the pillar. Just draw a few lines from corner to corner to find the exact center. Before I put the pillars on the wire ends I poured a bit of constructionglue in the hole and made sure the nut and washer where at about the right hight on the wire end. As soon as the pillar was on the wire end I quicky braced it with a few scraps of wood and checked if the pillar was level and square. Note that you can still adjust the height with the nut. When all 6 pillars where in place I checked the measurements again and did some tuning up.\n\nNow it was time for the beams. My method was simple: no measuring when you don't have to. Just put a beam ontop of 2 pillars and trace the end with a pencil or something sharp. You can't go wrong. Ofcourse you'll need to measure other things very carefully like the depth of the cuts for the joints. For the joints I chose the interlock the beams by cutting a half out of every beam so they would fit neatly into eachother.

This is also the step I would like to redo. I absolutly hate the look and feel afterwards. I was planning on a lower (double) ceiling I would be putting in later together with LED spots. This way the cheap pine beams and the OSB sheets could not be seen. When I tried that it just didn't look right. The lower ceiling made the whole structure look as if it was build to low. So i scrapped the double ceiling and now I'm left with these cheap materials in sight. Not everything can go alright I geuss. Perhaps i'll scrap the whole roof and make a nice triangular roof when I have the time. Not sure yet.\n\nAnyway, the cheap pine beams and OSB is simply screwed inplace. Nothing fancy here. When that was done I made an upright ledge ontop of the roof around the edges. I made a diagonal cut along the lenght of a pine beam to get 2 exactly the same looking triangular shapes. I did this to avoid gleuing in the EPDM rubber in a 90 degree inward bend. The EPDM kit came with a gutter piece that took a bit of brutal hammering to get in the right shape.\n\nThen it was time to get gleuing on the EPDM rubber. This stuff is exactly the same as the rubber you use in a pond except that it is better suited against the UV radiation from the sun that dry's out rubber over time. Whenever I need to glue in EPDM again I'm not going to do it the way I did it with this patio build. I glued up the first half and then the second half. Those pieces where way to big to handle since the rubber is massive and heavy. This stuff is very sticky aswell and it almost turned out wrong. I still have a few nasty folds that I couldn't roll out afterwards. Next time I will spread the rubber, lay it precisely in place and then roll it op to 1 side.

I'm making this new beer caddy and of course it can't be a straightforward design ... that would be way to easy. On no ...

Next hurdle was determining spacing and positioning of 6 bottles, which would dictate the overall length and width.\n\nMy Design Process [Refer to picture 1 in this section]\n1. Starting with 1/4\" graph paper, I drew centered vertical and horizontal lines.\n2. With a mini-compass set to a radius of 1 5/16\" (2 5/8\" diameter) and found a point on the horizontal line where I could draw a circle ... with some space between it an the center line. I lucked out .. you can see the circle fits pretty comfortable with a 3\" x 3\" square.\n3. Using this information, I drew out the grid work for six 3\" x 3\" squares.\n4. Since my construction method would have panels inset within grooves, I added 1/4\" to each side. This gave me final dimensions of 6 1/2\" x 9 1/2\".\nNote: These dimensions can easily be altered to accommodate any bottle size.\n\nI don't have a 2 5/8\" forstner bit and I didn't want to buy one for a one off project, so I had to make a template so I could cut consistent holes using a router and pattern bit.\n\nMaking The Template\n1. Cut a piece of 1/2\" plywood to 6 1/2\" x 9 1/2\".\n2. Draw the centered vertical and horizontal lines.\n3. The centers of all 6 circles can now be found by making marks 1 3/4\" in from the edges\n4. The remaining two holes fall on the vertical line ... 3 1/4\" in from the edge. This will be for the posts, which will make sense later.\n\nDrilling out the template\n1. Mark the center points with an awl.\n2. Drill out the holes using the drill press and a 2\" forstner bit. I drill most of the way through from one side (just enough for the point to pierce through), but finish the hole from the opposite side to eliminate blow out.\n3. Using a rabbeting bit and bearing set, enlarge the diameter of the hole to 2 5/8\". Notice I have the bit height set to remove half of the board thickness, which leaves enough 2\" diameter material for the bearing to register against, yet enough for the last step. [Picture #4]\n4. Switch the bearing to the largest size, which transforms the rabbeting bit into a pattern bit (or use a separate pattern bit if you desire). The bearing will now ride against the 2 5/8\" diameter, while the cutter removes the remaining material.\n5.

Cut the 1/2\" x 4\" poplar board to the 38\" length and then rip it to a width of 2 3/4\" using the table saw.\n2. Set the blade height to 1/4\", set the fence to 1/4\", and rip a groove into the face of the board on each side.\n3. Nudge the fence out 1/8\" (to 3/8\") and run the board again to widen the grooves. This should be enough for the hardboard to just fit into the boards ... if not, nudge a bit more and recut.\n4. At this point, one groove is done, but the other needs to be wide enough for the plywood panel ... so keep moving the fence and making passes until you meet that goal. No need to get greedy ... take light passes towards the end, so you don't end up with gaps and/or a loose panel. [Picture #4]\n\nThe last step is to cut the box sides to size with miters. I couldn't cut the 2 3/4\" sides using my miter sled, because the blade doesn't raise high enough, so I used my 45 degree tilt small parts crosscut sled. Also, I make things harder on myself because I like the look of continuous grain wrapping around my boxes. In a perfect world, I would have a sled with two flip down stop blocks for interlaced repeatability (future sleds will have this), but I devised a method using the fence and a spacer block.\n\nSharing my measurements won't help, unless you have this exact same saw with the exact same fence (Ridgid TS2400LS), but I can share my method. I used the fence and a scrap block that was 1 1/2\" thick. I set my fence, place the block against the fence, then my work piece against the block. Once I had the work piece secure, I'd remove the block and make my cut. It's the same principle as using the miter gauge on a table saw ... you don't want to ride the work piece against the fence and end up with binding and possible kickback.\nNow if you do happen to have this exact same table saw, my long side setting was 10 5/16\" and my short side setting was 7 5/16\".\n\nCutting The Sides (I started with a short side)\nNote: I have a left tilt saw\n1. Cut the initial miter on one end of the board with the grooves facing up. That puts the grooves on the inside of the box.

It also works with LinuxCNC and Mach3. My low power integrated driver is also available for sale on Tindie.\n---\nI made this laser engraver mostly for cutting stencils for my PCBs but its applications are limited only by your imagination and the laser power. Most PCBs today have SMD components. You can solder these by placing the solder paste with a syringe on each pad but thats time consuming and not to mention impossibly tedious. For small batch runs its just unfeasible and that means getting stencils created. The regular Kapton and Mylar ones are reasonably priced but the aluminium ones are expensive.\nI thought about getting a Silhouette Cameo cutter but I finally decided against it since the cutting resolution is limited to about 0.5mm (and that too with really slow cutting and some expensive materials). The answer - a laser!! The powerful 40W CO2 lasers are really expensive and we really don't need that kinda power to cut transparency sheets or mylar and neither are the really low power 300-500mA ones. Hence I opted for a 1.6W laser which can cut through acrylic sheets as well (upto 3mm thick) with multiple passes.\nBefore we really dive into it, a genuine you'll-weep-if-you-don't-pay-heed-to-this warning.

Lasers can burn the corneas in your eyes and make you permanently blind (the operative words being \"permanent\" and \"blind\"). Hence safety goggles are a MUST! I'm not responsible for any damages caused to you or by you by following this build.\nAnother warning: Even though the end outputs are low currents and voltages, they are still powerful enough to give nasty jolts. So don't go touching live wires or stick them on your tongue to see how they taste (you'd be surprised as to how many folks do this to check batteries).\nYou can get your safety goggles from ebay or Amazon for as low as $8.

These motors are for the Y-axis motion. You can do with a single motor but they tend to arch the axis and hence lose resolution.\nInsert the M5 x 30mm screws in the fixed hole slots. Use three M5 nuts as spacers and then insert the delrin wheels on to them. Fix everything in place with the nylon locking nut (part of the V-wheel kit).\nNow fix the other two screws in the adjustable holes. You can move these based on how smooth you want the motion on the V-slots.\nThe motors are easily mounted using the 4 fixed holes. I used M3 x 10mm screws for this.\nDon't tighten the pulley's on the motor just yet. Once the mount is fixed to the V-slots, you'll need to feed the belt and based on its position you'll need to tighten the pulley. Build these but don't mount them on the X-axis carriage just yet.\nOn with the X carriage mount. The process is pretty much the same as the Y-axis mounts except here you slide the mount on the V-slot that will serve as the X-axis. I mounted the laser towards the end since I didn't want it being damaged during the build. Fix the cable carriers below the X-axis V-slot. These are also 3D printed and they slide into the V-slot. Now fix the two Y-axis mounts on either side of the X-axis locking the laser and X-axis mount.\nLoosely attach the belt tensioners on the X-axis ends. Thread the belt through one end and tighten this end. Now thread the belt below the wheels and over the pulley to the other end. Slightly tug on the belt to make sure its taut and there is very little slack and now screw tight the belt tensioner on the other end. Be sure to get the pulley locks in with the tooth part of the belt. This means that the wheels slide over the smooth part.\nYou'll need to collect all your wires on one side of the machine. Hence be sure to thread the motor (one of the Y-axis motors and the X-axis motor) the laser and limit switches (if you've configured them, I have not) through the wire carriers underneath.

First you'll need to insert the bearings in the holes shown above. They need to fit in snugly and not move. You may have to lightly sand the inner side of the holes to make then fit. Don't put too much pressure if it wont fit. That will crack the mount and make it unusable.\nThen insert a 4-inch M3 screw through the top bearing and then through the laser mount. The laser mount block itself has two slots for M3 nuts. these also fit snugly on the mounts. Much of this mounting is easily visible once you have the blocks with you (sorry no pictures for that). Make sure you have two M3 screws on either sides of the bearing locking the 4-inch screw in place. As you turn the screw the laser mount moves up and down accordingly. Essentially we've converted rotary motion into a linear one, much like what the steppers do.\nAlso use 3mm metal rods that act as supports for the laser mount and keep it straight and levelled.\nWhy is the manual Z-axis motion needed?\nWith a laser, the beam is focussed on the cutting board below. However, the material thickness offsets this focus. With really thin materials such as films and paper this does not effect much, however with slightly thicker materials this reduces the laser power transferred on to the surface. This mount allows you to move the laser up by the thickness of the material and hence ensure that the correct focus is maintained all throughout. If you are doing multiple passes to cut, say 2mm plastics, with every 3rd cut you can lower the laser by about 0.5mm till you've reached the calibrated laser focus. I've pasted a printed scale in millimeters on the side of the mount and attached a needle on the top of the laser mount to show me exactly where the laser is perfectly focused.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FJT/YGER/INYU3222/FJTYGERINYU3222.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/F55/HIIF/INYU3246/F55HIIFINYU3246.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FAR/K4XY/INYU325P/FARK4XYINYU325P.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FLY/04SN/INYU3273/FLY04SNINYU3273.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 3: The Laser Mount"}, {"step": 4, "steps_text": "The Y-axis mounts are relatively less complex to build.

These two V-slots need to be exactly the same length.\nI drilled and threaded two holes on each side of the two Y-axes. I then placed these these on top of the aluminium bars completing the frame and locking both the Y-axis motors within the frame span.\nSimilar to the X-axis mounts, You'll need to mount end caps on each side of the Y-axis.

There are plenty of motor drivers and I'm using the A4988 ones. They are quite cheap and they've served my purpose really well. You could mount these on a breadboard but I made a nice PCB for these (the Gerbers and schematics are attached here). These connect to the Arduino loaded with GRBL.\nThis link from Pololu shows exactly how to connect the A4988 to the stepper motors and how to set the current limit on them. Pay special attention to how the current limit is set. Out of the box, no reliable current limit is set on the A4988s.\nIn my board, there are two jumpers that allows two drivers to share the same step and direction signal for the two Y-axis motors - XY STEP and XY DIR. When set, the bottom two A4988s drive the two Y-axis motors based on the same step and direction inputs from the Arduino. One important point of note: The two Y-axis motors rotate in opposite directions since they are on either side of the X-axis. Hence one of the Y-axis motors needs to be reversed in direction. This can be done by reversing the motor coils in comparison with the other Y-axis motor.\nGRBL is the software that coverts location information on the XYZ plane to machine code and translates it for the motor drivers that then drive the motors to that specific location. In our case we've used only the X-Y plane. More on how to install GRBL is described later in the build.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FSK/G94X/INYU31B3/FSKG94XINYU31B3.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FNI/3PWZ/INYU31GO/FNI3PWZINYU31GO.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 5: The Motor Drivers"}, {"step": 6, "steps_text": "This is probably the most important part of the build. Most modern diode-based lasers need to be driven using constant currents. The one I got was a Osram PLTB450B from DTR's laser shop. I chose this one because in case of an excess current these simply shut down and when the current comes back in the specified range they start lasing again. These are rated for about 2A but I would advise against driving them at that value to prolong their lifetime. The driver described here drives it at 1A constant current and is rated upto 1.4A maximum.\nThere are plenty of laser drivers available but they are expensive and I did not need any of the additional features. With this driver, there is no way to modulate or control the laser power which is needed when you want to engrave images with varying shades of grey.\nThis driver is based on ST's ST1CC40 constant current LED driver. It has many of the characteristics that are necessary for the laser too such as a soft start. The driver accepts a 12V input and outputs 1A upto 5.5V. The Gerbers and schematic for this driver is attached here.\nIf you are using this driver, a point of note: Do not connect both the INH headers and the MCU input. If you use the INH headers, the driver can be used as a standalone 1A constant current source. If you connect the MCU input, you'd be able to turn the laser on and off from the Arduino.\nIt is also advisable to get a heatsink for the laser. I bought a 51mm x 51mm heatsink with a small 12V fan in it from ebay. These are quite commonly available. The laser mount attaches to the fan heatsink as shown in the images. I did away with some of the paint inside the laser mount and used a little heatsink material between the laser module and the mount.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/FG6/CKTG/INYU31CF/FG6CKTGINYU31CF.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUZ/VGHG/INYU33H0/FUZVGHGINYU33H0.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FID/ANKM/INYU312W/FIDANKMINYU312W.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FVB/TQ36/INYU3135/FVBTQ36INYU3135.LARGE.jpg", "https://cdn.instructables.com/FUW/FT7F/INYU317R/FUWFT7FINYU317R.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 6: The Laser Driver"}, {"step": 7, "steps_text": "Its time to connect it all together and install the software.\nYou'll first need to install GRBL on Arduino. This is fairly straight forward. Download GRBL from here. Unzip the grbl-master.zip and you'll see another folder called grbl here. Add this folder as a library in Arduino. Now all you have to do is restart Arduino, select grbl from the File > Examples and hit Upload.\nYou can verify the upload by opening the serial monitor and you'll see the GRBL opening lines along with its version.\nSetting up GRBL\nBefore we get started, you'll need to configure GRBL to your motor specifics and the required resolution (or micro-steps). I've set mine to 1/16 microstep (this is also listed on the Pololu page). This means that every motor resolution is divided into 3200 microsteps. Be careful when using this level of micro-stepping since higher stepping usually comes at the cost of reduced torque.\nSince we've used a 20-tooth pulley and a 2mm timing belt, we need to calculate steps per mm count for GRBL. You can use this handy calculator from Reprap for this. For us this count is 80. From the serial terminal you will need to type $ and press enter to change this value for the X and Y steps/mm. You can similarly change other values. I've not touched the homing settings in mine since I'm not using it in my setup. Its a good idea to set the maximum X and Y limits the motor will travel and the acceleration values as well. I've set my acceleration values as 6000 for X and Y and left the Z untouched (since I'm not using the Z axis).\nYou'll also need to connect Step and Dir pins to Arduino. For the X-axis connect to Arduino D2 (step) and D5 (dir) and for Y-axis this is set to D3 and D6. Connect the laser to D11. Remember that all grounds on all boards should be connected. The Arduino is powered through the USB of the connected machine.\nThere are plenty of softwares for interpreting G-code, the language that GRBL outputs. The two that I love are grblControl and bCNC.\nInkscape is the preferred choice for converting vector graphics into Gcode and the latest version of Inkscape comes preloaded with G-codetools which is very handy. I won't go into the details of how to use these since there are awesome instructables and tutorials on these on the web.\nI eventually mounted the entire setup on a plywood board cut to size which has a 1mm Aluminium sheet on it.

Don't use screws because you will see them when you are done. Since it is used wood you don't have to be very precise. Everyting does not have to be super straight or level.

It all comes down on your own preference and situation.\nWhen the box was done I took my angle grinder and roughed up the wood to make it look even more weathered. The last step was sanding the whole thing down (not to much!) with grid 120.\nTime for the electrics! Well this step was pretty easy. I just made 2 holes in the box for the electrical wire.

I used a few pieces of wood to roughly determine the size of the lift, and went on from there.\nFor the record, the sizes I used for my Ryobi CR1000VT router and Ryobi RT610 router table were: Total length of handle 450 mm, distance between shafts 100 mm, hight of fulcrum shaft 80 mm, and width of shaft beneath the router 80 mm.\nThe handle and its counterpart member on the other side were fixed to the fulcrum shaft with glue and screws. The fulcrum shaft rotates in two sockets in the uprights made with a 19 mm spade drill bit.\nThe shaft beneath the router bottom is fixed between its wooden supports with two screws, just loose enough that it can rotate.\nThe one upright is permanently fixed to the base with glue and screws, while the other upright is fixed only with screws to facilitate disassembly. I've found that it is unnecessary to fix the base to anything. When engaged, the power of the router's springs keep it in place. It is also easy to just slide it away when it's necessary to detach the router from the router table. The base should of course be big enough that the lift doesn't topple over.\nRemember that the lift will probably only work if the router table is fixed to the bench top, otherwise it will simply lift the table and router up off the bench. I fixed my router table on a big piece of pine shelving to overcome that problem.\nThe sockets for the fulcrum shaft and the ends of the router shaft can be lubricated with candle wax or dry soap.\nI hope this design will be of use to one or more DIY'ers.", "step_imgs": ["https://cdn.instructables.com/F1P/13QV/INUV6Q7P/F1P13QVINUV6Q7P.LARGE.jpg"], "step_title": "Step 2: Building the Router Lift"}], "channel": "Woodworking"}, {"category": "Workshop", "description": "Executive Summary: How to customize your tool belt in minutes with pop-rivets and an old belt.

One of his most essential tools is a \"proper tool belt\".\nI admired how nicely his tools were organized and secure on an Occidental Leather company tool belt. There's even a slot for a speed square... brilliant I thought to myself as I could imagine the sound of dropping my speed square yet again. What a thoughtful design! Wranglestar's Occidental belt is a handsome and functional belt; it would probably last me a lifetime but at this point I don't do enough of my own work to justify the cost.\nSo, my wheels started turning as I looked over my single pouch Sears tool belt that I picked up with a mixed lot of tools from kijjiji.

For instance I'm right handed and want my hammer on my right and a draw bag for fasteners on my left. Now take stock of the organization system already on your tool belt and think about you can get from point A to point functional tool belt.\nInitially I was going to create a strap across the back of the tool bag to tuck in my speed square but each time I tried to slide it in I poked myself in the gut.
